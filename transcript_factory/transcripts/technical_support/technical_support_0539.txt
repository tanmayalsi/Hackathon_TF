# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. Can I have your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, uh, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm pulling that up now. And who am I speaking with today?

Customer: This is Tom. Tom Richardson.

Agent: Perfect, Tom. I see your account here. So what brings you in today? What can I help you with?

Customer: Yeah, so my internet's been down since this morning. I woke up and there's just... nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Oh man, that's frustrating. I'm sorry you're dealing with that. Let me see what I can do for you. First, can you tell me—are you getting any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Uh, let me go check. (pause) Yeah, okay, I'm looking at it. The modem has a red light on it. Like, completely red.

Agent: Okay, the red light—that typically indicates there's no connection coming in from our line. Have there been any storms in your area recently? Any weather issues?

Customer: No, actually it's been clear all day. Nothing unusual.

Agent: Alright, well let's try some basic troubleshooting. First thing I want you to do is unplug the modem from the power source.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Done.

Agent: Great. Just let it sit unplugged for about thirty seconds. While we're waiting, let me ask—have you had any work done at your house recently? Any construction or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine yesterday, and then this morning just... dead.

Agent: Right, that's helpful. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in device) Okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Perfect. So what we're looking at now—does that red light stay red, or is it changing at all?

Customer: (pause) It's still red. Maybe a little orange now, but mostly red.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Give it about a minute to fully boot up. Sometimes it takes a little while after a reset.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm watching it. Still red though.

Agent: Alright, I'm seeing here that we actually had some maintenance done in your area yesterday evening. It's possible there's still something being worked on that's affecting your line. But let me check a couple other things. Do you have a phone line running through that modem?

Customer: Yeah, I do. The internet and phone bundle.

Agent: Okay, and is the phone working?

Customer: Let me... (pause) No, actually. Phone's not working either. Both things are down.

Agent: Right, that makes sense if the connection's completely out. Let me pull up our service map here and see... (typing sounds) (pause) Are you located on Oakwood Drive?

Customer: Yeah, Oakwood. 447 Oakwood.

Agent: Perfect, I'm pulling that specific address. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm not seeing any active alerts or outages in your area at the moment. That said, the maintenance work we did yesterday... it's possible there's an issue with the line connection outside. Do you happen to know where your outside line comes in? Like, where the connection box is on your house?

Customer: Uh... I mean, I think it's on the side of the house? I'm not really sure, to be honest.

Agent: That's alright, that's alright. This might be something we need to send a technician out to look at. But before we do that, let me try one more thing. Can you check if your modem has a reset button? Usually it's a small pinhole button on the back.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, yeah, I see it. Do I... do I press it?

Agent: I want you to use something like a paperclip or a pen—don't use your finger—and hold that button in for about ten seconds. That'll do a full factory reset of the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (sounds of pressing button) ...it's doing something. The lights are all blinking now.

Agent: Good, good. That means it's rebooting. Let's give it about two minutes to fully restart and reconnect to the network.

Customer: (pause) Alright. I'm standing here watching it.

Agent: (pause) So Tom, just out of curiosity—this is your first issue with us since you've had the service, or have you had problems before?

Customer: No, this is the first thing. I've had it for, what, six months? And it's been working great until today.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. (pause) So how's it looking? Any changes to those lights?

Customer: (pause) Uh... no, still the same. Red light, a few amber lights blinking, but nothing... I mean, nothing that's connecting.

Agent: Alright. Unfortunately, that red light is telling us there's no signal coming in from the street. At this point, I think we're going to need to get a technician out there to check the line. It could be something external that got disrupted during that maintenance work.

Customer: Oh, man. How long does that usually take? I'm working from home, and I really need internet back.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me check what availability we have. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest we can get someone out is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? Yeah, I can do that. Is it going to cost anything?

Agent: Since you're under warranty and this appears to be a service issue on our end—especially given the maintenance work we had done—there should be no charge for the visit. We'll get this sorted out for you.

Customer: Okay, alright. Well, I guess that's... I guess that's the best you can do.

Agent: (pause) I wish I had better news for you right now. I know this is frustrating. Let me just confirm some information and get you scheduled. The address is 447 Oakwood Drive, correct?

Customer: Yep, that's right.

Agent: And the best phone number to reach you is the one we have on file, which should be [inaudible]?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell phone, so that'll work.

Agent: Perfect. So we have you scheduled for tomorrow, between 8 AM and noon. A technician will give you a call about 30 minutes before they arrive. Your confirmation number is 587429. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Tom?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. Just... hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident we'll get this resolved. If anything changes before the visit, you can always give us a call back. We're available 24/7.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome, Tom. We appreciate your patience, and we'll see you tomorrow. Take care!

Customer: Alright, bye.

Agent: Bye now!
