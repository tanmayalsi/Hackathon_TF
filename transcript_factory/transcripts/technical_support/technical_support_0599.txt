Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went down about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the router and everything, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm pulling up your account now. And just to confirm, I have Robert Martinez at 418 Elm Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So your internet service is down completely. Are you able to see any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, let me look. The modem has... okay, so the power light is on, but the internet light is off. And the router's the same way—power is on but everything else is dark.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The internet light being off typically means we're not detecting a connection coming into your modem. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for about thirty seconds? Just pull it from the wall outlet.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, doing it now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we wait, let me just check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to see if there are any outages in your area... No, I'm not showing any outages affecting your address. That's good news. Now go ahead and plug the modem back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged back in. (pause) The lights are coming back on... power light's solid... and... (longer pause) ...nope. Internet light's still not coming on.

Agent: Alright, give it just another moment. Sometimes it takes about a minute or two to fully boot up and establish that connection.

Customer: (pause) ...Still nothing. It's been like... thirty seconds since I plugged it back in and... no, the internet light's definitely not turning on.

Agent: Okay. Let me ask you this—are you looking at your modem right now? Is it a white box with the Frontier logo on it?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Perfect. And you mentioned you also have a router?

Customer: Right, yeah. It's separate. I got that with you guys too.

Agent: Got it. What I'd like you to do is leave the modem plugged in, and now unplug the router for me.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...unplugging it now.

Agent: And wait about thirty seconds again, then plug that back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, replugging the router... (pause) Power light's on. The Wi-Fi lights are... they're coming back. But still nothing on the internet side.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, so the router's powered up but still showing no internet connection. Let me check something. Is there a cable running from your modem to the wall? Like a coax cable?

Customer: Uh, yeah. I see it. It's the thick one, right?

Agent: That's the one. Can you make sure that's plugged in firmly? Sometimes these connections can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking at it now... it seems pretty tight, but let me... (sound of movement) ...let me push it in a bit more just to be sure.

Agent: Good idea.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I pushed it in. But I'm still not seeing... the internet light's still not coming on on the modem.

Agent: Alright. And when did you first notice the internet went out? Did anything happen before that? A storm, power outage, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I was just... I was watching something online and then it just... cut out. No warning or anything.

Agent: Okay. Let me try something else. Can you check the cables on the back of your modem? There should be the coax cable we just talked about, and then there's usually an ethernet cable that runs to your router. Can you see if that ethernet cable is plugged in all the way?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. Let me trace it... it goes from the modem to the router. Seems plugged in on both ends.

Agent: Good. Let me have you try one more thing. I'm going to have you do what we call a factory reset on the modem. What I need you to do is locate a small button—it's usually recessed—on the back or bottom of the modem. It might be labeled "Reset."

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking... I see a button back here. It's pretty small.

Agent: That's the one. Now, I need you to hold that button down for about ten seconds while the modem is powered on. It's going to restart the whole modem.

Customer: Okay... I'm pressing it now. (pause) How long do I hold it?

Agent: About ten seconds. Just count it out.

Customer: (pause) Okay... ten seconds... and I'm releasing it now. (pause) The lights are going out... and now they're coming back on. The modem's rebooting.

Agent: Good. Give it about another minute or two to fully restart and try to connect to our network.

Customer: (pause, waiting) Okay, it's been a minute... The power light's definitely on... (longer pause) ...but the internet light is still not coming on. I'm not seeing any change.

Agent: Okay, I hear you. That's frustrating. Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at the modem's connection status in our system, and I'm not showing any active connection coming from your modem's MAC address. That suggests the issue might be with the modem itself or the line coming into your house.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It might be the modem, or it could be an issue with the line running to your address. I'm going to be honest with you—based on everything we've tried, I'm not able to troubleshoot this further over the phone. What I'd like to do is get a technician scheduled to come out to your place and take a look at the physical connections and test the line.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) Okay, so the earliest we have available is... tomorrow afternoon between two and four PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) I guess so. I don't really have a choice, do I?

Agent: I know it's not ideal. Our technician will be able to diagnose whether it's the modem, the line, or something else once they get there. In the meantime, if you want to try anything, you can make sure all the connections are as tight as possible, but I don't want you doing anything that might cause more issues.

Customer: Yeah, okay. So what's my appointment time?

Agent: (typing sounds) I'm going to schedule you for tomorrow, Tuesday the 14th, between 2 and 4 PM. The technician will call you fifteen minutes before arrival. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to email you a confirmation to the address we have on file. Is [inaudible] still current?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just... I really hope you guys can figure this out tomorrow.

Agent: I understand completely. I'm confident our technician will be able to identify what's going on. Thanks for being patient with me today, Robert, and sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone.

Customer: Yeah, no problem. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: You're welcome. You have a great day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
