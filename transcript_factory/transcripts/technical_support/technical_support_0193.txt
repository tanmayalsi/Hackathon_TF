# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I've got work stuff I need to do and I'm just... I'm pretty frustrated right now.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you're experiencing that. I'll do everything I can to help get this resolved for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: Great, Michael. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Okay, I see you've been a Frontier customer for about three years. So when you say your internet went down this morning, did you notice anything else? Like did you lose power, or did something happen before it stopped working?

Customer: No, the power's fine. Everything else in my house is working. I just woke up and tried to check my email and nothing. The router lights are on and everything looks normal, but there's just no internet connection.

Agent: Alright. So the equipment lights are on, which is a good sign. Let me walk you through a couple quick troubleshooting steps, okay?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Whatever you need.

Agent: First, can you tell me which model router you have? You should see a sticker on the top or back of it. It'll say something like FR-something or maybe a brand name.

Customer: (pause) Um, let me find it. (background noise) Okay, I'm looking at it now. It says "FR-1200."

Agent: Perfect. The FR-1200, great. So I'd like you to do a power cycle. That's just going to be pulling the power cable from the back of the router, waiting about thirty seconds, and then plugging it back in. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. I'm waiting... (pause) ...alright, thirty seconds is up. Plugging it back in now. (pause) The lights are coming back on. Should I wait for them to stabilize?

Agent: Yes, definitely. Give it about two to three minutes for everything to boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm waiting. (longer pause) Alright, the lights look the same as before. All solid. But I'm still not getting anything on my laptop. No internet.

Agent: Okay, let's try a couple other things. Can you try connecting with an ethernet cable? If you have a computer near the router, that would help us figure out if it's a WiFi issue or something else.

Customer: I don't have an ethernet cable handy, but... wait, I can probably find one. Hold on. (background noise) Okay, I found one. I'm plugging in my laptop now.

Agent: Great. Let me know once it's connected.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's connected. The cable's in. But... still nothing. I'm not seeing any internet connection at all.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, that tells me it's not just a WiFi issue. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Michael, I'm looking at your account, and I'm not seeing any outages in your area at the moment. But I do see that your modem might be having trouble connecting to our network. Can you check the lights on your modem? That would be separate from the router—it might be in the same box or nearby. Is there a power light and maybe an internet light?

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) I think I might only have the one device. It's all in one unit. There's just the router.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. Some of our newer customers do have a combo unit. In that case, can you look at the lights and tell me if there's one that's red or maybe amber colored?

Customer: (pause) No, they all look... they all look green to me. They're all solid green.

Agent: All green is actually a good thing. That usually means the device is working properly. But let me try one more thing. I'm going to have you restart your modem and router completely. This time, I want you to hold the reset button on the back of the unit for ten seconds.

Customer: Oh, no. That's going to... won't that erase everything?

Agent: No, don't worry. As long as you just hold it for ten seconds, it should just do a soft reset. You shouldn't lose any of your settings. If I ask you to hold it for thirty seconds, then we'd be doing a full factory reset. But ten seconds should be fine.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see the reset button. I'm holding it. (pause) One... two... three... (pause) Okay, I'm letting go. I can see the lights going off now. Should I wait again?

Agent: Yes, give it about three minutes again.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... lights are back on. (pause) Still not working though. No internet on my laptop.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm seeing... I'm seeing something here in the notes on your account. (typing sounds) Michael, when was the last time you updated your router firmware?

Customer: I don't... I'm not sure what that is, to be honest with you.

Agent: That's totally fine. It's just the software that runs the router. Usually it updates automatically, but sometimes there can be issues. Let me try something else. Can you unplug the device one more time for me? But this time, leave it unplugged for a full five minutes.

Customer: Five minutes? Okay... (pause) It's unplugged. I'll just wait here. (long pause) (background noise of customer moving around) Okay, so... about five minutes should be up now. I'm plugging it back in.

Agent: Alright.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged in. Lights are coming on again. (pause) No internet still.

Agent: (pause) Okay, Michael. I've gone through several troubleshooting steps with you, and unfortunately I'm not seeing improvement. At this point, I want to make sure we don't have a hardware issue with your modem. I think we're going to need to either get a replacement device sent out to you or have a technician come to your home to check things out.

Customer: Are you kidding? Like, how long would that take?

Agent: Well, I can schedule a technician visit for you. The soonest availability I'm seeing is... (typing sounds) ...it looks like we have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we could do Thursday afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need this working today. Is there anything else we can try?

Agent: I understand the urgency. I've walked through the standard troubleshooting steps, and based on what we're seeing, I don't want to have you keep trying things that might not help. The most reliable next step would be the technician visit. They'll be able to test the line directly and see if there's an issue with the equipment or potentially something on our end that's affecting your connection.

Customer: (frustrated pause) Fine. Tomorrow morning is better than Thursday. What time tomorrow?

Agent: Perfect. Let me get you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. I'm going to confirm that appointment now... (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, Michael, you're all set for tomorrow. A technician will arrive at your home between 8 AM and noon. You'll get a courtesy call about thirty minutes before they arrive. The confirmation number is FR-227-549-84.

Customer: Okay. And they'll be able to fix it?

Agent: They'll definitely diagnose what's happening and either repair it on site or get you a replacement device as quickly as possible. 

Customer: Alright. Thank you, I guess. This is just... it's frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, Michael. Thank you for being patient with me today. Your technician appointment is tomorrow morning, confirmation number FR-227-549-84. If you have any other questions, you can always reach out to Frontier. Have a great day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
