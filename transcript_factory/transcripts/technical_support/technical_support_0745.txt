Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went down this morning and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And your name is...?

Customer: James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Do you remember what time that happened?

Customer: Uh, probably around eight o'clock? I went to check my email and nothing was loading. The whole thing's just dead.

Agent: Okay, and are you able to see any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Let me go look. (pause) Yeah, so the modem has a... there's a red light. Just a red light on it. The router's over there but I don't think it has any lights on at all.

Agent: Alright, a red light on the modem usually means there's no connection. That's what we're gonna focus on. The router being dark is probably because it's not getting any signal from the modem. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just take the power cable out.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While that's sitting there, let's also unplug the router. Just pull the power out of that as well.

Customer: Yep, that's unplugged too. How long do I wait?

Agent: Give it about thirty seconds. Just let everything sit there and discharge. (pause) While we're waiting, have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, this is... I mean, I've had the service for like two years and it's been pretty solid. Never had a problem before. Just woke up today and it's gone.

Agent: Okay, good to know. That's helpful information. Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, it's powered on. I'm watching it boot up.

Agent: Perfect. What lights are you seeing now?

Customer: Um... I'm still seeing red. Just red. Maybe it's still booting up?

Agent: It might be. Give it another thirty seconds or so to fully power on. Sometimes it takes a minute for the modem to establish a connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Still red though. That's not good, right?

Agent: Let's not worry yet. Go ahead and plug the router back in while we let that modem continue to boot.

Customer: Alright. (pause) Router's plugged back in.

Agent: Good. Now, I'm actually looking at your account and I'm not showing any outages reported in your area, so that's a positive sign. Can you tell me... do you have a Frontier-provided modem, or do you have your own equipment?

Customer: It's the one you guys gave me. It came with the service.

Agent: Okay, perfect. And you haven't moved it or changed anything recently?

Customer: No, no. It's been sitting in the same spot since day one.

Agent: Alright. So the modem should be fully powered up by now. You're still seeing just a red light?

Customer: Yeah, just red. Nothing else. And the router is still dark.

Agent: Okay. Let me check a couple of things on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) James, I'm checking our systems and I'm not seeing any service disruptions on your line. Can you actually walk over to the modem for me and take a look at the cables? I want to make sure both cables are firmly connected.

Customer: Which cables? There's a couple plugged in back there.

Agent: Right, so there should be two main cables. One is the power cable, which you already know about. The other one should be your service line—it comes from your wall outlet. It's usually a coaxial cable. Looks kind of like a thick TV cable. Can you check if that one's securely plugged in?

Customer: (pause) Oh, um... hold on. I'm looking... (pause) Okay, I see it. It looks pretty loose actually. Let me... (pause) I'm tightening it now.

Agent: Great, push it in nice and firm until you feel it click.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I think I got it. (pause) Oh! Oh, actually... I'm seeing some lights changing on the modem now. There's like a green light and a... yeah, okay, I think it's working!

Agent: Excellent! That's great news. What colors are you seeing now?

Customer: I'm seeing green and then there's like an orange light that's blinking. Is that normal?

Agent: The blinking orange or amber light usually means the modem is trying to connect or it's downloading a firmware update. That should settle down in just a moment. Give it another minute or so.

Customer: Okay, I'm watching it. (pause) Still blinking... (pause) Okay, now it looks like both lights are solid green!

Agent: Perfect! That's exactly what we want to see. Now let me check your router. Are you seeing any lights on that now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah! Yeah, I see lights now. There's like green lights on it.

Agent: Wonderful. Go ahead and try opening a browser on your computer or phone and see if you can get online.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me grab my laptop. (pause) Alright, opening Chrome... (pause) Hmm.

Agent: What's happening?

Customer: It's... it's loading. (pause) Loading... (pause) Oh no, it stopped. It says "can't reach this server."

Agent: Okay, don't worry. Sometimes it takes a minute for everything to sync up properly. Let me have you do one more power cycle, but this time a bit differently. I want you to unplug just the modem this time, but leave the router plugged in.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Modem's unplugged.

Agent: Wait about forty-five seconds.

Customer: (pause) Still waiting... (pause) Okay, should be good now.

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugged back in. (pause) Okay, the lights are coming back. (pause) I've got the green lights again, both of them.

Agent: Good. Now try that browser again.

Customer: (pause) Alright, opening Chrome again... (typing sounds) (pause) Come on... (pause) It's still saying... no, wait. (pause) It's still not connecting. It's the same error.

Agent: Hmm. Let me take a closer look at your account here. (typing sounds) (long pause) James, I'm looking at the modem's connection status on my end and I'm actually not seeing your modem registering with our network. That's... that's unusual.

Customer: What does that mean? So it's like a signal problem?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be an issue with the line coming into your house, or it could be a problem with the modem itself. Do you happen to know when was the last time your internet was definitely working?

Customer: Yesterday afternoon. I was checking stuff on my laptop yesterday around three o'clock and it was fine. Then this morning it just wasn't there.

Agent: Okay. And you didn't notice any storms last night or anything unusual?

Customer: No, it was pretty clear. No storms or anything.

Agent: Alright. What I'd like to do is schedule a technician to come out and check your external lines and take a look at the modem. There might be an issue with the line itself that we need to investigate in person. Would you be available for a technician visit?

Customer: Uh... I mean, yeah, I guess. When would that be?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. It looks like we could get someone out to you tomorrow between one and five PM, or we have a slot on Friday morning between nine and noon.

Customer: Tomorrow would work. What's your address so I can confirm?

Customer: It's 847 Maple Street, apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. So I have you down for a technician visit tomorrow, one to five PM window. You should receive a confirmation text at the number on your account within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow because I work from home and I kind of need the internet.

Agent: I completely understand, James. Our technician will do their best to get you back online as quickly as possible. If you have any other issues before tomorrow or if you need to reschedule, just give us a call back at the number on your bill. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks for trying, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Sorry we couldn't get it resolved over the phone, but we'll get it sorted out tomorrow. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
