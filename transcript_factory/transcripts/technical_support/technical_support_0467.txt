# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I can't figure out what's wrong with it. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. One second... Alright, I've got your account here. The service address is 2841 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Like, do you have any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um, let me look... The modem's in the other room. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. There's... there's a red light on it. The power light is red, I think? And then there's nothing else really lit up.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is red. That's actually a good sign—it means it's getting power. But red usually means there's no internet connection coming in. Have you tried unplugging the modem yet today?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, let's do a hard reset. Go ahead and unplug the modem from the wall outlet. Wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. Let me know once you've done that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now... (sounds of movement) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just count to thirty in your head, or we can just chat while we wait. How long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, um, about two years now. It's usually pretty reliable, but yeah, today just out of nowhere it stopped working.

Agent: Got it. We definitely want to get this resolved for you. (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in device) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now, we just need to give it a minute or two to fully boot up. While that's happening, can you tell me—did anything change recently? Like, did you have a storm, or did you install any new equipment?

Customer: No, no. It was fine last night when I went to bed. This morning I got up, tried to use it, and just... nothing.

Agent: Okay. And are you seeing any change in those lights now?

Customer: (pause) Um... the red light is still there. It's not green yet.

Agent: Alright, give it another fifteen seconds or so. Sometimes these take a minute to fully come back online.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, okay... still waiting... (pause) Okay, now it's... it looks like it's flickering between red and green?

Agent: Okay, that's progress! It's trying to establish a connection. While it's doing that, let me ask—do you have a ONT unit? It's a small white box, usually mounted on a wall, either inside or outside your home.

Customer: A ONT? Um... I don't think so? Or maybe I do and I don't know what it looks like?

Agent: (chuckles) No worries, that happens. It's a small white box about the size of a shoebox. It might be in your garage, on an exterior wall, or near where your cable comes in.

Customer: (pause) Oh! Yeah, I think I see it. It's on the wall outside. There's a white box out there.

Agent: Perfect! Can you go take a look at it? We're gonna want to check the lights on that as well.

Customer: Sure, one second. (sounds of walking, door opening) (background noise—wind) Okay, I'm looking at it. So there's... there's some lights on it. What am I looking for?

Agent: Good question. You should see lights on the front of it. Can you tell me what colors they are and whether they're solid or blinking?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so there's like a green light, that one's solid. And then there's an orange light, and that one's blinking. And I think there's a red one?

Agent: Alright. The blinking orange light is what concerns me a bit. That typically indicates either a problem with the line connection or an issue with the ONT itself. Let me check a few things from my end. (typing sounds) Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure, no problem.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any outages in your area, so that's good news. But I am seeing that the ONT might be having trouble syncing with our network. Have you noticed any physical damage to the ONT or any of the cables connected to it? Like, is anything loose or damaged?

Customer: (pause) No, everything looks okay from what I can see. The cables all seem pretty secure.

Agent: Alright. Let's try a reset on the ONT as well. There should be a small reset button on the back of the unit. It might be recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something thin to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking on the back... I see a little button here. Do I just press it?

Agent: You'll want to press and hold it for about ten seconds. That'll do a hard reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... ten seconds... (pause) ...and release. Okay, I did it.

Agent: Great! Now let's head back inside and check the modem again. Give the ONT about a minute to reboot.

Customer: (sounds of door closing, footsteps) (pause) Okay, I'm back at the modem.

Agent: Alright. What are we seeing now on the modem lights?

Customer: (pause) Still... still red. It's not blinking anymore, but it's just solid red. That doesn't seem good.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, unfortunately... let me check something here. (typing sounds) Hmm. I'm not seeing any provisioning from the ONT on our end. This is unusual. Usually after a reset, we see it pop back up within a few minutes. 

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: It means the ONT isn't successfully connecting to our network. This could be a few different things—it could be a bad ONT, there could be a line issue, or possibly an issue on our network side that we're not seeing yet. Have you had any work done recently by Frontier? Any installations or line maintenance?

Customer: Not that I know of, no.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Unfortunately, what I'm seeing here is beyond what we can typically troubleshoot over the phone. I think what we need to do is get a technician out to your location to check the line and possibly replace the ONT. 

Customer: Oh, really? How long would that take? I need my internet—I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) I can get someone out there tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have a later window at 4 to 8 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. 

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, I have a technician appointment set for tomorrow, June 15th, between 8 AM and 12 PM at your address, 2841 Maple Street. You should get a confirmation text and email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I really hope they can fix it quickly. I have meetings tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand. Our technician will do their best. If you have any issues or need to reschedule, you can call us back. In the meantime, is there anything else?

Customer: No, that should be it. Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome! We appreciate your patience, and sorry again for the trouble. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
