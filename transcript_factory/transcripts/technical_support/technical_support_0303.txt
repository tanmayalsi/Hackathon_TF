# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I work from home and I've got meetings coming up.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get your phone number or account number to look things up?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. So your internet is completely down? Let me ask you a few quick questions. First, is your modem powered on?

Customer: Yes, it's... actually, I see one of the lights is off. Should all the lights be on?

Agent: Okay, which light is off? Can you tell me what color lights you're seeing?

Customer: Um... I see green and then there's like a blue light, and... I think there's a red light that's not lit up. Or wait, maybe it was never lit up. I'm not really... (pause) I don't know what's normal.

Agent: That's totally fine. So you should see a solid green light, that indicates power. The red light usually means either no connection or an error. The blue one is your internet connection. So if that's off, that would explain why you're not getting internet. Let's try the easiest fix first. Can you unplug the modem for me?

Customer: Unplug it?

Agent: Yeah, just pull the power cord out. Hold it for about thirty seconds, then plug it back in. That's usually the quickest way to get things working again.

Customer: Oh, okay. (pause) I'm doing that now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: And just wait... (pause) yeah, about thirty seconds should do it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, thirty seconds are up. Plugging it back in now. (pause) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait for it to fully boot up. That usually takes a minute or two. Can you watch those lights for me? Tell me when they stabilize.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the green light came back on, the blue one is... kind of blinking now? (pause) It's still blinking.

Agent: Okay, so blinking is actually fine. That means it's trying to connect. Give it another minute or so. Sometimes it takes a second to reestablish the connection.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, still blinking. (pause) Okay, now it's... still blinking, actually. Hmm.

Agent: Still blinking after like two minutes?

Customer: Yeah. How long should it take?

Agent: It should really be solid by now. Um, okay, let me ask you something else. Do you see any cables plugged into the back of the modem? Like, is your coax cable connected?

Customer: My coax cable? (pause) I... I'm not sure what that looks like. There's definitely cables back there but I don't know which one is which.

Agent: Okay, it's the thicker cable, kind of looks like a TV cable. It's usually screwed in at the back of the modem.

Customer: Oh! Yeah, I see it. It's plugged in. Well, screwed in, like you said.

Agent: Good, good. That's correct. And you've got an ethernet cable going to your computer or your router?

Customer: I have a... wait, I think I have a router. Yeah, it's the bigger box next to the modem.

Agent: Okay, so you've got a router. Is that powered on?

Customer: (pause) Let me check. Yeah, I see lights on it too. They're... mostly green with like a yellow one.

Agent: And the internet light on the router, is that one lit up?

Customer: (pause) I'm not sure which one is the internet light. There are like four or five different lights.

Agent: [inaudible] Okay, um, usually it's labeled. Can you look at the top of the router and see if any of them say like "internet" or "WAN"?

Customer: (pause) Let me see... I see "power," there's one that says "internet," and then... yeah. The internet one is not lit up at all.

Agent: Okay, so that's definitely the issue then. The router is not seeing an internet signal coming from the modem. Let me try something. Can you unplug the router as well?

Customer: The router too?

Agent: Yeah. Same thing, thirty seconds, then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Thirty seconds... (pause) plugging it back in.

Agent: Alright, let's give that another minute to reconnect.

Customer: (pause) Okay. (pause) So the modem blue light is still blinking, but now the router is starting up too. (pause) Hmm. Still nothing on the internet light.

Agent: Still blinking on the modem?

Customer: Yeah.

Agent: Okay, that's... (pause) that's not ideal. Um, let me check if there's anything on my end that might be causing this. Can you give me one second?

Customer: Sure, yeah.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, then agent returns) Okay, I'm back. So I'm not showing any outages in your area, and your modem is showing as online here on my system, which is strange because you're saying the internet light isn't solid.

Customer: So the modem is online but I can't connect?

Agent: Right, so on my end it looks connected, but your equipment isn't showing that. This could be a line issue or possibly something with the modem itself. Um, let me try one more thing. When the modem is fully powered up, can you check the back and see if there's a reset button?

Customer: A reset button? (pause) I don't think I see one. It's pretty small.

Agent: It might be recessed, like you'd need a paperclip to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I'm looking... I don't think there's one. Or if there is, I'm not seeing it.

Agent: That's alright. At this point, I think we might be dealing with a hardware issue or possibly a line problem that I can't diagnose from here. Usually when the modem shows online on our system but you're not getting signal through the router, it's one of those two things.

Customer: So what does that mean? How do I fix it?

Agent: Well, we have a couple options. I can schedule a technician to come out and check the line and your equipment. They'd typically be able to come out tomorrow or the next day, depending on availability in your area.

Customer: Tomorrow? I need internet today.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) Okay, so we do have some same-day appointments, but they're pretty limited. Let me check what we've got. (pause) The earliest I'm seeing for a technician visit is around 4 PM this evening. Would that work for you?

Customer: 4 PM? That's... I guess that could work. I'll have to rearrange some things, but yeah, I need to get this fixed.

Agent: Okay, great. Let me get you scheduled for that. That'll be for service call for a modem and connection issue. The technician will come out and test the line and check your equipment. If it's a hardware issue, they can potentially replace the modem on the spot.

Customer: Okay, so they'll fix it today?

Agent: They should be able to diagnose it and fix it if it's something simple, yes. In case it's a line issue that needs to be checked outside, that might take a bit longer, but they'll get you taken care of.

Customer: Alright, okay. Um, and I'll get a confirmation or something?

Agent: Absolutely. You'll get a text and email confirmation with the technician's name and the time window. It should come through within the next few minutes. The window is generally four hours, so they could arrive anytime between 4 and 8 PM, but hopefully earlier than that.

Customer: Okay. Alright, I guess that's better than nothing. Thanks for trying to help troubleshoot it.

Agent: Of course. I wish we could have gotten it working over the phone, but I'm confident our technician will be able to get you back online today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Well, hopefully the technician can fix it. (pause) Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we apologize for the inconvenience today. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
