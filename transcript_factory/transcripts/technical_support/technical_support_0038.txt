# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and... I don't know, I'm not really tech savvy, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Don't worry, we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get your name?

Customer: It's David. David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I see your account here. It looks like you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. Like, it was working fine this morning, and then when I went to check something around noon, nothing. The lights on my router are all off, which is weird.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Let me ask you a few questions. Can you tell me what color the lights are on your modem and router right now?

Customer: They're... they're all off. Like completely dark. Both of them.

Agent: All right. And are they plugged in? Sometimes these things can get unplugged accidentally.

Customer: (slight laugh) Yeah, I checked that first. They're both plugged in. I can see the cables going in.

Agent: Good. Let me have you try something for me. Can you unplug the modem first? The device that connects directly to the wall outlet.

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now leave that unplugged for about 30 seconds while you count. Just give me a heads up when you're ready to plug it back in.

Customer: Okay... (long pause) All right, 30 seconds is up.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, it's in.

Agent: Excellent. Now let's give it about a minute to boot up. While that's happening, can you tell me if you've had any recent storms or bad weather in your area?

Customer: Um, no, not that I've seen. It's been pretty clear actually.

Agent: All right. (pause) How are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Uh... still nothing. Still completely dark.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try something else. Can you check the back of the modem? There should be a small reset button. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... yeah, I think I see it. It's like, really tiny, right?

Agent: That's the one. We're going to do a factory reset. I want you to hold that button down for about 10 seconds with something like a paperclip or a pen.

Customer: Oh, okay. (pause) All right, I'm pressing it. (pause) Been about 10 seconds... (pause) I'm letting go.

Agent: Good. Let's wait another minute or so and see if we get any lights.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. This is so frustrating.

Agent: I know, I hear you. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm looking at our network map, and I'm not showing any outages in your area currently. However, let me run a line test to see if we're getting any signal to your address.

Customer: Okay, what does that mean if there's no signal?

Agent: Well, it could mean a few things. It could be an issue with the connection coming into your house, or it could be something more serious with our network infrastructure. Let me run that test for you real quick.

Customer: (pause) How long does that take?

Agent: Just a moment. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay... so interestingly, I'm not getting a clean signal from your line. That's concerning. Can you tell me, do you see any damage to the cable that comes into your home? Like if you look outside where it enters the wall?

Customer: (pause) I... I'm not really sure where that is. The cable comes in somewhere, but I don't know exactly where.

Agent: That's all right. Does your house have a gray box on the exterior wall, or maybe a small panel?

Customer: Maybe? I don't think so. We have a townhouse, if that helps.

Agent: All right, that does help. For townhouses, the connection usually comes in near the foundation or around the back. But no worries if you're not comfortable checking that right now. Let me try one more thing here. Let me reboot your router as well.

Customer: The one that's the wireless thing, right?

Agent: Exactly. Just unplug it, wait about 30 seconds, and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) All right, unplugging. (long pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause)

Agent: Good. Let's give this a minute to come back online.

Customer: (pause) How's it looking from your end?

Agent: I'm still not seeing any signal coming through. I'm going to be honest with you, David—I think this might be something beyond a simple troubleshoot. The fact that we're not detecting any line signal tells me there could be a break in the cable somewhere between our network and your home.

Customer: Oh no. So what does that mean? How long until someone can come fix it?

Agent: Well, I would absolutely like to send a technician out to your location. That's going to be your best option at this point. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) We can get someone out to you tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? There's nothing sooner? Like today?

Agent: Unfortunately, today's route is pretty booked up, but I can put you on a priority callback list in case we have a cancellation. But I can't guarantee anything before end of business today.

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, okay. Tomorrow morning works, I guess. Just... this really sucks, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. I hate that we're dealing with this. Let me get you set up for that appointment. I just need to confirm your address. I have 447 Maple Ridge Court?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And a callback number to confirm with you?

Customer: 555-0147, same as my account number.

Agent: Excellent. I'm going to get this appointment on the books for you tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM window. A technician will come out and assess what's happening with your line connection. Depending on what they find, it could be anything from a loose connection to damaged cabling.

Customer: So they'll probably be able to fix it while they're there?

Agent: Most likely, yes. It really just depends on what the issue is. But if it's something significant, they might need to order parts or coordinate with our line department, but they'll let you know when they arrive.

Customer: Okay. Well, I guess I'll see them tomorrow then.

Agent: Absolutely. And David, I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved today. I know how inconvenient this is. Is there anything else I can help you with on the phone right now?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully tomorrow fixes it.

Agent: I really hope so too. Thanks for your patience with us today. Your appointment is all set for tomorrow morning. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus. Bye.

Agent: Bye, David. Take care.
