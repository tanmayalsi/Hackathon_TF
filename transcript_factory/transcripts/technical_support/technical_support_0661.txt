# Frontier Communications - Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... my internet has been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you tried unplugging your router and modem yet?

Customer: Yeah, I did that like an hour ago. I unplugged everything for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in.

Agent: Good, good. And what's happening right now? Are you not seeing any lights on the modem, or...?

Customer: Well, the modem has lights, but they're not... I don't know, they don't look right. Usually there's like a green light on top, but right now it's just blinking red. And the router isn't doing anything either.

Agent: Okay, so the modem's showing a red light. That typically indicates either a connection issue or a problem with the modem itself. Can you tell me what model modem you have? It should be on a label on the front or back.

Customer: (pause) Uh, let me grab it... it says Frontier Quantum Gateway. Is that... is that the normal one?

Agent: Yes, that's one of our standard modems. Alright, James, I'm going to walk you through a couple of things here. First, can you check the cables for me? Is the coaxial cable—that's the thick cable that connects to the wall—is that plugged in securely?

Customer: (rustling sounds) Yeah, it's plugged in. I'm looking at it right now.

Agent: Okay, and it's nice and tight? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: Seems tight to me.

Agent: Alright. And do you see the ethernet cable that goes from the modem to your computer or router?

Customer: Oh, well, it's the router. I have a separate router. And yeah, that cable is plugged in.

Agent: Got it. Okay, so let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your connection here and... hmm, it looks like we're not seeing an active connection from your location at all. That's interesting. When did this start exactly?

Customer: Like, I woke up this morning around seven and went to check my email and nothing was loading. I've been dealing with this for a few hours now. I work from home, so this is... it's pretty frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see here... (pause) Okay, I'm going to try something. I'm going to power cycle your modem from my end. This should take about thirty seconds. Can you watch the lights on your modem and tell me what happens?

Customer: Okay, yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

Agent: (pause) Alright, powering it down... and... now. Watch and tell me when you see the lights change.

Customer: Um... okay, all the lights went out. (pause) Now they're coming back on. The red light is back though. Still blinking red.

Agent: Still blinking red? (pause) Okay. James, I'm going to be honest with you—that's not a good sign. That usually means either there's an issue with the signal coming into your home, or there's a problem with the modem itself. Have you had any storms in your area lately? Any weather issues?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear all week, actually.

Agent: Alright. Let me try a hard reset on the modem. Now, this will erase your settings, so we'll need to set it back up, but let's see if that helps. Do you see a small reset button on the modem? It might be recessed in a little hole.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. Do I need like a paperclip or something?

Agent: Exactly. Go ahead and use a paperclip or a pen to hold it down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, holding it... (pause) ...and releasing. Alright, the lights are going crazy now.

Agent: That's normal. Let's give it about two minutes to fully boot back up. While we're waiting, James, do you have any outages reported in your area? Have your neighbors mentioned anything?

Customer: Uh, I haven't talked to my neighbors about it, but... you know, I didn't think to check that.

Agent: That's okay. (typing sounds) Let me check our system... I'm not seeing any active outages reported in your area, which is good news and bad news. The good news is it's probably not a widespread thing. But the bad news is it might be specific to your line or your equipment. What's the light situation now?

Customer: Still the same. Red light, blinking. And like nothing else is really lighting up either.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I'm going to be up front with you. Based on what I'm seeing on my end and what you're describing, I think we might have an issue with either the connection line coming into your home or possibly the modem itself has failed. I can definitely schedule a technician to come out and take a look at your setup and the line.

Customer: How long would that take? When can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our schedule. (typing sounds) What does your availability look like? Are you home most days?

Customer: Well, I work from home, so yeah, I'm here. But I really need this fixed soon. Is there anything else we can try?

Agent: That's the thing—we've tried the standard troubleshooting steps and we're not getting any response. At this point, I think we really need someone to physically inspect your equipment and your line. But I totally understand the urgency. Let me see what I can do on the schedule.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm showing availability for tomorrow between one and four PM, or the day after that in the morning. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be better.

Agent: Perfect. So I've got you down for tomorrow, January fifteenth, between one and four PM. The technician will come out and inspect your modem, your connection, and the line itself. Is that the address on your account?

Customer: Yes, that should be right.

Agent: Great. (typing sounds) And they'll give you a call about thirty minutes before they arrive. In the meantime, there isn't much else I can try from my end. But just to cover all the bases, you could try unplugging everything one more time tonight and leaving it unplugged for a full minute, then plug it back in.

Customer: Okay, I can do that.

Agent: And if by some chance your internet comes back on before the technician arrives, just give us a call and we can cancel the appointment. But I'm not expecting that to happen based on what we're seeing. Is there anything else I can help you with today, James?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I understand. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working right now, but our technician will get to the bottom of it. You should be back online soon. Thanks for being patient with us, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Alright, thanks. I guess I'll talk to you if I need to reschedule or something.

Agent: Absolutely. Have a good day, James.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
