Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I can't figure out what's going on. I work from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up here... and I'm seeing an account under the name James Patterson. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Um, let me check. (pause) Yeah, so the modem has a red light on it. Like, it's not the usual green or whatever. And the router... I don't see any lights on the router at all, actually.

Agent: Okay, so the red light on the modem typically indicates there's an issue with the connection. That's helpful. Can you do me a favor and unplug the modem for about 30 seconds? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Sure thing. (pause) Yeah, unplugged it now.

Agent: Great. Let's just let it sit for about 30 seconds while we talk. So this just started happening this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, I was working and then around 9 AM everything just... stopped. No warning or anything. I tried restarting everything myself but nothing worked.

Agent: Gotcha. And you're not seeing any error messages or anything like that?

Customer: No, it's just... nothing. The internet's just not connecting. My phone won't connect to the WiFi, the computer's got no connection... nothing.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: (pause) Give it about a minute to boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me—have there been any recent storms or anything that might've affected your area?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear out. Why, is that usually an issue?

Agent: It can be, yeah. Sometimes weather can affect the lines, but it sounds like that's not the case here. (pause) Okay, what are you seeing on the modem now?

Customer: Um, still red. Just the red light.

Agent: Still red, okay. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area, so it's likely something specific to your connection. Have you checked the cables connected to the modem? Sometimes they can get loose.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking at it now... everything looks pretty tight to me. There's two cables going into it, right? One from the wall and one to my router?

Agent: Correct, yes. So you've got the coaxial cable coming from the wall and then the ethernet cable to your router. Those both look secure?

Customer: Yeah, they're both in there pretty good.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else. I'm going to check the signal levels on your modem. (typing sounds) Hmm... okay, so the signal coming into your modem is actually reading as extremely weak. That could be the issue.

Customer: What does that mean? Is something broken?

Agent: Well, it could mean a few things. There could be an issue with the line coming into your house, or there could be a problem at the node in your neighborhood. It's hard to say without being there. Let me try restarting the modem from my end here and see if that helps restore the signal.

Customer: Okay, go for it.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, I've initiated the restart. That can take a couple of minutes, so just give it a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay...

Agent: While that's happening, do you have a second device you could try connecting to the WiFi? Just to rule out an issue with one of your devices?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my phone. (pause) Okay, I'm trying to connect to the WiFi now... (pause) No, it's not even showing up. Like, the network isn't even broadcasting, I think.

Agent: Okay, so the WiFi network isn't appearing at all?

Customer: Right, it's not there. And before all this happened, everything was working fine. This just started today.

Agent: Right, I understand. (pause) Give me just one more second here... (typing sounds) Okay, the modem is still showing that weak signal, so I'm... I'm not getting that restart to complete properly. Let me try a different approach. Can you physically hold down the reset button on the back of the modem for about 10 seconds?

Customer: (pause) Oh, I really don't want to do a factory reset. Do I have to? That's going to erase everything, isn't it?

Agent: It's not ideal, I know, but at this point we're not getting any signal from the line itself. Let me... (pause) actually, you know what, let me first try to send a signal refresh to your modem. That shouldn't reset anything. Let me do that. (typing sounds)

Customer: (pause) Okay, I appreciate that. Trying not to mess with things I don't have to.

Agent: I totally get it. (pause) Alright, I've sent the refresh command. Are you seeing any change in the modem lights at this point?

Customer: (pause) Hmm... no. Still red. I'm still not seeing the WiFi network either.

Agent: Okay. Unfortunately, that didn't work. At this point, I'm seeing that the signal isn't reaching your modem properly, which tells me the issue is likely outside your home—it could be on the line coming in from the street or at our equipment. Given that troubleshooting isn't getting us anywhere, I think we're going to need to send a technician out to your location.

Customer: Seriously? How long is that going to take? I really need to get this fixed today if possible.

Agent: Let me check our tech schedule for you. (pause, typing sounds) What's your availability like today?

Customer: Um, I can do anything after 2 PM, I guess.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I've got an opening from 2 to 4 PM this afternoon. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that should work. What's the cost going to be for this?

Agent: Well, since we've troubleshot this together and it appears to be an issue with our infrastructure rather than your equipment, there shouldn't be a service charge for the technician visit.

Customer: Oh, good. Okay, so someone will be here between 2 and 4?

Agent: Correct. I'll get that scheduled for you. Is the phone number 555-0147 still the best way to reach you if the technician needs to get in touch?

Customer: Yes, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. So to confirm, we have a technician coming out this afternoon, between 2 and 4 PM, to diagnose the issue with your internet connection. In the meantime, I'd recommend keeping your modem and router unplugged, and then plug them back in about an hour before the technician arrives.

Customer: Okay, I can do that. And there's nothing else I can try?

Agent: Unfortunately, with the signal levels as low as they are, I don't think troubleshooting on your end is going to resolve this one. The technician will be able to check the external lines and our equipment. They'll get you sorted out.

Customer: Alright, I guess I'll just wait then. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. The technician will be able to get to the root of the issue. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working remotely. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with the appointment details. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll get you back online soon.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a good day.
