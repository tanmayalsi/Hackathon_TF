Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it fixed. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here. And your name?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. When exactly did you first notice it wasn't working?

Customer: Uh, around 8 AM? I tried to open a video call for work and nothing was loading. I restarted my router and waited like twenty minutes but it's still not connecting.

Agent: Alright, so you've already done a restart. That's good. Let me ask you a few more questions. Are you seeing any lights on the modem or router right now? Like, are they powered on?

Customer: Yeah, they're both on. The lights are... let me see... the power light is green and, um, there's a blue light that's blinking on the modem.

Agent: Okay, so the power's good. That blue light that's blinking, is that the internet or connection light?

Customer: (pause) I'm not really sure. There's like, three lights on here. One's green, steady. One's blue and blinking. And then there's another one that's not lit up at all.

Agent: Got it. So the one that's not lit up, can you tell me where it is? Is it above or below the blinking blue one?

Customer: It's, uh... it's below. So green steady at the top, blue blinking in the middle, and then nothing at the bottom.

Agent: Perfect. That bottom one should be your internet light, and that's the issue. What I want you to do is unplug the modem from the power outlet for about thirty seconds. Just pull it out completely.

Customer: Okay, doing it now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now just count to thirty and then plug it back in.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: (typing sounds) Go ahead and let that boot back up. It should take about two to three minutes to fully restart.

Customer: Alright, I'm waiting. (pause) Should I do anything else or just...?

Agent: Just give it a moment to boot up. While we're waiting, let me ask—have there been any storms in your area recently? Any weather issues?

Customer: No, not that I know of. It's been pretty clear all morning.

Agent: Okay, good. And you haven't made any changes to your setup recently? No one's unplugged anything or moved the modem around?

Customer: No, everything's been the same. My roommate didn't touch anything either.

Agent: Alright. So how's it looking now? Are you seeing that bottom light come on?

Customer: (pause) Um, not yet. Still just the green and the blue blinking. Give it another second... (longer pause) Nope. Still nothing on the bottom.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Let me try something else. Can you check the cable connection on the back of the modem? The main cable coming in from the wall? Just make sure it's plugged in snugly.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Yeah, it's... okay, I'm looking at it. It looks pretty tight already, but let me just... (sound of clicking) I'm pushing it in a bit more to make sure it's really secure.

Agent: Good. And while you're back there, is there any visible damage to the cable itself? Any cuts or anything?

Customer: (pause) No, it looks fine. It's a white cable and it seems okay to me.

Agent: Alright. Now, has your internet been working fine up until this morning?

Customer: Yeah, it's been good. Really fast, actually. No problems until today.

Agent: Okay. Let me check something on our end here. (typing sounds, longer pause) Give me just one moment...

Customer: (background noise - sound of papers rustling) No rush.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any outages in your area or anything on our network side. But I am seeing that your modem went offline about nine hours ago. So right around when you said it happened.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it the modem itself?

Agent: It could be. Or it could be the line coming into your house. But let's try one more thing before we go down that road. Can you do a factory reset on the modem?

Customer: A factory reset? Um... how do I do that?

Agent: There should be a small button, usually recessed, on the back of the modem. You'll need to hold it down for about ten to fifteen seconds. It might be labeled "reset" or sometimes it's just a small hole.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, I'm looking... yeah, I see it. It's a really small button back here.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to warn you, when you do this, you'll lose all your settings and you'll basically be starting from scratch. But it might clear up whatever's causing the issue.

Customer: Alright, I'm ready. Just push it for like, ten seconds?

Agent: Yeah, fifteen to be safe. Go ahead when you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Okay, pushing it now. (pause) Nothing's happening visually...

Agent: That's normal. It should take a minute or so to reset everything. Let's give it about three minutes and then see if we're getting that internet light to come on.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Alright, so I'm just... waiting?

Agent: Yep, just waiting. Use this time to maybe grab a coffee or something. (chuckles)

Customer: (brief laugh) Yeah, okay. (pause, longer silence) So how long have you been working there, at Frontier?

Agent: Oh, about four years now. Pretty interesting work, honestly.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the modem again. The green light is still there, the blue's still blinking... and the bottom one... (pause) still nothing.

Agent: [inaudible] Okay, yeah, I was worried about that. Let me ask you something. Is that blue light blinking fast or slow?

Customer: It's... medium speed? Like, not super fast, but not slow either.

Agent: Okay. And it hasn't changed since we started troubleshooting?

Customer: No, it's been doing the same thing the whole time.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, David, I'm going to be honest with you. Usually when the internet light won't come on after a reset, it indicates either a modem issue or a line issue, and I'm not really able to resolve either of those remotely.

Customer: (sighs) So what does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: It could be that, or it could be something with the line itself. What I want to do is get a technician out to your place to do an on-site diagnosis. They'll be able to tell you for sure what's going on.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back today if possible.

Agent: Let me check our availability... (typing sounds, pause) We have same-day appointments available, but they're typically in the afternoon or early evening. The earliest I can get someone out would be around 2 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean, I guess that has to work. I don't have much of a choice, do I?

Agent: I understand it's frustrating. Unfortunately, this is one of those situations where we need to get someone physical access to the equipment and the line to figure out what's happening.

Customer: Okay, so you'll schedule someone?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to set that up for you right now. Can I get a callback number and a good time window for them to arrive?

Customer: Yeah, my cell is 555-0147, same as the account. And like I said, anytime after 2 PM works.

Agent: Perfect. So we'll have a technician there between 2 and 6 PM today. I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all the details and a dispatch number. You should get that within the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay, I got it. Is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: You can leave everything plugged in and as is. There's no harm in waiting. If anything changes before the tech gets there, just note it down.

Customer: Alright, will do. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome, David. I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. But our technician should get you sorted out today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Great. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
