# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls coming up.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... uh... (pause) 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Richardson.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got you here. So your internet went down this morning, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 AM. I was just browsing and suddenly everything stopped. The WiFi icon just disappeared from my devices.

Agent: Alright, let me start with a few quick questions. Are you looking at your modem and router right now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at them. They're both in my office.

Agent: Great. Can you tell me what you're seeing? Are any of the lights lit up on the modem or router?

Customer: (pause) The modem has... uh... there's a red light on it. On the router, I see some green lights but they're not blinking like they usually do.

Agent: Okay, so the red light on the modem—that's typically indicating an issue. That's helpful. Let's try a quick reset. Can you go ahead and unplug the modem for me? Just pull it out of the wall outlet.

Customer: Yeah, doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's out.

Agent: Perfect. While that's unplugged, go ahead and unplug the router as well.

Customer: (pause) Got it. Both are unplugged now.

Agent: Great. I want you to wait about 30 seconds, and then we'll plug the modem back in first. Just give me a second...

(silence)

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Plugging it in. It's starting to boot up. Lights are coming on... there's the red light again at the top, and now I see some orange lights.

Agent: Okay, so we should see those orange lights for a bit as it's initializing. That's normal. Let's give it about 60 seconds to fully boot up. In the meantime, I'm going to check a few things on my end here.

Customer: Sure, no problem.

(pause with background noise of the modem)

Agent: Okay, James, can you tell me what you're seeing now? Any changes?

Customer: Um... the orange lights are still there. I don't see any green lights anymore. Is that... is that bad?

Agent: It depends. The orange lights typically mean it's still connecting. Let's give it another minute or two. Sometimes these take a little while. Did you go ahead and plug the router back in?

Customer: Oh, no, I didn't. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and plug that back in as well.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it in now. (pause) There we go. The router's starting up too.

Agent: Good. And what are we seeing on the modem now? Any changes?

Customer: (pause) Still orange. No green lights.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, James, let me check something on my end. Can you hold for just one moment? I want to pull up some diagnostics on your line.

Customer: Yeah, sure, no problem.

(hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So I'm not seeing a connection on our end either. The modem should be sending us some signal data, but I'm not getting anything. Have you had any recent storms or weather in your area?

Customer: No, actually the weather's been fine. It was just fine yesterday when everything was working.

Agent: Okay, and to your knowledge, has anything changed with your setup recently? Any new equipment, or did you move anything around?

Customer: No, nothing. It's all been the same for months. I don't understand what happened.

Agent: I understand. This can definitely be puzzling. Let me ask—do you have a backup phone or another device where you could check if you're picking up any WiFi networks at all?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I've got my phone here. Let me look... (pause) No, there's nothing. I don't see any networks showing up. Not even my neighbors' WiFi, which I usually see.

Agent: Okay, that tells me the router isn't broadcasting. That's actually good information. Let me try one more thing with you. Can you locate the reset button on the back of your modem? It's usually a small button you need to hold down.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. Do I... do I press it?

Agent: Hold it down for about 10 seconds. This will do a full reset on the modem. Fair warning—this will clear your settings, so we might need to reconfigure it after.

Customer: Okay... (pause) holding it down... (pause) I see the lights going crazy for a second... (pause) Okay, I let go.

Agent: Alright. Let's wait about two minutes for it to fully restart and reconfigure itself.

(longer pause with background noise)

Agent: Okay, James, what are we seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Um... the same thing. Red light, and now some orange lights. No green. This is... this isn't working, is it?

Agent: I know this is frustrating. Unfortunately, the fact that we're not seeing any connection on our end, combined with the modem lights not turning green, suggests there might be an issue with the modem itself or possibly with the line coming into your home. That's beyond what I can troubleshoot over the phone.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long until someone can come out?

Agent: Well, I can definitely get a technician scheduled for you. We typically have availability within the next one to two business days, depending on your area. Given that you mentioned you have work calls coming up, let me see what we can do. (typing sounds) What does your schedule look like tomorrow?

Customer: Tomorrow should work. Morning would be better if possible. I really need this fixed soon.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability... (pause) Okay, I can get you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. How does that sound?

Customer: Yeah, that works. Do I need to do anything before they come out?

Agent: Just make sure the modem and router are left plugged in. The tech will want to see how they're behaving. And they'll likely bring a replacement modem just in case, so they should be able to get you back up and running pretty quickly.

Customer: Okay, got it. So tomorrow morning, 8 to 12.

Agent: That's correct. Let me confirm all this information for you. Your service address is 847 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yes.

Agent: Perfect. And the best number to reach you on is 555-0147?

Customer: That's right.

Agent: Excellent, James. You're all set. Your appointment is scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. A technician will be out to assess the issue and get your internet restored. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I hope they can fix it quickly.

Agent: I hope so too. I know how important your internet is. I apologize that we couldn't resolve this over the phone, but the tech team is really good at diagnosing these kinds of issues. You should be back up and running in no time.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
