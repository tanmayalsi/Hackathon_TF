Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get this fixed. I work from home and I can't do anything without it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's the same as the number I'm calling from. 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I see your account here. It looks like you're in the Centerville area on our Fiber service. And you're saying your internet went down this morning?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 AM. I turned on my computer and... nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Alright, let's walk through some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is your modem powered on? Can you check if the lights are on?

Customer: Hold on, let me go look at it. (pause) Yeah, okay, so the modem is on. There's like... a green light on the front and then there's a red light next to it. Is that normal?

Agent: Okay, so the green light is good, but that red light could indicate an issue with your connection. Let me ask you this—do you have a router as well, or are you using the modem's built-in WiFi?

Customer: I have a separate router. It's a Netgear thing. The router... let me see... it's got some lights on it too, but they're all orange right now. They're usually blue.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The orange lights suggest the router isn't getting a signal from the modem. We need to restart both devices. Let's start with the modem first. Can you unplug it for me?

Customer: Yeah, unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, it's off.

Agent: Good. Let it sit unplugged for about thirty seconds. While we wait, I'm going to check if there are any service outages in your area. (pause) Alright, it looks like there are no reported outages near you, so we should be able to resolve this. Go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) It's booting back up. The lights are... the green one's back, but that red one is still there.

Agent: Still seeing the red light, huh? (pause) Let me check something on my end. Can you tell me if the red light is blinking or solid?

Customer: Um... it's solid. Just solid red.

Agent: That typically means there's no signal coming from our network to your modem. That's interesting. And you haven't moved the modem or changed anything recently?

Customer: No, nothing. It was working fine yesterday. I was streaming, checking email, everything was normal.

Agent: Right, okay. Let me try something else. Can you restart your router as well? Unplug it and wait about thirty seconds, just like we did with the modem.

Customer: Sure, one sec. (pause) Router's unplugged. How long do you need me to wait?

Agent: Thirty seconds should do it. Just... give it about half a minute and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. It's starting up... the lights are... they're still orange though. Same as before.

Agent: I see. And the modem still has that red light?

Customer: Yeah, still red.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to check a couple more things on our end here. (typing sounds, pause) Hmm. So I'm looking at your modem's signal status, and it's showing as offline on our network. That's the issue right there. The modem isn't registering with our system.

Customer: What does that mean? Is something wrong with the modem?

Agent: It could be a few things. It might be an issue with the modem itself, or it could be a line issue on our end. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you check the cable connection on the back of the modem? The coaxial cable—it's the thick cable that connects to the wall and to the modem.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. It looks... pretty secure? It's tight. Wait, actually, let me try wiggling it. (pause) No, it seems fine.

Agent: Okay. Is there any visible damage to the cable or the connector? Any corrosion or anything like that?

Customer: No, it looks fine to me. Pretty clean.

Agent: Alright. At this point, we've done the standard troubleshooting steps. Let me try power cycling the modem one more time, but this time I'm going to monitor the signal on our end while you do it. (pause) Go ahead and unplug the modem again.

Customer: Unplugging. (pause) It's off.

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm watching the network status. Go ahead and plug it back in when you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in now. (pause) Okay... same thing. Green light and a red light.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I'm not seeing any signal coming through on our end. This is... this is strange. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check with our technical team to see if there's an issue in your area that we haven't logged yet. I'll be right back, okay?

Customer: Sure, yeah.

Agent: (hold music, pause lasting about two minutes) Thank you for your patience. I checked with our technical team and we're not seeing any outages in your service area. However, we may have a line issue that needs to be investigated physically. That could be why the modem isn't registering a signal.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: We have two options. First, I can try having a replacement modem sent to you, which could take three to five business days, and you'd need to set it up when it arrives. Or, we can dispatch a technician to your location to investigate the line issue directly. A technician visit would be faster—we could potentially get someone out tomorrow or the day after depending on our schedule.

Customer: How much would a technician visit cost?

Agent: Since we haven't determined if this is an issue on your side or our infrastructure yet, there would be no service charge if we find the problem is on our end. If it's determined to be something with your equipment, there may be a fee, but let's get it diagnosed first.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I need my internet back as soon as possible. Can you send a technician tomorrow?

Agent: Let me check availability. (typing sounds) What's the best window for you tomorrow? We have morning slots between 8 AM and noon, or afternoon slots between 1 PM and 5 PM.

Customer: Um, morning is better for me. Like 8 to noon.

Agent: Perfect. I'm scheduling a technician visit for tomorrow, [inaudible], between 8 AM and noon. Can I confirm that address is still... 447 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation call from our dispatch team sometime this evening. Is there anything else I can help you with while we get this resolved?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I hope it gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I understand, and I'm sorry you're experiencing this issue. Our technician will get to the bottom of it. You should be back online very soon. Is there anything else I can answer for you?

Customer: No, that's all. Thank you for your help.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow morning. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
