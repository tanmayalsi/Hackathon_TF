Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work to do and I can't connect to anything.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. And your name is...?

Customer: James. James Morrison.

Agent: Great, James. So you're unable to connect to the internet at all this morning. When did you first notice this?

Customer: I'd say around 7 or 8 AM. I tried to check my email and nothing was loading. Just... nothing. The WiFi signal shows up on my phone, but it won't actually connect.

Agent: Okay, so the WiFi network is visible but you're not able to connect. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you check your modem and router for me? Are there any lights on them right now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, uh... looking at them now. The modem has... the power light is on, it's green. But, um, the internet light—that one's red. Or actually, it's off. I'm not sure.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is on but the internet light isn't showing green. That's helpful information. And what about your router? Are there any lights on that one?

Customer: The router... yeah, it's got some lights. They're blinking. I think... orange? Or yellow maybe? I'm not great with all this technical stuff.

Agent: (chuckles) No worries, that's what I'm here for. So the lights on the router are blinking orange or yellow, which typically means it's trying to establish a connection but hasn't been successful yet. Here's what I'd like you to do—let's do a restart. Can you unplug your modem first?

Customer: Unplug it. Yeah, okay. (rustling sounds) It's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about thirty seconds just to make sure it fully powers down. While we're waiting, James, can you tell me... have there been any storms in your area recently? Or any construction work?

Customer: Storms? No, not that I know of. Why do you ask?

Agent: Just checking, because sometimes weather or construction can affect the line connection. Okay, and it's been about thirty seconds now. Can you go ahead and plug the modem back in?

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in. Okay, it's back in. The green light's on again.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait for it to fully boot up. This usually takes about two to three minutes. While we're waiting, we can try the router. Can you unplug that as well?

Customer: Sure thing. (rustling) Unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give that the same treatment—thirty seconds or so—and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, waiting... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Good. So now we're going to give both devices a few minutes to synchronize with each other. While we're waiting, are you seeing any changes on that modem? Is the internet light still off or... ?

Customer: (pause) Uh... still looks pretty red to me. Or dark. It's definitely not green.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let's give it just another minute or two. Sometimes it takes a little longer to establish the connection. (pause) You know what, let me check something on my end. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Thanks for holding. Okay, so I'm looking at your service here, and I'm not seeing any outages in your area, which is good news. But I am showing that your connection status is showing as offline on our end. Let me ask you—when was the last time your internet was working normally?

Customer: Yesterday afternoon. I was on it until maybe 5 or 6 PM, no problems. Went to bed, woke up this morning and it was just... gone.

Agent: Okay, so it went down overnight sometime. And you haven't had any power outages or anything at your house?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of, no. Like, my lights are all on, the TV works fine.

Agent: Right, right. Um, can you check the modem again for me? What's that internet light showing now?

Customer: (pause) Still red. Maybe getting a tiny bit lighter but... still not green, I don't think.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else here. On the back of your modem, there should be a small reset button. It's usually recessed pretty far in. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause, sounds of objects moving) I see... there's a bunch of cables back here. Um... I think I see it? There's like a little hole...

Agent: That's probably it. Now, I want to be careful here because a reset will wipe out your settings, but at this point it might help. I'm going to have you hold a paperclip or something thin in that hole for about ten seconds. Are you ready?

Customer: Yeah, okay. I've got a paperclip. Going in... (pause) How long?

Agent: Just count to ten slowly.

Customer: (pause) Okay, pulling it out. Now what?

Agent: Now let's unplug the modem again, wait about a minute, and plug it back in. This time it should go through its full startup sequence.

Customer: (rustling sounds, pause) Unplugging... waiting... (long pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) The green light came on for a second but now it's... red again. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand, James. I know this is really frustrating. Let me... let me take a closer look at what might be happening here. (typing sounds) I'm checking the diagnostics on our end and, um... (pause) I'm actually not seeing a valid signal coming from your location to our network.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: It means the modem is trying to communicate with our network, but we're not receiving that signal on our end. This could indicate a few different things—it could be an issue with the modem itself, or it could be an issue with the line coming into your house from the street.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: (pause) Well, I hate to say this, but I think at this point we might need to get a technician out to your location to do some physical inspection of the line and potentially replace the modem. I can absolutely schedule that for you.

Customer: Really? How long would that take? I need my internet for work.

Agent: I know. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) So our next available appointment is... tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have Thursday afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works. Can I get that scheduled?

Agent: Absolutely. Before I do that, let me just try one more thing real quick. Sometimes if I send a reset command from our end, it can kickstart the connection. Let me try that. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I've sent that. Give it about thirty seconds to see if anything changes.

Customer: (long pause) No... nothing. Still the same.

Agent: Alright. Yeah, I think a technician visit is really your best bet at this point. Let me get you scheduled for tomorrow. Your address on file is 447 Maple Street, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to get you scheduled for tomorrow, March 15th, between 8 and 12. Is there a specific time window within that that works best for you?

Customer: Morning's fine. Earlier is better if possible.

Agent: I'll make a note of that. And just to confirm, we'll be looking at the line and potentially replacing the modem. If it is the modem, there's a ninety-nine dollar fee, but if it's a line issue, that would be covered under your service. Does that sound okay?

Customer: I guess so. I mean... yeah, okay.

Agent: Great. You're all set for tomorrow morning. A technician will arrive between 8 AM and noon. You should get a confirmation text or email shortly. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully they can get it working tomorrow.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved remotely today, but our technician will definitely take care of you. Thank you for calling Frontier, and have a great day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
