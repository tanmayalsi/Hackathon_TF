# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. And your address is on Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So when did you first notice the internet was down?

Customer: Around 8 AM this morning. I was trying to work from home and just... nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Okay, and have you had any power outages or storms in your area recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Everything else is working fine. The lights, TV, all that stuff.

Agent: Good, good. Let me just walk you through a few basic troubleshooting steps, okay? First, can you look at your modem? It should be a white box with some lights on it.

Customer: Yeah, I see it.

Agent: Great. What color are the lights? Are they on or off?

Customer: Um, most of them are off. There's a red light, I think. And that one's been red all morning.

Agent: Okay, so the red light typically means there's no connection coming in. Let's try unplugging the modem for about thirty seconds. Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay... it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Just let it sit for... (pause) ...about thirty seconds. Go ahead and count it out.

Customer: (pause) Alright, should be about thirty seconds now.

Agent: Okay, plug it back in please.

Customer: (electrical hum, plugging sounds) Done. Now what?

Agent: Now let's wait for the lights to come back up. This usually takes about a minute or so. What you're looking for is a solid green light on the internet connection. Can you just watch it for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm watching... Come on, come on... (pause) Uh, they're coming back on. I see... I see green, and... oh, it's turning red again.

Agent: It's turning red?

Customer: Yeah. It was green for like two seconds and now it's back to red. That's weird, right?

Agent: That is unusual. Okay, that tells me there might be an issue with the signal coming into your home. Let me check a couple of things here. (typing sounds) Have you noticed any recent changes? Like, did you move anything or have any cable work done recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It just... it just stopped working.

Agent: Alright. Can you check the cable coming out of the wall? Make sure it's tightly connected to the back of the modem?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Hold on... yeah, no, it looks pretty tight. I'm trying to wiggle it a little and it seems... it's in there pretty good.

Agent: Okay. Let me try something else. Can you unplug the modem again and this time also unplug the router if you have one?

Customer: The router... is that the other box?

Agent: Yes, usually it's a black or gray box, probably near the modem.

Customer: Oh, I think I see it. Yeah, I'm unplugging both now.

Agent: Great. This time let them sit for about a minute. I'm also going to check our network status on my end real quick. (pause, typing sounds) 

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been about a minute.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first. We'll give that about two minutes to fully boot up before we plug in the router.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Okay, modem's in.

Agent: (pause) So we're looking at about two minutes. I'm checking our system and I'm not showing any outages in your area, so that's a good sign.

Customer: So what could it be then?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be signal degradation on the line, an issue with the equipment, or sometimes there's a provisioning issue on our end. Let's see if the modem comes online this time.

Customer: (pause) Um... same thing. Green for a second, then back to red.

Agent: (sighs) Okay. That's... that's telling me the modem is trying to connect but can't complete the handshake with our network. Let me put you on a quick hold while I escalate this to our technical team. It should only be about thirty seconds.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (hold music plays for approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Alright, I'm back. So I've reviewed everything, and it looks like this could be a line issue or possibly something on our network side. Since we've done the basic troubleshooting and the modem keeps disconnecting, I think we need to get a technician out to your location.

Customer: A technician? How long is that going to take?

Agent: Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) The earliest I can get someone out to you is tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I need internet today. I have work I need to get done.

Agent: I completely understand, and I wish I had something sooner. Unfortunately, all our same-day slots are booked. But the good news is once the technician gets there, they can diagnose the issue properly. It could be something quick to fix.

Customer: (frustrated) This is really not ideal. I mean, I'm paying for this service and now I can't even use it.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the inconvenience. If you can take the appointment tomorrow, I'll make sure to note on your account that this is urgent. And let me waive the service call fee for you as a courtesy. Normally that would be $99, but you won't be charged for that.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I guess I don't have a choice. Tomorrow between 12 and 4.

Agent: Perfect. I have you down for tomorrow, June 15th, between 12 PM and 4 PM. A technician will come out and we'll get this sorted out. You should receive a confirmation email within the hour, and we'll call you an hour before the technician arrives to confirm.

Customer: Alright. Anything else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: Unfortunately at this point, I'd recommend leaving the modem and router unplugged until the technician gets there. If you plug them in, it might run up against our system again and drain the backup battery. Is there anything else I can help clarify?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I'm just frustrated, you know?

Agent: I totally get it. I appreciate your patience, and we'll get this resolved tomorrow. Your technician's number will be in that confirmation email if you need to reach them. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all.

Agent: Alright, thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
