Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I have a work meeting in like an hour.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I'll definitely help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. I'm pulling up your account now. And your name is...?

Customer: David. David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I see your account here. So you're on our Fiber 100 plan. When exactly did you notice the internet go down?

Customer: This morning, around 6:30 AM. I went to check my email and nothing was loading. I tried restarting my router, but that didn't help.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on restarting the router. Let me ask you a few questions. When you look at your router right now, what lights are you seeing? Are any of them lit up?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, so there's a power light that's on, it's green. But the internet light—I think that's the blue one—that's not on at all.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on but the internet light is off. That tells me the modem might not be connecting to our network. Can you do me a favor and unplug the modem for about 30 seconds? Completely unplug it from the power outlet.

Customer: Sure, yeah. (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we wait, let me just ask—have you had any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Weather's been fine.

Agent: Okay, good. And you haven't noticed any construction or anything going on outside your house?

Customer: No, nothing that I've seen.

Agent: Alright. (pause) It should be about 30 seconds now. Go ahead and plug that back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. (pause) Hmm, the power light is green again, but I'm still not seeing the blue light come on.

Agent: Let's give it just a moment. Sometimes it takes about 30 to 45 seconds for everything to boot back up fully.

Customer: Okay, I'm watching it... (pause) Nothing yet.

Agent: Still nothing? Okay. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your service address here—is that 447 Maple Street in Springfield?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any outages in your area, which is good news. But I am going to look at your modem status. (pause) Hmm. Okay, so on our end, your modem is showing as offline. It's not connecting to our network at all.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it broken?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be the modem, or it could be an issue with the line coming into your house. Let me try one more thing. Do you see any cables connected to the back of your modem?

Customer: Yeah, there's... there's like a gray cable coming in from the wall, and then some other cables for power.

Agent: That's the coaxial cable, the gray one. That's the main line. Can you check that connection? Make sure it's tightly screwed in on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Okay, checking the back of the modem... it looks pretty tight already, but let me try twisting it a bit more. (pause) There we go, I think I tightened it a bit.

Agent: Good. Now can you check the other end of that cable where it connects to the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that one looks secure too, but... (pause) actually, wait. There's a little bit of dust around it. Let me... (pause) Okay, it's tight.

Agent: Alright. Give it another minute and see if that blue light comes on.

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand. Let me try rebooting your modem from our system here. That way we can see if it responds. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm sending a reboot command now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, the power light just flickered off for a second, and now it's back on again.

Agent: Good, that means it received the command. Let's wait and see if we get that internet light now. (pause) How's it looking?

Customer: (pause) Still just the green light. The blue one is not coming back on.

Agent: (sigh) Okay, David, I'm going to be honest with you. Based on what we're seeing, either there's an issue with the modem itself, or there could be a line problem between the wall and your house. When did you last have working internet?

Customer: Yesterday afternoon, everything was fine. I used it for a couple hours before I went to bed.

Agent: Okay, so it was working fine yesterday. And you haven't touched anything—no new equipment, nothing like that?

Customer: No, nothing. It just stopped working when I woke up.

Agent: Let me try one more thing. Do you have your modem model number? It should be on a sticker on the back or bottom of the device.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it says... FN-G2000.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking that up. (pause) That's one of our newer units, so it shouldn't be the issue, but... (pause) Let me see if there are any known issues with that model. (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing anything major.

Customer: So what do we do? I really need this working soon.

Agent: I understand, David. (pause) Here's what I'm thinking. We could try replacing your modem. I can arrange to have a technician bring one out today, but unfortunately the earliest I can get someone to you would be between 2 and 6 PM this afternoon.

Customer: Wait, that's... can't you just troubleshoot it more? There's gotta be something else we can try, right?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me try a few more things. Can you check if there's a reset button on your modem? It should be a small button on the back.

Customer: (pause) I see it, yeah. There's a tiny button here.

Agent: Okay, but only press that as a last resort because it will wipe all the settings. Before we do that, let me check something else. Can you tell me—is the modem getting hot at all? Is it warm to the touch?

Customer: (pause) No, it feels fine. Room temperature.

Agent: Okay, that's good. That means it's not overheating. (pause) Let me try sending another reboot from our end. Maybe the first one didn't fully process. (typing sounds) Sending it now.

Customer: (pause) Same thing. Power light's flickering... and it's back to green, but no blue light.

Agent: (long pause) Alright, I've tried everything I can from my end, David. At this point, I really do think we need to get a technician out there or replace the modem. 

Customer: This is unbelievable. Can't you like... send someone out sooner? Or can you credit me for today or something?

Agent: I hear you, and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Let me see what I can do. (pause) I'm going to get a technician scheduled for this afternoon. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check availability.

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent: Thank you, David. (hold music, brief pause) Okay, David, I've got a technician available between 3 and 5 PM today. Will that work for you?

Customer: (sigh) I guess it'll have to. What if they find out the problem is on Frontier's end? Will I get credited?

Agent: That's a fair question. If it's determined to be an issue with our infrastructure or the line, yes, we can absolutely discuss a credit for today's service interruption. The technician will determine that when they arrive.

Customer: Okay, fine. So what's the confirmation number or whatever I need?

Agent: (typing sounds) Your service appointment number is FR-847293. The technician will be there between 3 and 5 PM. Can I get a phone number to reach you at that time?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?

Customer: No, I... I guess I'll just wait and hope they can fix it. I'm gonna try my phone hotspot for my meeting, I guess.

Agent: I'm really sorry about this, David. We'll get it sorted out. The technician will take good care of you this afternoon.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: Thank you for your patience, David. We appreciate your business with Frontier Communications.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Have a good day.
