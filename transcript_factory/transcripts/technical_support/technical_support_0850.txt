Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up and running. I work from home and I've got meetings starting in like an hour.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I definitely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. I'm seeing an account here for... is this Derek at 428 Maple Street?

Customer: No, actually it's... it's Michael. Michael Chen. Same phone number though.

Agent: Got it, Michael. Thanks for that. So your internet went down this morning. Have you tried restarting your modem and router yet?

Customer: Um, I tried unplugging the modem this morning, yeah. Let it sit for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in, but nothing changed. Still no lights, no connection.

Agent: Okay, so the modem isn't showing any lights at all? Not even a power light?

Customer: Right, nothing. It's completely dark.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm, the power cable is definitely connected to the modem and to the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, of course it is. I mean... let me just double-check here. (pause) Yeah, it's plugged in. The outlet's working fine because my router's plugged into it and... well, I mean, actually, let me check the router too. (pause) Hmm, the router does have its lights on, but the modem's dead.

Agent: Okay, so the modem has no power. That could be a few things. Do you happen to have a different power outlet you could try? Sometimes outlets go bad.

Customer: Sure, let me try that. (pause) Okay, moving it over here... (pause) I'm plugging it in now... and... (long pause) Nope. Still nothing. Not even a light.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful information. It does sound like the modem itself might be the issue then. Before we go down that road though, let me just ask—have there been any storms in your area recently? Any power outages or anything like that?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear weather. I mean, there was some wind yesterday, but nothing crazy. Why do you ask?

Agent: Just ruling things out. Sometimes surge damage or power issues can affect the equipment. Um, so the modem's completely unresponsive. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) Can you tell me what model modem you have? It should be labeled on the back or bottom of the unit.

Customer: (pause) Let me flip it over here... It says FR-G-100 or something like that?

Agent: FR-G-100, okay. And that came with your setup, or did you bring your own modem?

Customer: No, it came with the service. You guys provided it.

Agent: Right, right. Okay, Michael, I'm going to be honest with you. Based on what you're describing—no power lights at all, tried multiple outlets—it sounds like the modem has failed. It could be a power supply issue or something internal. These things do happen occasionally.

Customer: Oh man, are you kidding me? So what does that mean? How long until you can send me a new one?

Agent: Well, let me see what I can do. I can absolutely get a replacement modem out to you. But let me try one more thing first, if you don't mind. Do you have a paperclip or something small and pointed nearby?

Customer: Um, yeah, I think so. What for?

Agent: There's a small reset button on the back of the modem. It's recessed pretty far in. If you press and hold it for about ten seconds, sometimes that can help bring the device back to life. It's unlikely, but worth a shot.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking for it... (pause) I think I see it. It's really tiny. Okay, I'm using a paperclip here and I'm pressing it... (pause) How long did you say?

Agent: About ten seconds. Just hold it steady.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... (pause) Ten seconds, right? (pause) Alright, nothing's happening.

Agent: Still no lights?

Customer: Nope. Nothing. Still completely dead.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, okay. I think we can safely say the modem's not coming back from this one. Um, let me get a replacement order processed for you here. (typing sounds) Unfortunately, we're looking at a 3 to 5 business day window for shipping in your area. 

Customer: Three to five days? That's... that's not going to work for me. I need my internet back today if possible.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see if there's anything else we can do. (pause) So, do you have access to a mobile hotspot from your phone, or a phone plan that supports tethering?

Customer: I mean, I have a phone with unlimited data, but my work requires a stable connection. The hotspot's not reliable enough for video calls and transferring files.

Agent: Right, yeah, I hear that. Let me check if we have any expedited options... (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so we do have expedited overnight shipping available, but that would be an additional charge of $29.99. And I should mention, we'd need to confirm that you actually need the replacement before we can process that.

Customer: I mean, we already confirmed it, didn't we? The modem's dead. I've tried everything you suggested.

Agent: I know, and I hear you. But just to be thorough, I want to try one more diagnostic. Can you unplug the modem from the outlet and just wait about two minutes this time? A full reset?

Customer: (pause) I already did that earlier.

Agent: I know, but sometimes a longer wait helps with these things. Could you humor me?

Customer: (sighing) Okay, fine. Unplugging it now. (pause) I guess I'll wait...

Agent: Take your time.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, it's been about two minutes. Plugging it back in now... (pause) And... (pause) Still nothing. Derek, I really don't think this is going to work.

Agent: Yeah, I'm... I'm not getting my hopes up either, to be honest. Okay, let me get this expedited replacement set up for you. That way you'll have it tomorrow by end of business.

Customer: (frustrated) And I'm paying the extra thirty dollars?

Agent: (pause) I'm going to see if I can waive that for you, given the situation. One second. (brief hold music plays, then comes back) You know what, I've applied a courtesy credit to your account for the expedited shipping. So you won't be charged the $29.99.

Customer: Oh, well... okay. Thanks, I guess. So tomorrow then?

Agent: Tomorrow, yes. I'm going to need a signature on delivery though, so make sure someone's home. And Michael, I'm really sorry about this. I know it's incredibly inconvenient.

Customer: Yeah, well, I'll figure something out for today. What's my confirmation number?

Agent: (typing) Your confirmation number is 7-8-9-4-2-X-Ray. That's 789-42-X-R. Your modem should arrive tomorrow between 8 AM and 6 PM. The tracking information will be sent to your email on file.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. And again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We really appreciate your patience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Okay, well, thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Bye.

Agent: Take care, Michael. Have a good day.
