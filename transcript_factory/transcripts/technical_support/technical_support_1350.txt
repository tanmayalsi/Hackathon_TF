Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just completely went out about an hour ago, and I've tried unplugging everything and waiting, but it's still not working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's the number you just called me from, actually. (pause) 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, got you here. I see you're on our fiber plan. And when did you first notice the internet went out?

Customer: Like I said, about an hour ago maybe? I was just working from home and suddenly everything stopped. No warning or anything.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Before we go further, let me just confirm—do you see any lights on your modem right now? What color are they?

Customer: Um... (pause) yeah, so I'm looking at it now. There's a red light on the front. It's just... solid red.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. A solid red light typically indicates there's a connection issue. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull it out of the power outlet.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now while we wait, I'm just going to check something on your account. (typing sounds) Just give it about 30 seconds unplugged, alright?

Customer: Yeah, no problem. So... this happens sometimes with fiber, or is this unusual?

Agent: It can happen occasionally, usually it's something simple. A lot of times it's just a power cycle that fixes it. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: Plugging it back in now... (pause) Okay, it's back in. What should I see?

Agent: You should see the lights start blinking. Give it about a minute to fully boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, they're... they're blinking now. That's a good sign, right?

Agent: That's a good sign, yeah. Give it just another 30 seconds or so to fully connect.

Customer: Okay... (longer pause) I'm still just seeing... hmm. It looks like it went back to solid red. That's not right.

Agent: (pause) Okay, the solid red came back. Alright, let me check the network on our end here. (typing sounds) Can you tell me—do you have a gateway or just a modem?

Customer: I think it's both in one? It's the box that Frontier installed when they set up the service.

Agent: Right, that's the gateway. That makes sense. And there should be a little reset button on the back of it. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's kind of recessed in there.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to have you do a factory reset. You'll need a paperclip or something thin. Just hold down that button for about 10 seconds.

Customer: Alright, I'm... I'm doing that now. (pause) Holding it down. (pause) This is taking a while.

Agent: Just keep holding it for the full 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I let go. Now what?

Agent: Now let it sit for a couple minutes while it resets. This might take a little longer than the power cycle.

Customer: How long exactly? I'm kind of in the middle of something work-wise, so...

Agent: I know, I understand. Should be about 2 to 3 minutes. While we wait, let me check if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) Can I get your street address real quick?

Customer: Sure, it's 2847 Maple Drive. That's M-A-P-L-E.

Agent: (typing sounds) Thank you. I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area, which is good. (pause) So what's the status on the lights now?

Customer: They're still... they're blinking now, but kind of slow. Is that normal?

Agent: That's actually normal during the reset. It should speed up once it's fully booted. Give it another minute.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) They're still slow. When should I know if this worked?

Agent: Within the next 30 seconds or so you should see a solid green light, or you should have the internet come back. Do you have a computer or phone you can test with?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my laptop right here. Let me... (pause) let me try to open a website. (pause) No, nothing's loading. It's not connecting.

Agent: Okay, not connecting yet. The gateway might still be booting. Give it another 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. I'm refreshing and... no, it's still not working. The Wi-Fi isn't even showing up on my laptop.

Agent: Alright, the Wi-Fi network isn't showing up. That's... that's a different issue then. Let me ask you this—did you change anything with your setup recently? Add any new equipment or make any changes to the wiring?

Customer: No, nothing. It was working fine before. I didn't touch anything.

Agent: Right, okay. And the reset button—sometimes that erases your Wi-Fi settings. Let me see if we can access the gateway settings. Do you have the access code that came with your equipment? It should be on a sticker somewhere on the gateway.

Customer: (pause) Let me look... (longer pause) I'm not seeing... I don't see a sticker. I think I might've lost that paperwork.

Agent: That's alright. Let me try a different approach. Let's see if we're getting signal on our end. (typing sounds) [inaudible] Let me check the signal levels coming into your gateway from the network. (pause) Hmm. That's interesting.

Customer: What? Is something wrong?

Agent: Well, I'm not seeing a strong signal coming through to your equipment. I'm seeing... (pause) it's very low. It's possible there's an issue with the fiber line itself coming into your home.

Customer: Oh no. What does that mean?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be a loose connection, or it could be an issue with the line outside. (pause) Here's what I'd like to do. I want to get a technician out to you to take a look at the physical connection. They can check the fiber line and make sure everything is connected properly.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability. What does your schedule look like? Are you available tomorrow?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean... I'd prefer today if possible. This is affecting my work.

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately, I'm not seeing any same-day appointments available in your area right now. But I do have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) I guess that'll have to work. Can you do afternoon though? I have meetings in the morning.

Agent: Let me see... (typing sounds) I might have something between 1 and 5 PM. Yes, I can get you scheduled for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM window.

Customer: Alright, yeah, that works. And they'll be able to fix this?

Agent: The technician will come out and diagnose the issue. They'll check all the connections and if it's something on our end or with your equipment. If it's a fiber line issue, they can typically repair that on the spot. If it's equipment, they might need to replace it.

Customer: Okay. And I'm not going to get charged extra for this, right?

Agent: Since we couldn't resolve it remotely and there appears to be a network-side issue, there shouldn't be a technician visit fee. That'll be covered.

Customer: Good. Alright. So is there anything else I can try in the meantime? Just to see if anything changes?

Agent: You can try one more time to unplug the gateway, wait about 30 seconds, and plug it back in. But other than that, I'd hold off until the technician can take a look.

Customer: Okay, I'll try that. But realistically, it's not going to work, is it?

Agent: (pause) Honestly, probably not if you're not getting signal on our end. But it's worth a shot.

Customer: Yeah, alright. So tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM. How will they contact me?

Agent: They'll call you at this number about 30 minutes before they arrive to confirm. And I'm going to put a note on your account about what we troubleshot today.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you for trying, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today. The technician should get you sorted out tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye.
