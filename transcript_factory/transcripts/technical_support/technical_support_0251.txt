# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls coming up and I can't do anything without it.

Agent: I completely understand how frustrating that must be. I'm sorry you're experiencing that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's under James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got you here. I can see you're on our Fiber 200 plan in the Denver area. So your internet went down this morning, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 AM. I woke up and there was no connection at all. I tried unplugging the modem but that didn't help.

Agent: Alright, well I'm glad you already tried that. Let me ask you a few questions. When you say there's no connection, are you seeing any lights on the modem at all right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, there's... let me look. The power light is on, it's green, but the internet light is red. It's just solid red.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. A solid red light on the internet indicator typically means there's no connection to our network. Have there been any recent storms in your area, or any changes to your setup?

Customer: No storms. It was just... fine yesterday. I was on it last night, everything was working normally.

Agent: Got it. And are you connected via WiFi or ethernet cable?

Customer: WiFi. The router's right here next to my desk.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, I'm just going to have you try a full restart of the modem for me. Can you do that? Unplug it completely from the power outlet, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in.

Customer: Sure, yeah. (sounds of movement, pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (longer pause) Thirty seconds... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. While that's booting back up, which usually takes about two to three minutes, let me check if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) Can you also tell me... do you have your modem and router as separate units, or is it a combo unit?

Customer: They're separate. The modem's a Frontier one, and I've got like a Netgear router.

Agent: Okay, good to know. Let me just... (pause, typing) I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end in your area right now. That's actually good news in a way. It means the issue is likely isolated to your equipment or your line. Are you seeing any lights changed on the modem now?

Customer: Um, the power light's still green, but the internet light is still red. Maybe it needs more time?

Agent: It might, yeah. Usually within three minutes you should see it come back up. Let me ask you this—have you had any technician work done at your home recently? Any construction or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. It's been pretty quiet.

Agent: Okay. And just to confirm, you're definitely seeing the WiFi network showing up on your devices, you're just not getting internet through it, correct?

Customer: Right, yeah. My phone shows the network is there, I can connect to it, but nothing loads. Pages just... they don't load, it times out.

Agent: Uh-huh. That's consistent with what we're seeing on the modem side. Alright, so we've got a few more things we can try. Have you checked to make sure the cables going into the modem are all secure? Sometimes they can get... [inaudible] ...bumped or loosened.

Customer: Oh, let me see. (pause) Yeah, I'm checking now. There's one cable going in the back... (pause) Looks pretty tight to me. Let me try... (grunting sound) No, it seems solid.

Agent: Okay, good. And the cable coming from the wall outlet into the modem—do you see any damage on that at all?

Customer: No, that one looks fine too.

Agent: Alright. (pause) The modem's been back on for... it should be approaching that three-minute mark. Are you seeing any change in the internet light yet?

Customer: (pause) No, it's still red. Still just solid red.

Agent: Okay. Um, that's... that's not ideal. Let me try one more thing. I'm going to have you do what's called a factory reset on the modem. Now, this will erase any custom settings you might have, but honestly for a Frontier modem, it usually helps. Do you want to try that?

Customer: Uh... I guess so. Will that do anything if the light's still red?

Agent: It's worth a shot. Sometimes it resets the connection protocol. Alright, look for a small reset button on the back of the modem—it might be inside a tiny hole. You'll probably need a paperclip or something similar.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's like a little recessed button.

Agent: That's the one. Now hold that down for about 10 to 15 seconds. You should see all the lights go dark momentarily.

Customer: (pause) Okay, doing it now. (pause) Yeah, all the lights went out. (pause) Now they're coming back. The power light's green again. (pause) The internet light is... (longer pause) still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay. It's been a few seconds—sometimes it takes a bit longer to reestablish the connection after a factory reset. Just give it another minute or so.

Customer: (pause) Alright. (pause) Still nothing. Red light. Still red.

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) Okay, James, I'm... I'm looking at all the diagnostics here and I'm not seeing any flags on our network end that would be causing this. Normally, when we get a solid red internet light even after a reset, it typically indicates either a hardware failure with the modem itself or an issue with the line coming to your house.

Customer: So the modem might be broken?

Agent: It's a possibility, yeah. Or it could be something with the fiber line. To be honest with you, given everything we've tried remotely, I think we're going to need to send a technician out to your location. They can check the modem, check the line, see if there's anything physically wrong that's preventing the connection.

Customer: Okay... how long would that take? I really need this fixed.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what our availability is looking like. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I'm showing we can get a technician out to you... the earliest available slot is tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Tomorrow? There's really nothing sooner? I've got conference calls this afternoon.

Agent: I'm sorry, I really wish I had something sooner. Our technicians are pretty booked up today. But if you can do tomorrow afternoon, that would get this resolved for you. You'd be back up and running by end of business tomorrow at the latest.

Customer: Yeah, I guess I'll have to do that. Can I at least use my phone as a hotspot in the meantime?

Agent: Absolutely, that's actually a great workaround. Just tether your laptop to your phone's hotspot and you should be good for your calls. It won't be as fast, but it should work.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Alright, so tomorrow between 1 and 5?

Agent: That's correct. Let me just get a few details from you to confirm the appointment. Is the number I have on file, 555-0147, still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. And the address on the account is 4829 Cherry Lane in Denver?

Customer: Yep, that's it.

Agent: Excellent. So I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, [inaudible], and a technician will be there between 1 and 5 PM. They'll be able to diagnose the issue and get you back online. You should also receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay. I appreciate it, even though I'm not thrilled about waiting until tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, James. Again, I'm really sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone today. But our technicians are really good—they'll get to the bottom of it. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll see you tomorrow. Have a good day.

Customer: Yep, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
