Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll see what we can do. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm showing an account for... is this for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely. I woke up this morning, tried to check my email, and nothing. No connection at all. The router's on, I can see the lights, but... nothing's working.

Agent: Okay, okay. Well, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on the router right now? Are they all solid, blinking, any red lights?

Customer: Um, let me look... I've got the power light on, it's solid green. The internet light is... it's like a red-orange color and it's blinking.

Agent: Alright, so that blinking orange light typically indicates a connection issue. Have you tried restarting the router yet?

Customer: No, not yet. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead. Just unplug it from the power, wait about thirty seconds, and plug it back in. I'll be right here.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) ...and waiting. This is taking forever.

Agent: I know, I know. These things always feel slow, don't they? (chuckles)

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's back on. The lights are starting to come back... okay, so now I'm seeing... the power light is green, solid. The internet light is still... it's still blinking orange.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Still blinking. Let me check a few things on our end. (typing sounds) Have you noticed any storms or weather issues in your area recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been clear all week actually.

Agent: Okay, good. Let me see here... I'm not showing any outages in your area currently. Can you tell me, when's the last time your internet was working properly?

Customer: Last night, yeah. I was watching TV on it before I went to bed, everything was fine. I'm pretty sure it just happened overnight or early this morning.

Agent: Alright. And you haven't made any changes to the setup? No new equipment or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. It's all the same as it's always been.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let me try something else. Can you unplug the modem? That's the box with all the cables running into it—it might be separate from the router or it might be combined into one unit. Do you see that?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I see it. There's a separate black box. That's the modem?

Agent: Yes, that's it. Go ahead and unplug that one for thirty seconds as well, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Doing that now... unplugged... (pause) ...thirty seconds... (pause) ...and plugging back in. Okay, it's booting up.

Agent: While that's starting up, let me check something in the system. (typing sounds) Hmm... (pause)

Customer: What? What's wrong?

Agent: Oh, nothing necessarily wrong. I'm just looking at your connection history. So when the modem boots back up, you should see the lights—

Customer: Okay, so the modem lights came back. I see... the power light is on, and I see the internet light... it's still orange. Still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Still blinking, huh? Okay. Can you check if there are any other lights on the modem? Sometimes there's a service light or—

Customer: There's like a phone light, and it's green. Everything else is... there's nothing else really. Just power, internet, and phone.

Agent: Right. Okay, so the phone connection is good but the internet is still showing that orange blinking light. That usually indicates the modem isn't getting a signal from our network. Let me pull up your modem information here. (typing sounds) What's the model of your modem? It should be printed on the back or bottom.

Customer: Um... (pause) It says... Frontier... something. Hold on. It's a Frontier D— D-something. Let me see... DSB... no... D-S-B-7... something-dot-something. I can't read this, the label's worn off.

Agent: That's alright, that's alright. I can work with that. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing here that we should have a signal coming to your address. Let me check if there have been any line issues reported. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm not seeing anything here. This is strange.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. Sometimes there's a line issue between the street and your house that we can't see immediately in the system. It could also be an issue with the modem itself. Let me try one more thing. Can you check all the cables coming out of your modem? Make sure they're all plugged in tight?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at them... there's like three cables. They all look like they're plugged in... I'll give them a little wiggle to make sure they're really in there. (pause) Yeah, they seem pretty secure.

Agent: Alright. And you're not seeing any visible damage to any of the cables? No cuts or anything?

Customer: No, they all look fine from what I can see.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Here's what I'm thinking might be happening. It could be a signal strength issue on the line, or it could be something with the modem's connection to our network. Since the basic troubleshooting hasn't worked, I'd like to escalate this to our technical team. We can either schedule a technician to come out and check the line, or... (pause) actually, let me see if there's anything else I can try first.

Customer: Okay, yeah, please do. I really need this working today if possible.

Agent: I understand. Let me check the line one more time. (typing sounds) (long pause) Hmm. (pause) I'm going to try to send a reset signal to your modem from our end. That might help. Give that a moment to process.

Customer: (pause) Okay... nothing's changed. It's still the same blinking orange light.

Agent: Yeah, I didn't think it would, but it was worth a shot. (pause) Alright, at this point I think we need to get a technician out there. There could be an issue with the line signal coming into your house, or potentially an issue with the modem itself that's preventing it from connecting to our network.

Customer: How long is that going to take? I really need internet today.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what our availability is. (typing sounds) (pause) So the earliest I can get someone out there is... (pause) tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... yeah, I guess it has to work, but I was really hoping to get this done today.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, our techs are fully booked for today, but tomorrow should be our first available window. The technician will be able to check the line from the street to your house and test the modem on-site. If it's a modem issue, they can swap it out right there.

Customer: Alright, fine. Tomorrow between 12 and 4 is... that's fine, I guess.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got that set up. You'll get a confirmation text and email with all the details. Is the phone number on the account the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. And just to recap, a technician will be coming out tomorrow between noon and 4 PM to investigate the line and test your modem. In the meantime, if you want, you can keep the modem and router powered on—sometimes things do resolve on their own overnight, though I'm not expecting that to happen in this case.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'll just leave it on. Is there anything else I should try?

Agent: No, I think we've done what we can on my end. The tech will take it from here tomorrow. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working for you today.

Customer: Alright, well, I guess I'll just have to make do without internet until tomorrow. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I'm really sorry about this. We'll get you back up and running as soon as we can. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
