# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, so my internet just went out this morning and I've been without it for like two hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I start by getting your account information? What's the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, just one moment while I pull that up. And can I get the name on the account please?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. So you mentioned your internet went out this morning. Have you tried unplugging your modem and router yet?

Customer: No, I haven't actually. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, let's try that first. That resolves a lot of connectivity issues. Go ahead and unplug both devices and just wait about 30 seconds before plugging them back in.

Customer: Okay, (pause) unplugging now. (pause) Alright, they're unplugged. Should I wait the full 30 seconds?

Agent: Yeah, just give it about 30 seconds. That helps clear the memory on the devices.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging the modem back in first... (pause) And the router... (pause) Alright, they're both back on. How long should it take to reconnect?

Agent: It should take about a minute or two for everything to boot back up. While we wait, have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: First time in a while actually. I mean, we had that one outage like a month ago but that was fixed pretty quick.

Agent: Okay, good to know. And do you see any lights on your modem right now?

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah. I see the power light, and... it looks like there's a red light blinking next to it?

Agent: Okay, so we should see a solid green light for your internet connection. The red light usually indicates there's no connection to our network. Do you see any other lights?

Customer: There's like a yellow one that's blinking, and then the red one I mentioned.

Agent: (pause) Alright, and how about on your router? What are you seeing there?

Customer: The router looks more normal. I see like, the standard lights. The power's on and the Wi-Fi looks good from what I can tell.

Agent: Okay, so the issue is really coming from the modem itself based on that red light. Let me check if there are any outages reported in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any active outages, so let's try a few more things. Can you check the cable connection where it goes into the modem? Just make sure it's firmly plugged in.

Customer: Yeah, let me check. (pause) I'm looking at it now. It looks pretty secure, but let me try unplugging it and plugging it back in to make sure.

Agent: Good idea.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. (pause) Hmm, the red light is still there though.

Agent: Alright. Do you have a phone line running to your modem as well?

Customer: A phone line? Um, I don't think so. I mean, I'm not using the phone service. I just have the internet.

Agent: Got it, so just the internet. Let me try something else here. I'm going to send a refresh signal to your modem. This might take a minute. Can you stay on the line?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (pause) Okay, go ahead and sending that now. (typing sounds) (pause) Let me give that a moment to process... (pause) Alright, can you check the modem again and tell me if the lights have changed at all?

Customer: (pause) No, it's still the same. Red and yellow lights, same as before.

Agent: (sigh) Okay. This is... that's unusual. Let me check our system here to see if there's anything showing on our end that might be preventing the connection. (pause) (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any issues with your line from our side. The modem should be able to connect.

Customer: So like, what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it typically means there's an issue with the modem itself. It's possible it's failed or there's a hardware issue. When did you last power cycle it before today?

Customer: I mean, it's been on for a while. I don't shut it off normally. But like, it was working fine last night.

Agent: Right, yeah. Have you noticed any unusual sounds coming from it? Like any beeping or anything?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It seems to be running normally otherwise. The fans are working and everything.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let me try one more thing. I'm going to walk you through a factory reset of the modem. This will erase the settings but it might help re-establish the connection. Are you ready?

Customer: Uh, sure. How do I do that?

Agent: There should be a small reset button on the back of the modem. It's usually recessed so you might need something small like a paperclip or pen to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. Do I just press it?

Agent: Yes, hold it down for about 10 seconds and the modem will restart.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm holding it down... (pause) Okay, I've let go. (pause) The lights are going crazy now, like they're flashing and resetting.

Agent: That's normal. Just let it sit for a minute and recycle completely.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) (longer pause) Still going. Should I wait longer?

Agent: Yeah, give it another minute to fully boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Alright. (long pause) Okay, I think it's done. The lights are... still red and yellow though. Same situation.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Unfortunately, James, based on everything we've tried, it's really looking like the modem is experiencing a hardware failure. I've sent the reset signal, we've power cycled it multiple times, checked all the connections, and nothing is bringing that green light back.

Customer: Oh no. So like, what happens now? Do I need to buy a new modem?

Agent: Well, what we can do is order you a replacement modem. Most of the time with Frontier service, the modem is part of your equipment lease, so we can send you a new one at no charge. It typically arrives in 3 to 5 business days.

Customer: 3 to 5 days? (pause) I mean, I need internet before then if possible. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately with the equipment failure, that's our standard timeframe. However, let me see if there's expedited shipping available. (typing sounds) (pause) So I'm looking at our options... we do have expedited shipping that could get it to you in 1 to 2 business days, but that would be an additional $19.99 charge.

Customer: (pause) Ugh. I mean, I guess I don't really have a choice, do I?

Agent: I know it's frustrating. I'm sorry you're dealing with this. The expedited option would get you back online much faster.

Customer: Yeah, okay, let's do the expedited. When would it arrive?

Agent: (typing sounds) If I place this order now, it would arrive by tomorrow or the day after. So you're looking at getting back online very soon.

Customer: Alright, I'll take it.

Agent: Great. I'm going to go ahead and submit this order for the replacement modem with expedited shipping. (typing sounds) (pause) Perfect. Your new modem is on order and should arrive by [inaudible]... excuse me, by Thursday. You'll receive a tracking number via email. In the meantime, do you have any way to access the internet from a mobile device, like a phone hotspot?

Customer: Yeah, I have my phone. I guess I can tether to that for emergencies.

Agent: That would work in the short term. Once you receive the new modem, just unbox it and follow the setup instructions inside. It should be pretty straightforward. And if you run into any issues with the new one when it arrives, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Okay. Well, this is frustrating but I appreciate your help trying to figure this out.

Agent: I'm truly sorry we couldn't get it working today, James. I know it's inconvenient. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just hopefully the new modem gets here soon.

Agent: Absolutely. You should see it Thursday. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day, James.
