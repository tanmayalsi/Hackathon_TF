Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, so my internet just went out completely about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything already, so...

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'll definitely help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And what's the best name to have on the account?

Customer: It's James Martinez.

Agent: Great, James. Thanks for that. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago, and you've already tried unplugging your equipment. That's a good first step. Let me pull up your account here... (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your account is active. Can you tell me a little more about what you're experiencing? Are all your lights on the modem completely off, or are some of them lit up?

Customer: Yeah, so the lights were going crazy at first—like blinking red and stuff—and then they all just went dark. Nothing's on right now.

Agent: Okay, so no lights on the modem at all. That typically means there's no power getting to it. The modem you have... let me check what model that is in the system... (typing sounds) Okay, so you should have the white Frontier Gateway unit. Is that what you have?

Customer: Um, yeah, I think so. It's white and kind of rectangular. Pretty standard looking.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, so let's check the power cable. Can you follow that cable from the modem and see where it's plugged in? Is it connected to a wall outlet or a power strip?

Customer: (pause) It's... okay, I'm looking at it now. It's plugged into a power strip under my desk.

Agent: Got it. Can you check if that power strip is turned on? Sometimes they have an on/off switch.

Customer: Oh, hold on. (pause) Yeah, okay, the power strip is off. Let me turn it on... (pause) Okay, it's on now.

Agent: Great! Do you see any lights coming back on on the modem?

Customer: (pause) Um... no, actually. Nothing yet. Should I wait a second?

Agent: Yeah, give it about thirty seconds to power up. The modem usually takes a little time to boot.

Customer: (pause) Okay... still nothing. This is weird.

Agent: Hmm, alright. Let me ask you something—when you turned the power strip back on, did you hear or see anything? Any sounds or lights from the modem?

Customer: No, nothing. It's completely dead.

Agent: Okay, let's try this. Can you unplug the power cable from the modem itself this time, wait about ten seconds, and then plug it back in directly? But try plugging it into a wall outlet instead of the power strip if you can.

Customer: (pause, sound of things being moved) Okay, yeah, I'm unplugging it now... (pause) Alright, I'm waiting... and I'm plugging it back in to the wall outlet. (pause) Should I wait again?

Agent: Yeah, give it the same thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, still... nothing. Still not turning on.

Agent: [inaudible] Okay, I'm going to look at a couple of things on my end. (typing sounds, pause) So I'm checking our service in your area, and everything looks good on our end. There don't appear to be any outages reported in your neighborhood.

Customer: Great, so... what do I do?

Agent: Well, there are a couple of possibilities here. The modem could have an internal power issue, or there might be a problem with the power adapter itself. Um, do you happen to have another power outlet you could try? Maybe in a different room?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me try the living room outlet. (sound of footsteps, cable being moved) Okay, I've got it plugged in over here now, and... (pause) still nothing. The modem's not turning on.

Agent: Alright. Unfortunately, it's really starting to sound like we might be looking at a hardware issue with the modem itself. Before we go down that road though, let me ask—have there been any recent storms in your area? Any power surges or anything like that?

Customer: Actually, yeah. There was lightning last night. Pretty bad storm came through.

Agent: Ah, okay. That could very well be it. Lightning strikes or power surges can fry the modem. That would explain why it went from blinking lights to nothing all at once.

Customer: So that means it's just broken? Like, completely?

Agent: It's looking that way. The good news is that we can definitely get you a replacement modem. The bad news is that if it's determined to be storm damage, it might not be covered under the standard warranty, but let me explain your options here. We can arrange for a technician to come out and confirm that's what happened, or we could just go ahead and ship you a replacement unit.

Customer: How long would that take? Because I really need my internet back up.

Agent: (typing sounds) If we did a next-day replacement, you'd have it by tomorrow before 5 PM. But here's the thing—if we do next-day, there would be a rush fee, probably around fifty bucks. Otherwise, standard shipping is three to five business days.

Customer: Ugh, I can't wait that long. I need it for work and stuff.

Agent: I totally understand. Let me see what I can do here. (pause) Can you hold for just one second? I want to check something real quick.

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music, approximately 30 seconds)

Agent: Okay, thanks for holding. So I spoke with my supervisor, and because this appears to be weather-related, we can waive the rush fee and get you next-day shipping at no extra charge. How does that sound?

Customer: Really? Okay, yeah, that's... that's actually great. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. So we'll get that set up for you. You should receive an email confirmation within the next few minutes with your shipping details and a tracking number. When the modem arrives, you'll just need to unbox it, plug it in, and it should automatically connect to your account. If you run into any issues setting it up, you can call us back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Okay, so I'll just have it tomorrow?

Agent: Yes, it should arrive by tomorrow evening. And just so you know, the modem you're getting is actually the newer model, so you might notice an improvement in your speeds and WiFi range. It's a nice little bonus.

Customer: Oh, cool. Well, I guess that's something.

Agent: I know it's frustrating to be without internet, but at least you'll be up and running again pretty quickly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and I'm sorry you had to deal with this. We appreciate your business, and I hope you have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye.
