Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm supposed to be working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account for... Robert Chen, is that correct?

Customer: That's me, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 7:30 or so? I tried turning everything off and back on again, you know, the usual thing, but nothing worked.

Agent: Okay, that's a good first step. Let me ask you a few questions here. Do you have power to your modem and router right now?

Customer: Yeah, let me just... (pause) Yeah, both of them are lit up. They've got the lights on and everything.

Agent: Great. And are you seeing any lights that are normally on that are off now? Like, is there a light that indicates your internet connection?

Customer: Hmm, let me look closer. (pause) There's usually a blue light that's on, I think? And, uh... I don't see that one right now. The power lights are on, but that blue one is definitely off.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. That blue light typically indicates that you have an active connection. Let me check our systems to see if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) What's your service address?

Customer: It's 427 Maple Street, Apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 427 Maple. Is that in the 94583 zip code?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported in your area. So let's go ahead and do some troubleshooting. Have you tried power cycling your modem and router yet?

Customer: I did that this morning, but not... I mean, not in a while. Do you want me to do it again?

Agent: Yes, please. Go ahead and unplug the modem first—that's the box that connects directly to your wall outlet. Leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, I'm doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now while that's unplugged, go ahead and unplug the router as well and let both of them sit for thirty seconds.

Customer: Alright. (pause) Both are unplugged now.

Agent: Great. Count to thirty for me, if you don't mind.

Customer: (pause) One, two, three... (continues counting inaudibly) ...twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

Agent: Perfect. Now plug the modem back in first. That's the one that connects to the wall outlet.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Okay, it's back in. I can see the lights coming back up.

Agent: Good. Give that about fifteen seconds to fully boot up. You should see those lights stabilize.

Customer: (pause) Okay, they're all on now.

Agent: Great. Now go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Got it.

Agent: (pause) Alright, give that another thirty seconds or so to boot up completely.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it. The lights are coming back on.

Agent: Perfect. Now, do you have a computer or phone that you can try connecting to the WiFi?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my laptop right here. Let me just... (pause) Okay, I'm trying to connect to my WiFi network.

Agent: What's happening? Are you seeing your network name appear?

Customer: Yeah, I can see it. Let me try to connect... (pause) No, it's not connecting. It keeps asking me for the password, but every time I enter it, it just times out or won't let me through.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to check your modem's signal levels. (pause) Robert, I'm seeing that your modem is showing as online to our network, which is good news. But the signal levels look a bit weak.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. Sometimes it's a line issue, or something could be interfering with the connection. But first, let me try a few more things. Do you know where your modem is located?

Customer: It's over here by the window, actually. I set it up there because that's where the router is.

Agent: Okay. Are there any other electronic devices near the modem? Like, cordless phones, microwaves, anything like that?

Customer: (pause) There's... well, there's a microwave in the kitchen, but that's like ten feet away. And I think there might be a cordless phone around here somewhere.

Agent: Can you try moving the modem away from that window, maybe toward the center of the room? Just as a test. And see if you can spot that cordless phone and move it as well.

Customer: (pause, rustling sounds) Okay, I'm moving the modem now. (pause) It's a bit more toward the middle. And I found the cordless phone. Let me move that too... okay, it's in the other room now.

Agent: Good. Now let's try connecting to your WiFi again.

Customer: (pause) I'm clicking on the network... enter the password... (pause) No, still nothing. Still timing out.

Agent: Alright, let me try a different approach. Let me send a reset command to your modem from here. This should reboot it and hopefully clear out any issues. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm sending that now. Go ahead and give your modem about two minutes to fully reboot.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'll wait. (longer pause) How much longer?

Agent: We're about halfway there. Just a bit more.

Customer: (pause) Alright, still waiting...

Agent: (pause) Okay, you should be good now. What do you see on the modem?

Customer: Um, the lights are back on. They're blinking right now, like they're initializing or something.

Agent: Perfect. That's normal. Give that another thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, they're back to solid now.

Agent: Good. Now try connecting to your WiFi again.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm connecting... (pause) Come on... (longer pause) No, it's still not working. I'm getting the same thing. It connects to the network but I can't actually access the internet.

Agent: (sigh) Okay, I apologize. This is frustrating. Let me check a couple more things. Can you try plugging an ethernet cable directly into the modem if you have one? That'll help me figure out if it's a WiFi issue or a connection issue.

Customer: Um, do I have an ethernet cable? I'm not... I don't think so. I've never used one before.

Agent: No problem. It would be a cable, probably blue or gray, and it would look kind of like a phone cord but thicker. It would plug into the back of the modem.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking around my apartment... I don't think I have one. Is that a problem?

Agent: Not a huge problem, but it would have been helpful. Let me try a couple other things here. (typing sounds) I'm seeing that your modem is still showing those weak signal levels I mentioned. That's definitely unusual. It could indicate a problem with the line coming into your apartment or possibly an issue with the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, how do we fix it?

Agent: (pause) Well, unfortunately, if it's a line issue, that's something we'd need to send a technician out to look at. But before we do that, let me try one more thing. I'm going to reboot your modem one more time, but this time I'm going to run a full diagnostic.

Customer: Okay, do whatever you need to do.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm running that now. This is going to take about three minutes. Your modem is going to reboot again.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it rebooting.

Agent: (longer pause) Okay, the diagnostic is complete. (pause) Robert, I'm seeing some errors in the diagnostic report. There appears to be an issue with the signal coming into your modem from the line. This isn't something I can fix remotely, unfortunately.

Customer: So... what does that mean? What do I do?

Agent: It means we're going to need to send a technician out to your location to investigate the line. They'll be able to check the physical connection and see if there's damage or an issue somewhere.

Customer: (frustrated) Okay... when can they come out?

Agent: Let me check our scheduling here. (typing sounds) I'm showing we have availability tomorrow between 9 AM and noon, or Thursday between 1 PM and 4 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning is better. I'd like to get this fixed as soon as possible.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get you scheduled for tomorrow, 9 AM to noon. A technician will come to your apartment at 427 Maple, Apartment 3B. You'll receive a confirmation call and a text message with the details.

Customer: Okay, I guess that's... that's fine. This is really inconvenient, you know?

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I wish I could get this resolved over the phone for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just make sure someone actually shows up tomorrow, okay?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to add a note to your account about the urgency here. A technician will be out to see you tomorrow morning. Thank you for your patience, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye, Robert. Have a good day.
