# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it fixed. I've got work calls scheduled this afternoon.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847. The phone number, not the account number—I don't have that handy.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. Let me just... there we go. I've got you here. So you're at 4521 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, you're completely without internet access right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely. The modem's not showing any lights or anything. It's just... dark. Totally dead.

Agent: Alright, I see. Before we do any troubleshooting, let me just ask—have you had any recent weather issues out your way? Any storms last night or this morning?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear actually. No storms or anything like that. This kind of came out of nowhere.

Agent: Okay, well let's start with the basics then. I'd like you to unplug your modem from the power outlet for me, and then wait about 30 seconds before plugging it back in.

Customer: Sure, hang on. (pause) Alright, unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, I'm waiting... (pause) Should be about 30 seconds... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and give it a minute or two to boot back up. We should see some lights come on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it. So far... still nothing. Still dark.

Agent: Hmm, still dark? Okay. Let's try something else. Can you check the power cable for me? Make sure it's firmly connected to both the modem and the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me... okay, I'm checking the back of the modem here. (pause) The cable looks pretty secure. Let me try pushing it in a little more... (pause) Nope, same thing. Still no lights.

Agent: Alright. And you mentioned the modem is completely unresponsive right now?

Customer: Right, yeah. Nothing. No lights, no sounds, nothing. I mean, could the modem just be broken?

Agent: It's possible, but let's rule out a few other things first. Do you have any other outlets you could try plugging it into? Sometimes it helps to test a different outlet to see if it's a power issue.

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, there's one right next to it. Let me unplug it and move it over. (pause) Okay, I'm plugging it into this other outlet now... (pause) Still nothing. No lights at all.

Agent: Hmm, okay. And you're sure the outlet itself is working? Like, if you plugged something else into that outlet—like a lamp or something—would it turn on?

Customer: Oh, that's a good point. Let me grab... yeah, I've got a lamp here. (pause) Let me plug it in... (pause) Yeah, the lamp turns on fine, so the outlet's working.

Agent: Okay, good. So we know the outlets are fine. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your service address... Have you experienced any outages recently in your area, or this is the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. Internet's been pretty solid up until today.

Agent: Alright, and just to be thorough—do you see any lights on the back of the modem? Sometimes there are indicator lights I couldn't see from the front. Can you take a quick look?

Customer: (pause) Nope. I'm checking the back, sides, everywhere. There's nothing. It's like it's just... dead.

Agent: Yeah, that does sound like a hardware failure. Before we go down that road though, let me check if there's anything on our end. Let me put you on a quick hold while I check the line status to your address. It should just be a moment.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So I'm checking the line coming to your house and everything appears to be active on our end. The connection is live, so it's not an outage situation.

Customer: So you're saying the problem is with the modem itself?

Agent: It's looking that way, yeah. I mean, based on everything we've tried—the power resets, different outlets—and the fact that we're not seeing any response from the device, it really seems like the modem may have failed. Sometimes power surges or electrical issues can cause that, even if you didn't see a storm.

Customer: Okay, so... what do I do? Can you send me a new one or something?

Agent: Absolutely. We can definitely get you a replacement modem sent out. Let me look at the fastest shipping options we have available. (typing sounds) So depending on where we're shipping from, we can typically get a device to you within 2-3 business days, possibly sooner. In the meantime, unfortunately, you wouldn't have service.

Customer: Two or three days? Seriously? I need internet for work. This is... (pause) Can you expedite it or anything?

Agent: I understand, and I'm sorry. Let me see what we can do. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I can flag this for expedited processing, but I want to be honest with you—two days is about the best we can do from our warehouse. If there's an issue with the current modem... 

Customer: Is there any other option? Like, can I pick one up somewhere?

Agent: That's actually a great question. Let me check if we have any retail locations nearby... (typing sounds, pause) I'm not seeing any Frontier retail locations in your immediate area, unfortunately. You could check with some local electronics stores to see if they carry compatible modems, but I'd want to make sure whatever you get is compatible with our network.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, so basically I'm just out of luck for the next couple days?

Agent: I really wish I had a better answer for you. Let me try one more thing—let me escalate this to our technical team to make absolutely sure we're not missing something. Can I put you on hold one more time while I do that?

Customer: Yeah, okay, I guess.

Agent: Great, thank you. It'll just be a couple minutes.

(hold music plays)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So I talked to our technical lead, and they're agreeing with my assessment. Given that you've ruled out power issues and outlet issues, and there's no outage on our end, the modem appears to be the culprit here.

Customer: [inaudible] ...can't believe this.

Agent: I know, and I'm really sorry. Let me go ahead and process that replacement modem for you right now. I'm going to put a rush on it and we'll get it out today if possible. In the meantime, is there a cell phone plan you could use as a backup? I see some customers tether to their phones in situations like this.

Customer: Yeah, I guess I could do that. It's not ideal, but... better than nothing.

Agent: Right. So I've got the replacement modem ordered for you. You should receive an email confirmation within the next hour with tracking information. I'm going to waive the replacement fee for you given the inconvenience, and I'll add a $15 credit to your account for this service interruption.

Customer: Okay, well... I appreciate that, I guess.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I don't think so. Just... hopefully the modem gets here soon.

Agent: Absolutely. We'll do our best to get it to you as quickly as possible. I've got your cell number on file here, so if there are any updates or if it ships faster than expected, we'll reach out. Thank you for calling Frontier, and again, I'm really sorry for the inconvenience.

Customer: Yeah, thanks for trying anyway. Bye.

Agent: You take care. Bye now.
