Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got a work call in like twenty minutes and I really need to get this figured out.

Agent: Oh man, I understand. That's frustrating. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147... and what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Hartley.

Agent: Perfect, James. Thanks for that. So your internet went down this morning around... what time would you say?

Customer: I dunno, maybe around 8:30 or 9? I came downstairs to work and everything was just... offline. No lights on the router or anything.

Agent: Alright, let's start with the basics here. Can you just walk me over to your equipment? I'm looking at your account and it shows you've got our Fiber gateway.

Customer: Yeah, I'm there now. What do you want me to check?

Agent: Great. So first thing—do you see any lights on the front of the gateway? They should be lit up, usually blue or white.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, no. No lights at all actually. It's completely dark.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. That usually means it's either not getting power or there's an issue with the unit itself. Can you check the power cable for me? Make sure it's firmly connected on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm checking it now... okay, the wall outlet end looks good, and... (rustling sounds) ...the back of the unit looks pretty snug too.

Agent: Good. And just to confirm, is that outlet getting power? Like, do you have anything else plugged into it?

Customer: Uh, actually no, that outlet's only got the gateway. But wait... (pause) ...I can try plugging my phone charger into it real quick to see if it's working.

Agent: That's a good idea, actually.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, the charger is... it's lighting up. So the outlet's fine.

Agent: Alright, so we've got power to the outlet, but the gateway isn't showing any lights. Let me try something. Can you unplug the gateway from the power cable?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Done. It's unplugged.

Agent: Okay, and just give it about ten seconds. This helps reset the device sometimes.

Customer: (pause) Ten seconds... okay.

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: Alright, plugging it back in... (pause) ...nothing. Still completely dark.

Agent: Hmm. No lights coming on at all?

Customer: Nope. Not a single one.

Agent: Okay, that's... (pause) ...that's a little unusual. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your gateway status, and it's actually showing as offline on our network. When exactly did you notice it went down?

Customer: Like I said, this morning. I didn't really check on it right away, so it could've been earlier. But I know for sure it was off when I came down around 8:30.

Agent: And you haven't experienced any power outages or storms in your area overnight?

Customer: Not that I know of, no. Everything else in the house is working fine.

Agent: Let me try one more thing. Do you have a coaxial cable going into the back of the gateway? It's like a thick, threaded cable?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's connected.

Agent: Can you unscrew that just slightly and then screw it back in? Sometimes these connections can get loose.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, I'm... (pause) ...got it unscrewed. Checking it. Doesn't look loose to me, but I'm screwing it back in now. (pause) ...And done.

Customer: Still nothing though. Still dark.

Agent: Yeah, I figured. (pause) Okay, James, at this point it's looking like the gateway itself might've failed. I'm not getting a signal from it on our end, and the power seems to be reaching it, but we're not seeing any life from the device.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like... does that mean I need a new one?

Agent: Unfortunately, yeah, that's what it's looking like. I can definitely get a replacement gateway shipped out to you, but I gotta be honest—it might take a few business days to get here. We've also got locations where you can pick up a loaner device in the meantime if you need internet today.

Customer: (sighs) A few business days? That's... I mean, I really need this today. Can't you just like, send someone out or something?

Agent: I understand, and I wish I could expedite it for you. Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm checking our tech visit availability in your area... (pause) ...we do have same-day availability, but it would come with a service call fee.

Customer: How much are we talking?

Agent: That would be $89 for the emergency same-day visit.

Customer: (pause) Oof. Um... okay, hold on. Let me just try one more time with this thing. (rustling sounds, pause) Maybe if I unplug it and wait longer?

Agent: Sure, we can definitely try that. Go ahead and unplug it again. Let's wait maybe thirty seconds this time.

Customer: (pause, longer pause) Alright, thirty seconds... plugging it back in... (pause) ...and... nope. Still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I was pretty confident it wasn't going to work, but I wanted to give it a shot for you. I'm sorry, James.

Customer: This is really frustrating. Can I ask—is this a known issue with this model or something?

Agent: Not that I'm aware of. These gateways are usually pretty reliable. Sometimes they just fail, you know? Could be a power surge, could just be... bad luck. It happens.

Customer: (pause) Alright, so what are my options? And be real with me—if I do the tech visit today, will they definitely be able to get me working?

Agent: Assuming it is just the gateway—which I'm pretty confident it is—then yeah, they should be able to swap it out and get you back online today.

Customer: Okay, and if I do the loaner thing, how long would that take?

Agent: You could pick that up probably within an hour or two from one of our retail locations. We've got one not too far from your area. And then once your replacement unit comes in, you'd just swap them out and return the loaner.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. I mean... I guess that's better than paying eighty-nine bucks. Where's the nearest location?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, the nearest one to you is on Maple Street... looks like it's about 5 miles from your address. They're open until 6 PM today.

Customer: (pause) It's currently like 9:30, so I've got time. But this is ridiculous. I should've had someone come out.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. If it helps, when you pick up the loaner, our team there can actually help verify that it is indeed the gateway and not something else. And again, once your replacement arrives, it should be a simple swap.

Customer: When will that arrive, you said?

Agent: Based on your location, probably three to five business days.

Customer: (sighs) Okay. You know what, let me just get the loaner. Can you give me the address one more time?

Agent: Absolutely. It's 1247 Maple Street. And if you could just head in and let them know you're picking up a temporary gateway while your replacement is being processed, they'll get you all set up.

Customer: Alright, 1247 Maple. Got it. They're gonna have my name or...?

Agent: Let me just process this loaner for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm getting that set up. Just give them your account number, and they'll have it ready for you.

Customer: (pause) Great. So I'm all set?

Agent: You're all set, James. And I apologize again that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today. I know it's inconvenient.

Customer: Yeah, well. Not your fault I guess. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm gonna head to that location now.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks for calling Frontier, and sorry again for the trouble.

Customer: Yeah, no problem. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
