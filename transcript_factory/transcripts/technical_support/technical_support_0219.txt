Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll see what we can do. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And what's the best name to have on the account?

Customer: It's James. James Mueller.

Agent: Great, James. I've got you here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was approximately?

Customer: Um, yeah, probably around eight o'clock? I went to work from home and tried to log in and... nothing. Just no connection at all.

Agent: Okay, and are you seeing any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, actually. Let me... let me look at it. (background noise) Okay, so the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light, the one that usually blinks? That's... that's off. It's not doing anything.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful information. The fact that the internet light isn't on suggests we might be looking at either a modem issue or possibly a service issue on our end. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the power cable from the back of the modem for me?

Customer: Uh-huh, doing it now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Just leave that unplugged for about thirty seconds, okay? While we wait, I'm also going to check your service status on my end here. (typing sounds) Hmm, that's interesting.

Customer: What? Is something wrong?

Agent: Well, I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, so that's good news. But I am seeing a few service interruptions associated with your line from earlier today. Let's get that modem powered back up and see if that clears it.

Customer: Okay, powering it back on now. (pause) It's on. The power light's back to green.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about two minutes to fully boot up. What I'm gonna do while we wait is I'm gonna check the signal levels coming into your modem. Can you tell me when that internet light starts to blink or turn on?

Customer: (long pause) Okay, it's... it's been like a minute and a half now and... still nothing. The light's still off.

Agent: Hmm, that's not what we're hoping to see. Alright, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not getting a signal from your modem on our system right now, which is odd. Um, can you also check your router? Is that plugged in and powered on?

Customer: Oh, yeah, my router. Let me look at... yeah, it's on. The lights are all on there too. Blue lights blinking.

Agent: Okay, good. So the router's working. Let me try another approach here. James, I want you to unplug the modem again, but this time also unplug the router.

Customer: Both of them?

Agent: Yes, both of them. Let's do a full reset.

Customer: Alright. (background noise) Okay, they're both unplugged now.

Agent: Great. Leave them unplugged for a full minute this time, okay?

Customer: Got it. (pause) This is really frustrating, man. I've got meetings this afternoon and I'm trying to prep for them.

Agent: I completely understand, James. We'll get you back online. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first, and then wait about thirty seconds before you plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) Modem's back in. Waiting... okay, router's plugged back in now.

Agent: Good. Let's give it about three minutes to fully boot up and reconnect. What I'm seeing on my end... actually, hold on just one second. (pause) I'm looking at your line again and I'm seeing some signal degradation that might be causing this. Let me place you on a brief hold while I check with our technical team to see if there's anything we need to do on our infrastructure side. Should only be about two minutes, okay?

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent: (hold music plays for approximately 90 seconds)

Agent: Thank you for holding, James. Alright, so I spoke with our team and there doesn't appear to be any infrastructure issues affecting your service. I want to try one more thing on your end. Are you still there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here. And, um, still no internet light.

Agent: Okay, unfortunately it sounds like we might be dealing with a hardware issue with your modem. I want to ask you a few questions. How long have you had your current modem with us?

Customer: (pause) I don't know, maybe... three years? Maybe four?

Agent: Alright, and have you had any issues with it before or is this the first time?

Customer: No, it's been pretty solid. Just worked fine until today.

Agent: Right. Well, I'm going to be honest with you, after all these troubleshooting steps, I'm pretty confident that we're looking at a modem failure. The signal's not reaching it on our end, the internet light won't come on even after multiple resets, and your router is functioning normally, which tells me the issue is isolated to the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? How do I fix it?

Agent: Well, there are a couple of options. We can get you a replacement modem shipped out, but that's typically going to take five to seven business days. However, if you're in an area with one of our local service centers, you might be able to pick one up today or tomorrow.

Customer: I can't wait five to seven days. I need internet for work. Can you... can someone come out to my house?

Agent: Let me check that for you. (typing sounds) (pause) Unfortunately, a technician visit for modem replacement would come with a service call fee of around seventy-five dollars, and they'd typically have availability sometime in the next two to three days.

Customer: [inaudible] This is unbelievable. So my options are either wait a week, pay seventy-five bucks for someone to come here, or go pick it up myself?

Agent: I understand your frustration, James. Those are your main options. Let me tell you what—I'm going to note on your account that you experienced this service interruption this morning, and I'm going to make sure we waive the service call fee if you decide to go that route. That way it's just the technician time without the extra charge.

Customer: Okay, well... I appreciate that, I guess. Let me check where your nearest service center is. Is it close to here? I'm up in the Riverside area.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me pull that up. Looks like we have a location about eight miles from you. They're open until six p.m. today if you want to try to get there.

Customer: Yeah, let me check if I can make that work. I might be able to swing by on my lunch break.

Agent: That would definitely be your fastest solution. And like I said, I'm gonna take off that service fee for you. I'll make a note that it's a courtesy waiver for the modem replacement, okay?

Customer: Yeah, alright. I appreciate that. Can you give me the address?

Agent: Absolutely. (pause) It's 4521 Mission Boulevard, suite 110. That's in Riverside.

Customer: Got it. 4521 Mission Boulevard. Is that... do I need an appointment or can I just walk in?

Agent: You should be able to walk in during business hours, but I'd recommend calling ahead just to make sure they have a modem in stock. The number is 555-0198.

Customer: Okay, I'll do that. Thanks for all your help, Derek, even if we couldn't fix it over the phone.

Agent: Of course, James. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve it remotely. Once you get that modem swapped out and plugged in, you should be back up and running immediately. If you have any issues after that, please don't hesitate to give us a call back. We're here twenty-four seven.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
