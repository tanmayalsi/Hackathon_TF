Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that, sir. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at... account for David Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you're located in... Las Vegas, Nevada?

Customer: Correct.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned the internet went out about an hour ago. Just to clarify, are you seeing any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, let me look. The modem has... yeah, the power light is on, but I'm not seeing the internet light. It's usually solid blue and right now it's just... not there.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. And you've already tried unplugging the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I unplugged it for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, let me try a couple things on my end first. (pause) I'm going to run a line test here... (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm not seeing any issues with the line coming into your home. That's actually a good sign. Let's do a couple more troubleshooting steps. Can you tell me—is your router a separate device or is it all in one unit?

Customer: It's separate. I have the modem and then a router that's plugged into it.

Agent: Perfect. And is that router powered on right now?

Customer: Uh, yeah, it should be. Let me just... yeah, the light's on. The power light is on but I'm not seeing the usual lights that indicate it's connected.

Agent: Got it. So what I'd like you to do is unplug both devices—both the modem and the router. Let's do a full reset. Unplug them, wait about two minutes, and then plug the modem back in first. We'll let that sit for a minute, and then plug the router back in. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I can do that now. (sounds of movement) Okay, they're both unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we're waiting, can I ask... have you had any recent storms in your area or any power fluctuations?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine this morning and then boom, it just stopped.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. (pause) Go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay, it's in.

Agent: Alright, we're going to give that about sixty seconds to boot up fully. What you should see is... the power light will come on first, then you should see other lights start to activate. There should be internet, upload, download indicators.

Customer: Okay, I'm watching it now. (pause) Yeah, the power light's on... and... I'm seeing another light now, looks like it's... it's yellowish?

Agent: Yellow? Hmm, that's... okay. Yellow typically means it's still in startup mode or trying to establish a connection. Let's give it another thirty seconds or so. (pause) Any changes?

Customer: It's still yellow. Um... maybe a little dimmer now?

Agent: Okay, let's go ahead and plug in the router while we wait.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) It's plugged in. (pause) Okay, so the modem light is still that same yellow color.

Agent: Alright. Let's give it a full minute to establish the connection. (longer pause) How's it looking?

Customer: Same thing. It's just... yellow.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, I'm not entirely sure what's causing that yet. Let me check something on my backend. (typing sounds) So I'm looking at your account and I'm not showing any outages in your area. The line test I ran came back normal. That usually means the issue is either with the modem or router itself, or possibly the connection between them. Have you noticed any burning smell or anything unusual coming from the devices?

Customer: No, nothing like that. They feel normal temperature-wise too.

Agent: Good, that's a good sign. Let me try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? There should be a small reset button on the back. You'll need a paperclip or something small to press it. Hold it in for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me find the button. I'll need to move this... yeah, I found it. (sound of pressing, beeping sounds) Okay, I pressed it.

Agent: Alright, and now we'll let it sit for a couple minutes while it goes through the reset process.

Customer: (longer pause) Okay, it's been a couple minutes. I'm seeing... it's still the same yellow light. Is that... is that normal?

Agent: (pause) No, actually, that's not quite what we'd want to see. Ideally we should be seeing the modem fully boot up with all the lights coming on. The yellow light indicates it's in a kind of holding pattern. Let me see here... (typing sounds) Have you had any recent weather issues, power surges, anything like that in the past week or so?

Customer: Not that I can think of, no.

Agent: Okay. (pause) I'm wondering if this might be a hardware issue with the modem itself. Um, let me try a couple more things before we go down that road. Can you tell me the model number on the modem? It should be on the sticker on the back or bottom.

Customer: (sound of movement) Let me flip it around. It says... FR-G329... something. The rest is kind of worn off.

Agent: The FR-G329, okay. That's one of our standard units. (typing) Alright, I'm pulling up the specifications for that. (pause) I'm seeing that this model should have those lights fully illuminated within two to three minutes of power-up. Since it's been longer than that and we're still seeing just the yellow light, I'm becoming more concerned that there may be an internal issue with the modem.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you... can you fix it remotely or do I need to...?

Agent: That's a great question. Unfortunately, if it is a hardware issue, I wouldn't be able to fix it remotely. What I would recommend is we set you up with a replacement unit, and we can expedite that to you. Most of our replacements arrive within two to three business days.

Customer: Two or three days? I need internet before that. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm really sorry about this situation. Um, let me see what options we have. (pause, typing sounds) So here's what I can do. I can flag this as a priority replacement, which might get it to you by next business day if we process it right now. In the meantime, is there anywhere you'd be able to work from temporarily? A coffee shop, library, or...?

Customer: I mean, I could probably go to the library, but I really need this resolved at my home. Can't you send someone out here?

Agent: I wish I could expedite a technician visit. Unfortunately, with the hardware failure it's typically more efficient to go with the modem replacement first. If there's still an issue after that, we can absolutely schedule a tech visit. But I'm pretty confident that once we get you a new modem, you'll be back up and running.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) This is really not ideal. When can we send this out?

Agent: I can process that replacement right now. Let me just... (typing sounds) ...submit this for you. (pause) Okay, so I've got this marked for expedited replacement. Can I confirm the best address for shipping? It's... 4847 Maple Street, Las Vegas, Nevada 89123?

Customer: Yeah, that's it.

Agent: Perfect. You should receive a tracking number via email and text within the next couple hours. And again, with the expedited status, we're looking at arrival by next business day. In the meantime, if you want to do any troubleshooting on your end, you're welcome to, but I suspect that yellow light is going to persist until we get that new modem to you.

Customer: Alright. (pause) So I just... sit around with no internet until then?

Agent: I know it's not ideal, and I'm really sorry about that. You might consider going to a coffee shop or library if you absolutely need connectivity in the meantime. And if there's anything else I can help you with, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Okay. Fine. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: No, you're all set. Just keep an eye out for that tracking number, and once you receive the modem, the setup should be pretty straightforward. Just plug it in and it should automatically pair with your router. But if you run into any issues once it arrives, feel free to give us a call back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Alright, I'll do that.

Agent: Thank you so much for your patience today, and I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved immediately. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thanks for calling Frontier Communications. We appreciate your business, and we'll get you back online as soon as we can. Have a great day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Thank you.
