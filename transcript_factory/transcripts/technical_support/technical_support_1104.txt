# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yes, hi. So I'm having issues with my internet. It's just... it's completely down right now and I need it working ASAP.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's area code 503, then 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm showing an account here under the name... is this Michael Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage. When did this start happening?

Customer: Um, about an hour ago. I was working from home, everything was fine, and then suddenly the connection just dropped. I restarted my router like three times already and nothing's working.

Agent: Okay, I appreciate you doing that already. That's a good first step. Let me ask you a few questions here. Do you have any lights on your modem right now? Are they lit up or blinking?

Customer: (pause) Let me look at it. So... the power light is on, it's solid green. But I'm not seeing... I don't think the internet light is on. It's not blinking or anything.

Agent: Okay, so the internet light is off. That actually tells us something. Let me have you try something for me. Can you unplug the modem from power and wait about 30 seconds?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (sound of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged now.

Agent: Great. Just let that sit for about 30 seconds while we're talking. So you mentioned you've restarted your router as well. Is that a separate device or is that combined with your modem?

Customer: Oh, no, it's separate. Yeah, I have the modem and then I have my own router connected to it.

Agent: Perfect, that's helpful to know. Okay, 30 seconds should be about up. Go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let's give that a moment to boot back up. While we're waiting, let me just ask—have you experienced any recent storms in your area? Any service disruptions?

Customer: No, actually it's been pretty clear out all morning. The weather's fine.

Agent: Okay, good. (typing sounds) Michael, are you seeing any lights coming back on the modem now?

Customer: Yeah, the power light came back on, it's still green. And um... okay, I'm waiting for the internet light. (pause) ...I'm still not seeing it come back on. That's weird. Usually it comes back pretty quick.

Agent: Right, that is unusual. Let me have you check something else for me. Can you look at where your cable is plugged in on the modem? The coaxial cable coming in from the wall?

Customer: The coaxial cable, yeah... (pause) It looks fine to me. It's plugged in pretty tight.

Agent: Okay. And it's the same cable that was working this morning when you started your day?

Customer: Yeah, I haven't touched anything. I swear, nothing was changed.

Agent: I believe you. Let me try to access your modem remotely here. (typing sounds) Can you give me just one moment? (pause) Okay, I'm not able to establish a connection to your modem remotely, which confirms what we're seeing on our end. We're actually showing no signal coming from your address.

Customer: No signal? What does that mean? Is it your guys' equipment or... is it on my end?

Agent: That's a good question. It could be a few things. It could be an issue with the line coming into your house, or it could be an issue on our network in your area. Let me put you on a quick hold while I check our system for any outages or line issues in your neighborhood. Should only take about a minute or two.

Customer: Okay, yeah, do that.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Thanks for hanging on, Michael. I've checked our network status and I'm not showing any widespread outages in your area, which means this is likely isolated to your line. Let me ask you this—do you have a flashlight handy?

Customer: A flashlight? Um, yeah, I do. Why?

Agent: I want to have you go outside and check your service box on the outside of your home. It might be gray or white, usually mounted on the side of the house or sometimes at the front. Can you do that?

Customer: Alright, hold on. (background noise of moving around, door opening) Okay, I'm outside. Yeah, I can see it. It's on the side here.

Agent: Great. Can you look and see if all the connections are tight? Sometimes connection issues can happen if [inaudible]... if there's any corrosion or looseness.

Customer: (background noise) I'm looking at it now. There's one connection that looks... I mean, it looks pretty corroded actually. It's got like a white stuff on it. Is that the problem?

Agent: That could definitely be contributing. Try gently disconnecting that, okay? Just give it a slight twist counter-clockwise and see if you can remove it.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I'm... (pause) got it off. There's definitely a lot of corrosion on here.

Agent: I see. Can you try cleaning it off a bit? Do you have like a dry cloth or maybe a pencil eraser?

Customer: I've got an eraser. Let me just... (pause) ...rub it off here. (sound of rubbing) Okay, that's a little better. Should I put it back?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and reattach it. Just twist it back on clockwise, nice and snug.

Customer: (pause) Alright, twisted it back on. Should I go inside and check the modem again?

Agent: Actually, you know what, let me check our system in real time here. (typing sounds) (long pause) I'm still not seeing a signal coming through on our end, Michael. And I'm going to be honest with you, the corrosion might be part of the issue, but even after cleaning it, we're still not registering any signal from your address.

Customer: So... that doesn't mean it's fixed?

Agent: Unfortunately no. It looks like the issue might be on our infrastructure side. This could be a problem with the line running to your house or somewhere on our main line in your neighborhood. Have you had any construction work done in your area recently?

Customer: Not that I know of. I mean, I haven't seen anything going on.

Agent: Okay. Well, based on what I'm seeing here, I think we need to get a technician out to your location to diagnose this properly. They can check both your external connection and our line coming to your house.

Customer: A technician? How long is that going to take? I really need my internet back today if possible. I'm supposed to be working.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) The earliest I'm showing is... tomorrow afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... that's not ideal, but I guess if that's what we need to do. Can he come earlier in the day or...?

Agent: Unfortunately that's our next available slot. But I can note here that this is a priority and you're working from home, so if a slot opens up earlier, we'll definitely try to get you in.

Customer: Alright, okay. I guess I'll take the afternoon slot tomorrow.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. You should receive a confirmation text and email here within the next few minutes at the contact information we have on file. The technician will arrive sometime between 1 and 5 PM tomorrow. Does your address show as 4521 Oakwood Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. (typing sounds) And just to confirm, is there anything else I can help troubleshoot in the meantime, or would you like to try anything else right now?

Customer: No, I don't think so. I mean, I guess there's nothing really left to try at this point, right?

Agent: Unfortunately, I have to agree with you. The fact that we're not seeing any signal on our end tells me this really does need an in-person inspection. But I want you to know we're going to get this resolved. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just really hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sure they will. I'm sorry you've had this trouble today. Your case reference number is 8847-FRN-X if you need to reference anything. Thanks for choosing Frontier, Michael, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, thanks Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
