Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I need to get this fixed pretty soon.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up here... Perfect, I've got your account. It looks like you're on our Fiber 500 plan. And you're saying your internet went down this morning?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around nine or so. I was working from home and everything just... stopped. The modem's still lit up and stuff, but nothing's connecting.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me ask you a few questions real quick. Are you seeing any lights on the modem right now?

Customer: Um, yeah. There's... let me see. There's a white light on the front, and I think there's a green one on the side?

Agent: Good, good. So the power is on. That's a start. Now, do you see an internet light? It's usually labeled "Internet" or sometimes it says "WAN." It might be red, amber, or off.

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) Yeah, I see one. It's red. Is that bad?

Agent: That could mean a few things. It might indicate a connection issue. Before we go further, let me just run a quick line check on our end here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm checking our network in your area... Hmm, I'm not seeing any reported outages on your street. Everything looks normal on our side.

Customer: Really? So it's just my modem then?

Agent: Well, it could be a few different things. Let's try a couple of troubleshooting steps. First, can you locate the power cable on your modem?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and unplug that for me. Just pull it right out of the back.

Customer: (pause) Done. Should I wait?

Agent: Yeah, let's wait about thirty seconds. Just count it out.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, that should be about thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugging back in. (pause) Alright, the lights are coming back on.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait for it to fully boot up. It should take about two minutes. You'll know it's done when those lights stabilize.

Customer: (pause, background noise of tapping) Okay, yeah... so they seem pretty stable now. Still seeing that red internet light though.

Agent: Okay, still red. Alright, let's try a different approach. Do you have a computer or phone you can try connecting to right now? Just to test the connection?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my laptop right here. Let me... (pause) Okay, I'm trying to connect to the WiFi network. It's showing up, but it's saying... wait, it's saying I need a password or it won't connect.

Agent: Ah, okay. So the WiFi is broadcasting but you're having trouble connecting?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. Or... actually, wait. Maybe I'm just putting the wrong password in. Let me try again... (pause, typing sounds) No, same thing. It's just saying "can't connect to this network."

Agent: Alright, let me try something else. Can you check if there's a cable going from your modem to a router? Or is it all one unit?

Customer: It's... it looks like it's all one unit actually. Just the modem.

Agent: Okay, that's what I thought. So we've got an all-in-one modem and router. Let me check your account here... (typing sounds, pause) I'm seeing that your modem was provisioned correctly. Hmm. Okay, let's try a factory reset. Are you familiar with how to do that?

Customer: Uh, not really, no.

Agent: No problem. On the back of your modem, there should be a small button, kind of recessed. It might be labeled "Reset." Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Hold on, let me... yeah, I think I see it. It's like a tiny button?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Using something like a paperclip or a pen, we're going to press and hold that button for about ten seconds. This will reset the modem to factory settings.

Customer: Okay, I'm gonna get a paperclip... (sounds of drawers opening and closing) Alright, I've got one. (pause) Okay, pressing it... (pause) How long did you say?

Agent: About ten seconds. So just keep holding it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, one more second... (pause) Alright, letting go. Now what?

Agent: Now the modem's going to restart. It's going to take a couple minutes again. But this time, once it comes back up, you'll need to set up your WiFi network again because it's been reset to factory defaults.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... (pause, background noise) Alright, lights are back on again. But that red internet light is still... still red.

Agent: (pause) Still red. Okay, that's... that's actually telling me that there might be a bigger issue here. Let me check something. (typing sounds, longer pause) I'm looking at our system, and I want to make sure I'm reading this right. Are you able to see a physical connection on the back of your modem? Like, is there an ethernet cable plugged into the port that says "WAN" or "Internet"?

Customer: Hmm, let me look... (pause) I don't think anything's plugged in back there except the power cable. Is something supposed to be?

Agent: Ah, okay. Well, that could be part of it, but actually, with your Fiber plan, you should have a fiber optic line coming into your home. Let me ask you—do you remember if a technician installed this modem for you, or did you set it up yourself?

Customer: No, no, they installed it. The tech came out like six months ago.

Agent: Right, so they should have run the fiber line. Can you maybe check around the modem and see if there's like a thin fiber cable? It might be in a protective tube?

Customer: (pause, background noise) I'm looking... I don't see anything like that. Actually, wait. There is... there's something that looks kinda like a cable but it's not plugged into anything. It's just sitting on the shelf next to the modem.

Agent: Oh! Okay, that might be it. It sounds like it might have come loose. Can you pick that up and try plugging it into the modem? It should fit into the port on the back marked with like a circle or a light bulb symbol.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm trying to... (pause) Alright, I got it. I'm gonna plug this end in. (pause) It's not... it's not really going in smoothly.

Agent: Okay, don't force it. Sometimes they can be a little tricky. Just take your time, make sure it's aligned properly.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, I think I got it. It's in now. (pause) Oh! Oh wow, the red light just turned... it's amber now? Is that better?

Agent: That's actually good progress! That usually means it's recognizing the connection. Let's wait and see if it turns green.

Customer: (pause) Okay, we're waiting... (long pause) It's... it's still amber. How long should it take?

Agent: It shouldn't take too long. Usually within a minute or two. (pause) Still amber?

Customer: Yeah, still amber. This is taking a while.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm checking the provisioning on my end again. Sometimes after a reset, the system needs to re-authenticate the modem. Let me see... (pause) I'm pushing a reprovision command through right now.

Customer: (pause) What does that mean?

Agent: It's basically telling our system to re-register your modem. It should kick in pretty quick. (pause) How's that light looking now?

Customer: (pause) Still amber. Maybe a little dimmer? Or I don't know, maybe I'm imagining that.

Agent: (pause) Okay, and you still can't connect to the WiFi network?

Customer: Right, no WiFi showing up at all now, actually. I think the reset might have cleared that.

Agent: Yeah, that's expected. Once we get this connection stabilized, we'll get you connected to the WiFi again. (pause, typing sounds) I'm still waiting for the system to reprovision on this end. This is taking a bit longer than usual, which... (pause) which is a little unusual.

Customer: So something's definitely wrong then?

Agent: Well, there are a few possibilities. It could be the fiber line itself, it could be our equipment on the network side, or it could be something with the modem still. But that amber light tells me we're making some kind of connection. I just need to figure out why it's not going fully green. (pause) I'm going to try a couple more things on my end here. Have you had any recent outages or service interruptions?

Customer: Not that I know of. Everything was fine yesterday.

Agent: Okay. (typing sounds, pause) I'm going to transfer this over to our technical support team. They have additional tools I don't have access to, and I think they might be able to dig deeper into what's happening on the line. But before I do that, let me get you set up so we can make sure they have all your information.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Do I need to stay on the phone with them too?

Agent: You will, yes. They may ask you to try a few more things or run some diagnostics. It'll probably take another fifteen or twenty minutes, but they're really good at troubleshooting these kinds of issues. Just stay on the line here and I'll connect you right over. Just give me one second... (pause, hold music, pause) Okay, I'm going to put you through now. Thanks so much for your patience.

(Transfer sounds)

Technical Support Agent: Hi there, thanks for holding. I'm Jennifer with Frontier Technical Support. I see you're having trouble with your internet connection. Can you tell me what's going on?

Customer: Yeah, so my internet went down this morning. We did a factory reset and now the internet light on the modem is amber but not green, and I can't connect to WiFi or anything.

Technical Support Agent: Okay, got it. So the light's been stuck on amber for how long now?

Customer: (pause) Maybe five minutes?

Technical Support Agent: Alright. And you're definitely seeing that fiber cable connected to the modem?

Customer: Yeah, it's plugged in.

Technical Support Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now, and I'm seeing the modem is trying to sync but it's not fully authenticating. I'm going to run a line test real quick. (pause, typing sounds) I'm testing the fiber line to your location... (longer pause) Hmm. Okay, so I'm seeing some signal degradation on the line. The levels are lower than they should be.

Customer: Is that bad?

Technical Support Agent: It could indicate an issue with the fiber line itself, or possibly a connection point. It might be a loose connection somewhere between our network and your house, or there could be an issue with the line. Given what I'm seeing, I think we need to send a technician out to do a physical inspection and check the line. There might be something with the fiber connection that I can't diagnose remotely.

Customer: Oh, man. How soon can someone come out?

Technical Support Agent: Let me check our schedule... (typing sounds) The earliest I have available is... tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Really? I mean, I guess it has to. Can I get that confirmed?

Technical Support Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to schedule that for you right now. (typing sounds) Alright, you're all set. Technician will be out tomorrow afternoon. You'll get a call about an hour before they arrive. Is that phone number still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Technical Support Agent: Perfect. In the meantime, don't try anything else with the modem, okay? Just leave it as is. The technician will take it from there tomorrow. I really apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Yeah, well... I guess I'll just hope they can fix it tomorrow. Thanks for trying at least.

Technical Support Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't get you up and running right away. We'll get this sorted tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Technical Support Agent: Alright, have a good rest of your day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
