Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet went out this morning and I've been trying to figure out what's going on, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account here for... is this 2447 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you're experiencing a complete outage? No internet at all?

Customer: Right, nothing. The modem's been on since this morning, and I've rebooted it like three times already. I work from home, so this is... it's kind of a big deal right now.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me just run a quick line test on your account. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm not seeing any outages in your area. That's actually good news because it means we should be able to troubleshoot this. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Like, what does your modem look like?

Customer: Uh, well, it's got this red light on it. Just solid red. It's not doing the usual blinking thing.

Agent: Okay, the solid red light typically indicates either a connection issue or a problem with the device itself. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just completely unplug it from the power outlet.

Customer: (background noise of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds while it powers down completely. I'm just gonna... (pause) ...just stay on the line with me, okay?

Customer: Yeah, no problem. I'm here. (long pause) So how long have you been with Frontier?

Agent: Oh, uh, about four years now. Anyway, is it been thirty seconds?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I think so. Maybe a little more.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in, and let's wait for it to fully boot up. That should take about two to three minutes. You'll know it's ready when you see the green lights.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Okay, it's plugging back in. (pause) Alright, so I'm waiting... it's still red.

Agent: Still red?

Customer: Yeah, it's still just... solid red.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let's give it another minute or so. Sometimes these take a little longer. (pause) (typing sounds) While we're waiting, let me ask you—did anything change with your setup recently? New computer, router, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. It's been working fine for like six months. This just happened out of nowhere this morning.

Agent: Right, right. Okay, how's the modem looking now?

Customer: Still red. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, let's try something else. Can you check the cables for me? Can you see where the fiber line comes in?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I think so. It's in the back of my entertainment center. (background noise of moving things) There's like a white cable...

Agent: Okay, so you're looking at the coaxial cable or the fiber line?

Customer: I... I'm not totally sure. It's white. It's plugged into the back of the modem.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Can you just make sure it's firmly connected? Sometimes these can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... it looks pretty tight to me. I'm pushing on it and it doesn't move or anything.

Agent: Good. Okay, and then on your modem, can you see if there's a reset button? Usually it's a small button that's kind of recessed...

Customer: A reset button? (pause) I see... yeah, there's a little hole here on the bottom.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to have you press that, but I want to warn you—this will completely reset your modem, so you're gonna lose any custom settings you might have configured. Are you okay with that?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I just need internet. Do whatever you gotta do.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and use a pen or a paperclip, hold that button down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... holding it... (pause) ...it's doing something. The lights are changing.

Agent: Good sign. Let's see what happens now. Go ahead and let go.

Customer: (pause) It's... it's going through some kind of startup sequence. There's like a blue light now, which is different. (pause) But... okay, it went back to red.

Agent: (pause) Back to red, huh?

Customer: Yeah, it's red again. I don't... I don't know what that means.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, that's... that's a little unusual. The reset should have helped if it was just a software glitch. The fact that we're still seeing that red light suggests there might be a hardware issue, or... let me check something here. (pause) Have you noticed any storms or anything like that in your area recently?

Customer: Uh, actually, yeah. There was a pretty bad storm last night. Like, really windy. Power flickered a couple times.

Agent: Ah, okay. That could be it. Lightning strikes can damage the modem or the outside equipment. Let me pull up your service location here. (typing sounds) Do me a favor—can you go look at where the fiber line enters your home from outside? Is there a box or any equipment on the exterior of your house?

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, there's like... a gray box on the side of the house. Near the corner.

Agent: Okay, can you take a look at it and tell me if anything looks damaged? Any scorch marks or burns?

Customer: (pause) [inaudible] ...no, it looks... I mean, it looks okay to me. Nothing's obviously burned or anything.

Agent: Alright. And the lights on that box—are there any lights on it? What do they look like?

Customer: (long pause) Uh... I don't see any lights on it. It's just... it's just a gray box. I don't think it has lights.

Agent: Okay. (pause) I'm gonna be honest with you—based on what we've tried here, I think the issue might be on the network side or potentially a damaged modem from that storm. At this point, I think we need to escalate this to our technical support team, or we might need to send a technician out to your location. Let me just verify a few more things. Can you tell me... when exactly did the internet stop working? Was it immediately after the storm, or this morning?

Customer: Uh, I didn't really notice until I got up this morning. I had already gone to bed when the storm was happening, so... it could have been last night, I guess.

Agent: Right. Okay, and you haven't seen any other issues? Like your TV service or phone?

Customer: Oh, actually, no—my TV's working fine. The phone... I'm not sure. I don't really use the landline much.

Agent: Okay, so just the internet is affected. (pause) Alright, well, here's what I think we should do. I can schedule a technician to come out to your house and diagnose the issue. They'll be able to check all the external equipment and the modem itself, and if it's something that needs to be replaced, we can take care of that. Does that work for you?

Customer: How soon can they come out? Like, I need this fixed today if possible. I have meetings this afternoon.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. (pause) I'm looking at our schedule for today, and... (pause) it looks like our next available appointment in your area would be... tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. 

Customer: (sigh) Tomorrow? Can't they come sooner?

Agent: I'm really sorry, but that's the earliest I'm seeing. We do have some emergency slots, but those are typically reserved for complete service outages affecting multiple customers. (pause) I can put you on a list for a same-day appointment, but I can't guarantee anything.

Customer: No, I mean... I guess tomorrow is fine. It's not ideal, but... okay.

Agent: I really appreciate your patience. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, so I have you down for tomorrow, and the window is between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will give you a call about an hour before they arrive. Your reference number is 8847-FJ. Have you got something to write that down?

Customer: Yeah, 8847-FJ. Okay, I got it.

Agent: Perfect. And is there anything else I can help you with while we're at it?

Customer: Uh, no, I think that's it. I just... I hope they can fix it.

Agent: I'm sure they'll be able to help. If you need anything before the appointment, feel free to give us a call back. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Alright, thanks, Marcus.

Agent: Have a good day.
