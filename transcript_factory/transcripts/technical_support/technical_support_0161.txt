Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been trying to figure it out for like two hours now. I really need to get this working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan in the Riverside area. And you're saying your internet is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely. Like, no connection at all. The modem's been on the whole time, but nothing's working.

Agent: Okay, got it. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your modem right now? Just describe what you see for me.

Customer: Um... okay, so there's a power light that's on, it's white or blue or something. And then there's like a... I don't know, a green light that keeps blinking?

Agent: Okay, good. So the power light is on and you're seeing a green blinking light. That's actually a normal indicator that the modem is trying to connect. Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in yet?

Customer: No, I haven't actually. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, definitely. Go ahead and unplug the modem from the power outlet. Wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. I'll be right here on the line with you.

Customer: (pause, sound of movement) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. I'm just gonna wait a few seconds...

Agent: Take your time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been about thirty seconds. Plugging it back in now. (pause) Alright, I see the lights coming back on.

Agent: Great. So give it about a minute or two to fully restart. While we're waiting, let me ask—do you have a separate router, or are you using the modem-router combo unit?

Customer: I have a separate router. It's sitting right next to the modem.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Let me know once the modem has settled down and the lights stabilize. What color is the internet or connection light right now?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... the modem light is still blinking green. It's been like a minute now. Shouldn't it be solid by now?

Agent: Hmm, that's unusual. A blinking green light for that long usually means it's still trying to establish a connection. Let me check a couple things on my end. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area, so that's good news. Have you noticed any changes to your setup recently? New equipment or anything?

Customer: No, nothing. It was working fine yesterday. I turned everything off before I went to bed, and this morning nothing would come back on... well, the modem came on, but not the internet.

Agent: Understood. Okay, so let's try one more thing. Can you check the cables for me? I want to make sure everything is plugged in securely. Check the power cable to the modem, and also the fiber optic cable coming into your unit. Do you know which one is the fiber line?

Customer: Uh... yeah, I think so. There's like a thicker cable that comes from outside the house. That's the fiber, right?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Can you make sure that's pushed in all the way? Sometimes they can come loose.

Customer: (pause, sounds of movement) Okay, I'm checking it now. It feels pretty tight to me, but let me just push it in a little more to be sure. (pause) Yeah, it's snug. I don't think that's the issue.

Agent: Alright. And the modem light—is it still blinking green?

Customer: Yeah, still blinking. It's been like three minutes now.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at this from my side and I'm not seeing your modem come online. That blinking green light usually means it's not getting a signal from the network. Um... (typing sounds) Let me try a couple things here. Can you tell me—when you look at the back of the modem, do you see any lights that are red or orange at all?

Customer: No, everything looks green or white. Why, is that bad?

Agent: Not necessarily bad, but it would give us more information. The fact that nothing is red is actually good. It means the modem isn't detecting an error state. But that green blinking light... (pause) Let me try resetting the modem to factory settings. This will erase your settings, so I'll have to reconfigure it, but it might help.

Customer: Okay, um... how do I do that?

Agent: On the back of the modem, there should be a small reset button. You'll need something thin like a paperclip. Press and hold that button for about fifteen seconds while the modem is powered on.

Customer: (pause, sounds of rustling) Okay, I'm looking at the back now. I see it, yeah. It's a tiny button. (pause) Alright, I'm holding it down... counting the seconds... (pause) Okay, I've been holding it for like twenty seconds. I'm letting go now.

Agent: Good. Now the modem should restart. Give it about two to three minutes to fully boot up and initialize.

Customer: (pause) Okay. So we're just waiting?

Agent: Yeah, we're just waiting. I know this is frustrating. While we wait, let me check if there's anything else I should know. Have you had any issues with your service recently, or is this completely out of the blue?

Customer: No, honestly, it's been working great for like six months or so. This is the first time anything's gone wrong.

Agent: That's good to know. (pause, typing sounds) Alright, so I'm checking our network on my end and... hmm... I'm still not seeing your modem make a connection. You know what, let me check the ONT—that's the Optical Network Terminal. Do you have a separate ONT box, or is it integrated into your modem?

Customer: I... I'm not sure what that is, honestly.

Agent: That's okay. So, it might be a separate white box somewhere in your house or outside. It could also be combined with your modem. Since you said you have a separate router, you might have a separate ONT as well. Do you see any other networking equipment besides the modem and router?

Customer: (pause, sounds of movement) Let me look around. Um... I don't think so? Just the modem and the router that I can see.

Agent: Okay. Let me ask you this—when the technician originally installed your service, did they mount anything on the outside of your house or in a closet?

Customer: You know, I think there might be something in the garage. I haven't really paid attention to it. Let me go check. (pause) Okay, yeah, there's like a white box mounted on the wall in my garage. That might be it?

Agent: Yes, that's likely the ONT. Can you tell me what lights you see on that box?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so there's... um... let me see... there's like a green light that's solid, and then... a red light? Yeah, definitely a red light.

Agent: A red light. Okay, that's important information. That red light typically indicates an issue with the connection from the ONT to the network. Let me try something. Can you unplug the power to the ONT as well?

Customer: Sure, it's plugged in right here. (pause, sound of unplugging) Okay, unplugged.

Agent: Leave that unplugged for about thirty seconds as well.

Customer: (pause) Thirty seconds is up... plugging it back in. (pause) Alright, it's back on.

Agent: Now, let's watch those lights. What are you seeing now?

Customer: (pause) It's booting up, I think. Okay, so the green light came back on... and... (pause) the red light is back too.

Agent: (pause) The red light is back immediately?

Customer: Yeah, it's right back. Why? What does that mean?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) That... that actually indicates a signal issue from our network to your ONT. And that's something that's typically on our infrastructure side, not something we can fix with troubleshooting. (pause) Let me check if there have been any alerts or issues reported in your area.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) I'm not seeing any alerts right now, which is unusual. But with that red light on the ONT and the modem not connecting, it does seem like there's a problem with the signal coming to your house. (pause) I think at this point, we're going to need to send a technician out to your location to diagnose this properly. This is beyond what we can fix over the phone.

Customer: A technician? How long would that take? I really need my internet working. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I can get someone out to you as early as tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have a later slot on Thursday afternoon. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning is... I guess that's fine. What if they can't fix it?

Agent: The technician will be able to do a full diagnostic of the ONT, check the fiber line coming to your house, and look at the network signal strength. Ninety percent of the time, issues like this are resolved on the first visit. But in the rare case that it's something more complex, they'll be able to determine what needs to happen next.

Customer: Alright, tomorrow morning then. Is there anything I should do in the meantime?

Agent: Just leave everything powered on as is. Don't do any more resets. The technician will want to see exactly what state it's in when they arrive. Can I get a phone number where we can reach you tomorrow?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as my account.

Agent: Perfect. So to confirm, we have a technician scheduled for tomorrow, [inaudible] between 8 AM and 12 PM at your residence. You should receive a confirmation email and text message within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, at least.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it fixed today, but the technician should have you up and running tomorrow. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
