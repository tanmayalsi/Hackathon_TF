# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work stuff I need to do from home.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. And my last name is Chen, C-H-E-N.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, Mr. Chen. I'm pulling up your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. And you mentioned the internet has been down since this morning?

Customer: Yeah, since around 7 AM. I tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in, but nothing happened.

Agent: Okay, that's a good first step. Let me ask you a few questions. Is your modem powered on right now? Do you see any lights on the front of it?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, um... let me look at it. It's over there on the shelf. I can see... there's a light that's red. Is that bad?

Agent: A red light typically indicates there's an issue with the connection. That's helpful to know. Can you tell me what color the other lights are?

Customer: Uh... (pause) there's one that's blinking orange, and I think... yeah, one's green I think. But most of them are off.

Agent: Alright. The green light is usually good, but the red and orange are telling us the modem isn't connecting to the network properly. Let me have you try something. Can you locate the power cable on the modem and unplug it for me?

Customer: Okay, one second... (pause) Yeah, I see it. Unplugging now.

Agent: Great. Now can you wait for about thirty seconds? Just leave it unplugged.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) ...still waiting...

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. Now what? Do I wait for something to happen?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Let's wait for about two minutes for it to fully restart. While we're waiting, let me ask—have there been any storms in your area recently? Or any work being done outside your home?

Customer: (pause) Um, no storms that I know of. There was some... actually, yeah, now that you mention it, there was a utility truck in the neighborhood yesterday. I think they were working on something down the street.

Agent: Ah, okay. That could potentially be related. Did you notice the internet going out yesterday at all?

Customer: No, it was working fine yesterday. It was only this morning.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright. So the modem should be fully booted up by now. Can you check those lights again for me?

Customer: (pause) Um... okay, so now I see... still red. And the orange one is still blinking. The green light... I don't see the green one anymore.

Agent: Hm, that's not ideal. The fact that the green light disappeared is a concern. Let me check our system here to see if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) No, I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end in your zip code.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it my modem?

Agent: It could be a few things. Let me have you try another troubleshooting step. Can you check if the cable going from the wall to your modem is securely plugged in on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me look... The cable is plugged into the wall, and it's... (pause) wait. One second. I'm checking the modem end. It looks like... actually, I think it might be a little loose. Let me push it in. (slight grunt)

Agent: Okay, go ahead. Let me know once you've got it secure.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's definitely in there now. I can feel it's snug.

Agent: Good. Now let's give it another moment and check those lights again.

Customer: (pause) Okay... so I'm looking at it now and... (sigh) the lights are still the same. Red, orange blinking, and... no green.

Agent: Still the same, huh? (pause) Alright, let me try one more thing. Let's do a full factory reset on the modem. I know this is a bit more involved, but it might help. Do you see a small button on the back of the modem? It might be recessed.

Customer: On the back? (pause) Um, yeah. I see a button. It's really small and kind of in like... a little hole?

Agent: That's the one. We're going to hold that down for about ten to fifteen seconds. Are you ready?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I got it. Holding it down... (pause) ...still holding... (pause) Okay, how long now?

Agent: Another five seconds or so...

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm letting go.

Agent: Perfect. Now the modem is going to restart again. This should take a couple of minutes. While that happens, let me look at something on the account. (typing sounds)

Customer: So, um, what happens if the reset doesn't work?

Agent: Well, that's a good question. If this doesn't resolve it, we may be looking at either a hardware issue with the modem itself, or possibly a problem with the line coming into your home. But let's see what happens with this reset first.

Customer: (pause) Okay...

Agent: How's it looking now? Any changes in the lights?

Customer: (pause) Um... not yet. I see the modem is doing something—there's some lights flickering. Let me give it another... okay, now it's... (pause) no, still red. Still orange blinking. I don't think the green light is coming back.

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, that's not great. The fact that we're not seeing that connection light come on is telling me this might be a hardware issue. Have you tried using your phone's hotspot as a backup, or do you have any other internet access right now?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I have hotspot on my phone. That's working. But I need the home internet because I have video calls and stuff for work, and the hotspot won't be reliable enough.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see here... (typing sounds) Okay, Mr. Chen, at this point I think we've exhausted the standard troubleshooting steps. I have a few options for you. We could send a technician out to your home to check the line and potentially replace the modem if it's faulty. That would typically be within the next 24 to 48 hours.

Customer: How much would that cost?

Agent: If it's determined to be a network issue on our end, there'd be no charge for the service call. If it's the modem itself and it's out of warranty, there would be a charge, but we can discuss that with the technician. When would be a good time for them to come out?

Customer: I mean... I really need this working today if possible. Is there any way to get someone sooner?

Agent: (pause) Let me check availability... (typing sounds) Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day appointments available in your area. The earliest we have is tomorrow between 2 and 6 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sigh) I guess that'll have to do. Tomorrow afternoon.

Agent: Alright, let me get that scheduled for you. Can I confirm your address?

Customer: Yeah, it's 447 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. So we have you down for tomorrow, [inaudible] between 2 and 6 PM. A technician will come out and assess the issue. They'll check the outside line and your modem. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. I just hope they can get it fixed quickly.

Agent: I understand your frustration. We'll do our best to get you back online as soon as possible. Thanks for choosing Frontier, Mr. Chen. Have a good day.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
