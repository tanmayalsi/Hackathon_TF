Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging stuff but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned the internet's been down since this morning. Have there been any storms in your area, or any recent weather events?

Customer: No, it's been clear all day. That's what's frustrating, you know? There's no reason for it to just... stop working.

Agent: I completely understand. Let's get this fixed for you. First, I'm going to walk you through some basic troubleshooting steps. Can you locate your modem and router right now?

Customer: Yeah, they're both right here on the shelf by my TV.

Agent: Great. So what I need you to do is unplug the modem first—that's usually the box with all the lights on it. Go ahead and wait about 30 seconds, then plug it back in.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...unplugging now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. I'm waiting.

Agent: (pause) Perfect. While that's resetting, let me just ask—when you say the internet's not working, are you getting any lights on the modem at all, or is it completely dark?

Customer: There are lights, yeah. The power light is on but it's... it seems like the internet light isn't coming on like it normally does. It's been blinking red, I think.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. A red light typically indicates a connection issue. Go ahead and plug that modem back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Just plugged it in now. (pause) Okay, the lights are coming back on. The power light's on, and... hmm, the internet light is still red. It's still blinking red.

Agent: Alright, let me check on our end. (typing sounds) Let me see what's going on with your account. One moment please.

(brief hold music)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So I'm showing that we do have your modem registered in our system, but I'm not seeing an active connection from your modem at this time. Let me ask you this—do you have any splitters or anything between the wall outlet and your modem?

Customer: Uh... I don't think so. I mean, I'm pretty sure it's just plugged straight into the wall. Well, not the wall—into the outlet box thing behind my entertainment center.

Agent: Right, so that's fine. What I need you to do now is check the cable that's running from the wall into your modem. It's the coaxial cable—it's the one that looks kind of like an antenna cable. Can you make sure it's screwed in nice and tight?

Customer: (pause) Okay, looking now... it seems pretty tight already, but let me... (pause) ...trying to tighten it more. Is this... how much tighter should I...?

Agent: Just turn it clockwise until you feel resistance. Don't force it.

Customer: Okay, got it. (pause) That's probably as tight as it's going to go.

Agent: Good. Now, let's also check the cable coming into the wall. Is that connection visible or is it behind your entertainment center?

Customer: It's behind there. I'd have to... I mean, I could pull things out but it might take a minute.

Agent: If it's not too much trouble, that would be really helpful. Sometimes those can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, hold on. (pause) I'm moving some stuff. There's a lot of... okay, I found it. (pause) It looks like it's... pretty secure, I think. I mean, I'm not an expert or anything.

Agent: No, you're doing great. Can you see if the cable looks damaged at all? Like, any kinks or anything bent on it?

Customer: (pause) Um... not that I can see. It looks normal to me.

Agent: Alright. And now, let me ask you—when this happened, had you restarted your modem yet before you called us?

Customer: Just the once that I did before you told me to.

Agent: Okay, let's try a factory reset. This is going to temporarily disconnect you from the internet, but it should help. On the back of your modem, there should be a small hole. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's a little recessed button, right?

Agent: Exactly. I need you to take a pen or something small and press and hold that button for about 10 to 15 seconds. This is going to reset the modem completely.

Customer: (pause) Okay, doing that now. (pause) I'm holding it... (pause) ...still holding... (pause) Okay, I let go. The lights are all going dark.

Agent: Perfect. That's what we want to see. Now just wait about two minutes. The modem's going to go through its restart sequence and the lights should start coming back on.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm waiting. (pause) Okay, so the lights are coming back on now. There's the power light... and the internet light is... (pause) ...still red. It's still red.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) Let me run a line test to see if we're getting a signal from our equipment.

(brief hold)

Agent: Alright, so I'm running the test now. Can you just give me one more second... (pause) Okay. I'm seeing that we're sending a signal, but we're not getting a response back from your modem. This could indicate that there's an issue with the device itself, or it could be a connection issue at the line level.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: It's possible, but not necessarily. Before we go down that road, let me try one more thing. Do you have access to your router as well? The separate device that's probably a different shape?

Customer: Yeah, it's right next to the modem. The black rectangular thing?

Agent: That's probably it. I need you to unplug that as well and wait about a minute. The router sometimes can cause connection issues if it's not communicating properly with the modem.

Customer: (pause) Unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, waiting.

Agent: (pause) While we wait, just to be thorough, how long have you had this modem and router?

Customer: Uh... I think you guys gave me these when I set up service... maybe two years ago?

Agent: Alright, so they're relatively new. (pause) Go ahead and plug that router back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in. (pause) Okay. (pause) Lights are coming on... and... no, the modem still has the red light.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Yeah, I'm going to be honest with you—at this point, with all the troubleshooting steps we've gone through, I think we need to get a technician out to your location. This could be a problem with the line outside, or the modem might need to be replaced. But I can't diagnose that over the phone.

Customer: So you're saying you can't fix it right now?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. But what I can do is schedule a technician to come out to your home. They'll be able to check the connection from the street, replace the modem if needed, and get you back online. How does that sound?

Customer: I guess that's... when could they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability. I've got an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could do Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning, I guess. I really need to get back online.

Agent: Perfect. So I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, 8 AM to noon. A technician will come to your address on Maple Street. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No... I mean, I just hope they can actually fix it. This is pretty frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. The technician will definitely get to the bottom of this. If you have any questions before tomorrow, feel free to give us a call back. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Have a good day.
