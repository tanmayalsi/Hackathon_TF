Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I work from home and I'm kind of losing my mind here.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. So internet's completely out, is that right? Not just slow?

Customer: Yeah, completely out. I tried unplugging the modem and router this morning, waited like five minutes, plugged it back in... nothing. The lights on the modem aren't even coming on.

Agent: Okay, so the modem has no lights at all. That's helpful information. Let's start with the basics. Can you check if the power cable is firmly connected to the modem and to the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me... (background noise, sounds of movement) Yeah, it's plugged in. I'm looking at it right now and it's definitely plugged in.

Agent: Good. And what about the outlet itself? Do you have anything else plugged into that outlet that you know is working?

Customer: Um, actually no. It's kind of in the corner. But like... I could try a different outlet if you want?

Agent: That's actually a great idea. Go ahead and do that. Unplug the power cable from the modem and plug it into a different outlet, maybe somewhere more central in your house if you can.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, moving it now... (pause) Alright, it's in the outlet next to my desk now.

Agent: Perfect. Give it about 30 seconds to boot up and see if you get any lights on the modem.

Customer: (pause) Come on, come on... (longer pause) No. Still nothing. This is... this is really not good.

Agent: I understand. Let's try one more thing. Can you locate the power adapter itself? Sometimes the issue is with the adapter rather than the outlet. Do you see any damage to it or any unusual smell?

Customer: (pause) No, looks fine to me. It's a black box, pretty standard looking. No burns or anything.

Agent: Okay. Well, the fact that we're getting no power at all suggests it might be the adapter or possibly a power issue. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) Are you able to see if there's a reset button on the modem? Usually it's a small pinhole button on the back.

Customer: There's a button back here... looks like it, yeah.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and hold that down for about 10 seconds while the modem is powered off.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Nothing's happening though.

Agent: Right, that's expected since there's no power. But once we get power, that reset might help. Let me look at something here. (pause) Okay, so I'm going to be honest with you—when a modem has zero lights and zero response, it's usually a hardware issue rather than a service issue. That could be the power adapter or the modem itself.

Customer: So... what does that mean? How long is this going to take to fix?

Agent: Well, that's the tricky part. I can definitely order a replacement modem for you, but I have to be upfront—we're looking at about 3 to 5 business days for shipping, depending on your area. 

Customer: Are you kidding me? Three to five days? I work from home. I have meetings tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand how urgent this is. Um... (pause) let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) Unfortunately, we don't have any expedited shipping options available right now, and our local service appointments... actually, let me check if there's any availability for a technician visit. (pause) The earliest I'm seeing is Thursday afternoon. Would that work for you?

Customer: How much would that cost?

Agent: Because this appears to be a hardware failure, there shouldn't be a service charge for the technician visit. You'd just need to be home between 2 and 6 PM on Thursday.

Customer: Alright, I... can you do anything sooner? Today? Tomorrow morning?

Agent: (pause) Let me check... (typing sounds, longer pause) No, I'm not seeing anything available before Thursday. Our technicians are pretty booked up. But with the replacement modem, you might actually receive it before Thursday anyway, so it could be a race—

Customer: Or neither of those happen and I'm without internet for days. (frustrated pause)

Agent: I hear your frustration. Let me be totally transparent with you. I've tried all the basic troubleshooting steps with you, and the modem appears to be a hardware failure. Beyond sending a replacement or having a technician look at it, there's not much else I can troubleshoot from my end. 

Customer: I know, I know. I'm sorry for being frustrated. I just... (sighs) I really need this working.

Agent: Totally fair. So what I can do is get a replacement modem sent to you via overnight shipping, which would get it to you by tomorrow evening. It would be... let me see the cost here... it looks like that would be an additional $19.99 charge because expedited shipping isn't standard on our service replacements.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah. Do that. Let's do overnight shipping.

Agent: Perfect. Actually, I'm looking at this closer and I'm seeing that with your account and service history, I can waive that fee for you. So the replacement will be completely free overnight.

Customer: Really? That's... thank you. That actually helps a lot.

Agent: Of course. So what I'm going to do is get that shipped out today. You should receive it tomorrow between 8 AM and 8 PM. When it arrives, you'll just need to unbox it, connect the power and ethernet, and it should automatically activate on your line.

Customer: Okay, and... I just follow the setup instructions or—

Agent: Exactly. It's pretty straightforward. If you do encounter any issues once it arrives, don't hesitate to give us a call back and we can walk through it. You can also reference this ticket number... (typing sounds) it's FC-774829.

Customer: FC-774829, got it.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I really appreciate your help, Derek, and for waiving that fee.

Agent: You're very welcome. I'm sorry you're dealing with this, but I'm confident we'll get you back online tomorrow. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and have a great rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.

Agent: Take care!
