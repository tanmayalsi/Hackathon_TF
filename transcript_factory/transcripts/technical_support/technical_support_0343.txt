Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out completely. I've been without it for like an hour now and I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you taken care of. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get a name on the account?

Customer: David. David Martinez.

Agent: Great, David. I'm showing your account here. So you're currently without any internet service at all, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, complete outage. Nothing. My router's lit up like a Christmas tree with lights, but nothing's actually working.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Before we dive in, let me just ask—have you noticed any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, this is the first time. Everything's been working fine up until about an hour ago.

Agent: Alright. So what I'd like to do is walk you through a few troubleshooting steps. First things first—can you tell me if the modem itself is powered on? There should be a light on the front of it.

Customer: Yeah, like I said, it's lit up. There's definitely power going to it.

Agent: Perfect. And when you say it's lit up, are you seeing the typical lights—like power, internet connection, that kind of thing?

Customer: Um... (pause) yeah, I see a power light that's solid. Then there's like a red light blinking, which I'm guessing is bad?

Agent: The red light, okay. That typically indicates that there's no signal coming in. So the issue is likely with either the connection to your home or the device itself. Let me ask you this—have there been any recent storms or weather in your area?

Customer: Not that I know of, no. It's been clear all day.

Agent: Okay, good. What I'd like you to do for me is unplug the modem from the power source. Just give me the power cable and pull it out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, done. How long do I wait?

Agent: Good question. Go ahead and wait about thirty seconds, then plug it back in. That should give it time to fully reset.

Customer: (longer pause) Alright, I'm plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about two to three minutes to boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me—do you have a separate router, or is your modem and router all in one device?

Customer: It's a separate router. So I've got the modem, and then the router's connected to it.

Agent: Great, that's helpful. Is the router showing any lights as well?

Customer: Yeah, the router looks fine. All the normal lights are on there.

Agent: Okay, so the issue is definitely on the modem side. (pause) Alright, let's check in. Are you seeing any change in the modem lights yet?

Customer: Um... (pause) I'm still seeing that red light blinking. Nothing's changed.

Agent: The red light is still blinking. Okay. David, let me ask—is there any visible damage to the cables coming into your modem? Any fraying, any discoloration, anything like that?

Customer: Hold on, let me look. (pause) No, the cables look fine to me. They're both plugged in pretty tight.

Agent: Alright. What I'd like you to do is unplug both cables—the power cable and the coaxial cable, the one that comes from the wall. Pull them both out, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug them back in. Start with the coaxial cable first, then the power.

Customer: Okay, doing it now. (pause, sound of things unplugging) Thirty seconds, right?

Agent: Yeah, thirty seconds should do it.

Customer: (longer pause) Alright, plugging the coaxial back in... and now the power. Okay, it's booting back up.

Agent: Good. Now we'll give it a few minutes again. I'm going to check a few things on my end while we wait. (typing sounds) Let me just verify your service is active... (pause) Yes, your service is showing as active on our end, so that's not the issue. Can you tell me when you last restarted your modem before today?

Customer: I don't know, maybe a week ago? Or longer? I don't really restart it unless something's wrong.

Agent: That's pretty normal. Okay, checking in again—any change in those lights?

Customer: Nope. Still the same red blinking light. This is ridiculous.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me try one more thing. Can you check if the coaxial cable—that's the one screwed onto the back of the modem—is fully tightened? Sometimes they can loosen up.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm checking it now. It seems pretty snug, but... (sound of twisting) let me tighten it just to be sure. There we go.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, let's wait just a moment and see if that helps. (pause) Any change?

Customer: [inaudible] ...no, still the same.

Agent: Okay, David, I've got to be honest with you—that red light indicating no signal is typically a problem on our end with the line coming to your home, or it could be an issue with the modem itself. At this point, I think we need to escalate this. I have a couple of options for you. We can schedule a technician to come out and check the line and your equipment. That would typically be within the next couple of days.

Customer: A couple of days? Is there anything else we can try right now?

Agent: Unfortunately, at this point, I've walked through our standard troubleshooting steps and the modem isn't connecting to our network. Without being able to see what's happening on the line side, a technician is really the next step. They'll be able to test the signal coming into your home and swap out the modem if needed.

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, okay. I mean, I work from home, so this is kind of a big deal. Can you get someone out here tomorrow?

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds, hold music briefly) I'm seeing we have availability tomorrow, actually. We have a morning window between eight and twelve, or an afternoon window between one and five. Which would work better for you?

Customer: The afternoon window. One to five.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just confirm all your information here... (pause, typing) Okay, so we have a technician scheduled for tomorrow, one to five PM. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. The technician will bring a replacement modem if needed, and they'll check everything on our end as well.

Customer: Alright, I guess that's the best we can do.

Agent: I apologize we couldn't get this resolved today, David, but our technician will definitely get you back up and running. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow. Have a good day.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
