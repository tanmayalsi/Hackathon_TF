Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried unplugging everything, but it's still not working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account here... Got it. I see you're in the Riverside area on our fiber service. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Is your modem powered on right now?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. The lights are on and everything, but like... I don't know, something seems off about them maybe?

Agent: Okay, what do you mean by off? Can you describe what you're seeing on the modem?

Customer: Um, well, normally I see like a blue light and a green light, I think? But right now I only see the blue one. The green one isn't lit up.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. That green light usually indicates your internet connection. So we're definitely looking at a connectivity issue here. Let me have you try something for me. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in?

Customer: Sure, yeah. (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, I'm counting... thirty seconds... (pause) And... plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and give that about a minute or so to fully reboot. While that's happening, let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me if you've had any recent weather or storms in your area?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear actually. Sunny all day.

Agent: Okay, and you haven't had any recent work done on your line or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that.

Agent: Alright. Do you see that green light coming back up yet?

Customer: (pause) No, not yet. Still just the blue light. Does it usually take longer?

Agent: It shouldn't take much longer than this. Let me try something else. Can you check the back of your modem and make sure all the cables are plugged in securely? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, I'm looking back there. Um... (pause) There's the power cable, that looks good. There's a cable coming in from the wall... that looks like it's in there pretty tight too.

Agent: Perfect. And then there should be an ethernet cable if you're hardwired, or if you're using WiFi just disregard that.

Customer: No, there's... yeah, there's a cable hooked up to my computer too.

Agent: Okay, why don't you try unplugging that ethernet cable from the modem itself, wait five seconds, and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Doing that now... okay, it's back in.

Agent: (pause) Is that green light showing up now?

Customer: No... still nothing. Just the blue light.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me put you on a very brief hold while I check if there's any service alerts in your area. It'll just be a moment.

Customer: Sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Thank you for holding. So I'm not seeing any alerts on the infrastructure side in your neighborhood, which is good news and bad news. It means this is likely isolated to your equipment. Let me try one more thing. Can you try doing a factory reset on the modem? There should be a small reset button on the back—it might be recessed.

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's like a tiny little button.

Agent: That's the one. You'll need something small like a paperclip to press it. Go ahead and hold that for about ten seconds while the modem is plugged in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I've got a paperclip... pushing the button... (pause) Okay, holding it... ten seconds... (pause) And releasing. Now what?

Agent: Now let's just give it another minute to fully reset and reboot.

Customer: Okay. (long pause) Still nothing. The green light is still not coming on.

Agent: [inaudible] ...alright, so we've tried the standard troubleshooting steps. At this point, it's looking like we might have a hardware issue with your modem, or possibly something with the line coming into your house. I wish I had better news, but I think we're going to need to get a technician out to your location.

Customer: Oh man, really? How long would that take?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) I can get someone out there tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or... we have a later slot on Thursday between 1 and 5 PM if that works better for you.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. Can they definitely fix it?

Agent: Well, the technician will be able to diagnose what's happening on the line side and we can replace the modem if needed. I can't guarantee anything until they take a look, but we'll definitely get to the root of the issue.

Customer: Okay, I guess that's... that's fine. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home to let them in, and if you want to have your account information handy, that's helpful but not necessary. They'll have all your info.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thank you, I guess. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved over the phone today. But our tech team is really good at getting to the bottom of these things. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's... that's all I guess.

Agent: Alright, well, thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll get you back online real soon. Have a good night.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
