Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet just completely went down like an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've got a work call in like twenty minutes and I'm kind of freaking out here.

Agent: Oh, I understand—that's definitely frustrating. Let me help you get that sorted out. First, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. Or actually, you know what, I can give you both. It's 555-0147 and the phone number is 555-8432.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Alright, I'm pulling up your account now. Can you also tell me your name?

Customer: It's David. David Chen.

Agent: Great, David. Okay, I see your account here. I'm showing you're on our 500 megabit fiber plan at that address. And I do see that you're offline right now. Let me just ask you a few quick questions. Do you have your modem and router in front of you?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, they're right here. Um, both of them are sitting under my TV.

Agent: Good. Okay, so can you describe what you're seeing on them right now? Are there any lights lit up?

Customer: (pause) So on the modem, I'm seeing... there's a red light on it. I think it's on the power button or something. And the router, um, it looks like it might have lost power? I don't see any lights on it at all.

Agent: Alright, okay. So the red light on the modem typically means there's no internet signal coming in. Let me walk you through a few things here. First, can you make sure both devices are plugged in securely? Like, actually unplug them and check the cables?

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) ...okay, let me... yeah, so the modem is plugged in to the outlet, and the... wait, actually, hold on. Let me check the back of the router. (rustling sounds) Oh! Oh, it's not plugged in. I must've... my kid probably knocked it loose or something.

Agent: (chuckles) Hey, happens all the time. Go ahead and plug that back in for me.

Customer: Okay, plugging it in now. (pause) Alright, it's back in. I see the lights coming on. Should be... yeah, the lights are starting to come back on.

Agent: Perfect. So give it about thirty seconds to fully boot up. Once you see the lights stabilize—usually you'll see a solid blue or green light on the modem—that means it's got a connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. Um... so the modem... I'm still seeing that red light. And the router seems to be lighting up normally now, but the modem... the modem's still red.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me check a couple things on my end here. (typing sounds) Actually, I am seeing some signal issues on your line. Let me try a reset on the modem from my system here. That should take about thirty seconds to a minute.

Customer: Okay, you're doing that now?

Agent: Yep, sending the reset right now. Give it about a minute to reboot.

Customer: (pause) Alright... (longer pause) ...still waiting. And, um... (pause) ...no, it's still showing that red light. It's been like... probably a minute and a half now.

Agent: Okay, so the red light persisting is... hmm. Let me ask you—when you look at your modem, is there any indication of what that red light means? Does it say anything near it, or...?

Customer: (pause) I'm looking at it pretty closely. I don't see any labels or anything. It just says "Frontier" on the front. There's a power button, I think, and then just... the red light. And there's like maybe four other lights but they're all off.

Agent: Okay, got it. So the other lights being off is actually a bit concerning. What I'd like to try next is a manual restart. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (unplugging sounds) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) I'm counting... thirty seconds... (pause) alright, should be good. Plugging it back in now. (plugging sound) (pause) Okay, the lights are coming on again.

Agent: Great. Just let that boot up again.

Customer: Yeah, I'm watching it. (long pause) So, um... okay, the same thing is happening. I'm getting the red light on the power button and everything else is off.

Agent: Alright. David, I want to make sure I'm not missing anything here. Can you trace the cable that goes from the modem to the wall? Like, the incoming signal line? Is that plugged in securely?

Customer: The... cable from the wall? (pause) Oh, okay, I see what you mean. Let me... (rustling) Yeah, it's... it looks like it's plugged in, but let me... (more rustling) ...okay, I'm unplugging it and... (pause) ...replugging it. Yeah, I mean, it feels pretty secure.

Agent: Okay. And that cable—the one from the wall—did it look like it was in good condition? Any damage or anything?

Customer: No, looks fine to me. I mean, I'm no expert, but... (pause) ...it just looks like a regular cable.

Agent: (typing sounds) You know what, I'm going to be honest with you here. Based on what I'm seeing on my end and what we're trying on your end, I think there might be something going on with the modem itself or the line coming to your house. The fact that it's showing that red light after the reset suggests it's not establishing a connection to our network.

Customer: So, like... what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: (pause) Well, here's what I want to do. I'd like to get a technician out to your location to do a physical inspection. They can check the line coming in, make sure everything's connected properly on the outside, and if needed, they can swap out the modem for a new one.

Customer: How long would that take? Like, when could someone come out? Because I really need this working today if possible.

Agent: Let me check our schedule here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so... it looks like our next available window is... actually, we have someone who can come out today. We've got an opening between 2 PM and 4 PM.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's... that's actually not too bad. That should work.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to get that scheduled for you. Can I confirm the address that I have on file? It's 342 Maple Street, Apartment 4B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And the best number to reach you at if the technician needs to contact you?

Customer: Um, you can use the phone number I gave you earlier—555-8432—or I can text them, but the phone number is probably easiest.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap everything: you're all set for a technician visit today between 2 and 4 PM. They'll be coming out to do a full diagnostic on the line and the modem. The confirmation number for this appointment is 7-4-2-9-5-8. You should get a text confirmation shortly.

Customer: Okay, great. So just to be clear—you couldn't get it working from your end?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, no. We've tried the remote reset and the manual reset, and the modem isn't establishing a connection to our network. So it does look like it's going to need an on-site visit to diagnose further.

Customer: Alright, well, I guess that's what I need to do then. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: Of course, David. And I'm sorry you're dealing with this, especially with that work call coming up. But hopefully the technician can get you back online quickly today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you this afternoon.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
