# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried a few things but nothing's working. I'm getting pretty frustrated at this point.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that can be. I'm gonna do my best to get you back online today. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Got it. So I'm showing your account is for 500 megabit fiber service at 1247 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And what exactly are you experiencing right now? Is the modem completely down, or are you seeing any lights on it?

Customer: Okay, so the modem is on. I can see some lights, but they're... I think they're red? Or maybe orange? I'm not really sure. But my computer's not connecting to it. Like, I can see the WiFi network pop up, but when I try to connect, it just says "can't connect to this network."

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what kind of modem you have? It should say Frontier on it somewhere.

Customer: Um, yeah, it's a white box. There's a router built in, I think? It says... it looks like it says, uh... (pause) "Frontier G1100." I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so I'm showing that model in your account. Now, I want you to locate the power cable on the back of that modem. Do you see it?

Customer: Yeah, I can see it. What do you want me to do?

Agent: I want you to unplug it. Just pull it straight out.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Done. Should I wait a minute?

Agent: Yeah, actually, let's wait about 30 seconds. That'll help reset the system.

Customer: (pause) ...Alright, 30 seconds is up.

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. Now what?

Agent: Now we're gonna give it about two minutes to fully boot back up. While we're waiting, can you tell me... when did this stop working exactly? This morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, this morning around 7 or 8. I was working from home and everything was fine, and then I noticed I couldn't load any pages. At first I thought it was just a slow day, but then nothing would load at all.

Agent: And have you had any power outages in your area or any storms last night that you know of?

Customer: No, I mean... there was some rain, but nothing crazy. And the power's been fine.

Agent: Alright, that's good. Okay, so have you noticed any change in those lights on the modem now that it's been plugged back in?

Customer: Um... (pause) okay so now I see... it looks like one light is blinking green, but there's still an orange light. Is that normal?

Agent: (pause) Which lights are blinking? Can you describe their position for me? Like, are they on the left side of the modem or the right?

Customer: They're kind of in the middle. There's one, two, three... there are like, five lights in a row. The second one from the left is green and blinking. The fifth one is orange and I don't think it's blinking.

Agent: Okay, so the orange light on the far right is solid orange?

Customer: Yeah, solid orange.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. That's... that's actually indicating a connection issue. Let me just check your line here. (typing sounds) Give me one second... Okay, I'm not seeing any issues on our end with your line. The service is showing as active. Let me try one more thing here. Can you tell me if there are any cables connected to the back of that modem?

Customer: Yeah, there's a cable going into it. Looks like a, uh... a coax cable?

Agent: Right, that's the one. Can you check and make sure it's screwed in tightly?

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me look... Yeah, it seems pretty tight. Let me try to wiggle it a bit. (pause) No, it's definitely screwed in.

Agent: Alright. And there's nothing unplugged or anything like that?

Customer: No, everything looks connected.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so... let me try resetting the modem from our end. This might take a few minutes. I'm going to do a factory reset on the device, and you should see it restart.

Customer: Okay, how long should that take?

Agent: Should be just a few minutes. Let me do that now. (typing sounds) Alright, I've initiated the reset. You should see the lights start cycling through different colors right now.

Customer: Oh, wow, okay yeah. They're all... they're kind of going crazy. Different colors flashing.

Agent: That's normal. That's the modem rebooting. Let's give that about three minutes to complete.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm watching it...

Agent: So while we wait, have you tried connecting on your phone or a different device at all?

Customer: No, I haven't. Just my laptop. But the phone does show the WiFi network, so the router part is at least transmitting.

Agent: Right, that's actually good information. That means the WiFi is working, which narrows things down. 

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the lights are slowing down now. I think it's almost done.

Agent: Good. It should settle into a normal pattern in just a moment. Alright, what are you seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Um, okay so now I've got... it looks like solid green lights and one solid orange light again. Same as before, I think.

Agent: (pause) Okay. So that orange light is still there. That's... that's not ideal. Can you try connecting on your phone right now and see if it works?

Customer: (pause) Sure, let me try. (pause) Okay, I'm selecting the network... putting in the password... (longer pause) It's loading... but it's not connecting. It says "can't verify password," but I know my password is right.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, that's interesting. Can you tell me the SSID? That's the name of the network showing on your phone?

Customer: It says "FRONTIER-4782" or something like that.

Agent: Okay, so that's the factory default network name. That's correct. But the fact that it's rejecting the password is... that's unusual. Have you ever changed your WiFi password?

Customer: No, I've never messed with any of that stuff. I just... I use the default password that came with it.

Agent: Right. Okay, so... this is a bit unusual. Um... (pause) I want to try one more thing. Can you locate the reset button on the back of the modem? It's usually a small button that you'd need a paperclip to press.

Customer: Okay, let me check the back. (pause) Yeah, I see a tiny hole right here. Is that it?

Agent: That's probably it, yeah. But before we do a full reset, I want to be upfront with you—if we do a complete reset, you'll lose all your WiFi settings and I'll have to guide you through setting it all up again from scratch. Are you okay with that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean, if it'll get my internet working, then yeah, let's do it.

Agent: Alright. So what I need you to do is get a paperclip or a pushpin—something small and thin—and hold that reset button down for about 10 seconds. It'll turn off completely. Okay?

Customer: Got it. (pause) Okay, I've got a paperclip. Pushing the button now. (pause) Everything's turning off.

Agent: Alright. Give it about 30 seconds to fully power down this time.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, 30 seconds is up. Should I turn it back on?

Agent: There should be a power button on the front. Go ahead and press that.

Customer: (pause) Pressing it now. (pause) Okay, it's powering back on. The lights are cycling again.

Agent: Great. Now this time, while it's booting up, I want to have you ready to set up the WiFi fresh. While we wait, do you have any devices nearby that you can use to connect? Like a tablet or another computer?

Customer: I have my phone. Is that good enough?

Agent: Yeah, your phone is perfect. Alright, so let's wait for this to finish booting. (pause) How are those lights looking?

Customer: (pause) Okay, they're settling down now. I'm seeing... green lights again. And... yeah, that orange light is back.

Agent: (sighs) That orange light... (pause) Okay. I want to be honest with you for a moment. That orange light typically indicates an issue with the optical connection. It usually means either there's a problem with the line itself, or there might be an issue with the modem's optical receiver.

Customer: Oh. So like... what does that mean? Is something broken?

Agent: It could be one of a few things. It could mean there's a problem with the fiber line itself, or it could mean there's an issue with the modem. Unfortunately, with that light staying solid orange, the modem isn't able to establish a proper connection to our network.

Customer: (pause) So what do I do?

Agent: Well, I've tried the basic troubleshooting steps here. Honestly, I think at this point we need to get a technician out to your location. They can check the fiber line and potentially replace the modem if that's the issue.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back. I'm working from home and my boss is gonna kill me if I can't get online soon.

Agent: I totally understand. Let me see what appointments we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) So we have availability tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or... we do have a slot opening up the day after tomorrow in the morning, between 8 and 12.

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... (pause) I guess tomorrow afternoon would work. Can you make sure they bring a new modem or whatever? I want to make sure this gets fixed.

Agent: Absolutely. I'll make a note on your account that there's a persistent orange light on the optical connection and that a modem replacement may be needed. The technician will assess everything when they arrive.

Customer: Okay. Thanks, I guess. So 1 to 5 tomorrow?

Agent: Yes, tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. You'll get a confirmation text to the number on file. Is that still 555-0089?

Customer: (pause) Actually, that might be old. Can you use 555-0156?

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'll update that. You'll get a text confirmation, and the technician will come by to troubleshoot the issue. Again, I apologize that we couldn't get it working over the phone today, but I'm confident the technician will be able to resolve this for you tomorrow.

Customer: Alright. Thank you, I guess. This is frustrating, but I appreciate the help.

Agent: I'm really sorry you've had this experience. We'll get you back online as quickly as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
