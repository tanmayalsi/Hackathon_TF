Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that now. And your name is...?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. When exactly did you first notice it stopped working?

Customer: I'd say around 8:30 or so. I was trying to log into a meeting and nothing was loading. I waited like twenty minutes thinking maybe it was just slow, but then I realized the WiFi icon on my phone wasn't even showing my network anymore.

Agent: Alright, so the WiFi isn't showing up at all. Have you checked if the modem and router are powered on? Sometimes they can lose power or reset themselves.

Customer: Yeah, I did that already. Both lights are on. The modem's got the blue light, and the router's showing green, so I don't think that's it.

Agent: Good, that's helpful. Okay, so let me walk you through a few quick things. Can you see if there's a red light or anything blinking on the modem that looks unusual?

Customer: (pause) Um, there's one red light on the bottom right. Is that bad?

Agent: That actually indicates an issue with the connection coming into your modem. So the problem is likely on our end or with the line itself. Have you noticed any loose cables in the back of the modem?

Customer: Let me look... (rustling sounds) No, everything looks pretty secure back there. I'm not really... I mean, I'm not super technical, so...

Agent: No worries at all. Let's try a power cycle. Can you unplug the modem for about thirty seconds? Just pull it out completely.

Customer: Sure. (pause) Okay, unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just give it about thirty seconds... while that's happening, David, have there been any recent storms in your area or construction work going on?

Customer: Actually, yeah. There was some road work yesterday about two blocks away. Why, does that matter?

Agent: It could. Sometimes vibrations or accidental cable damage from construction can affect service. Let's see if the reboot helps. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) It's starting up... the lights are cycling through... okay, now they're both on again like before.

Agent: Alright. Let's wait another thirty seconds for everything to fully boot up. (pause) Do you see the red light again?

Customer: Yeah, it's still there on the bottom right. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check our systems here for any outages in your area. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any reported outages in your neighborhood currently, which is good news and bad news. It means the issue is likely specific to your line. How long have you been a customer with Frontier?

Customer: About... I think three years now? Maybe a little longer.

Agent: Okay, and have you experienced anything like this before?

Customer: No, nothing. It's been pretty reliable actually. That's why I'm kind of surprised.

Agent: I appreciate that. Let me try one more thing. Can you tell me what color the cable is that's plugged into the coax port on the back of the modem?

Customer: (pause) It's white. Is that... normal?

Agent: That's fine, that's normal. Do you see any visible damage to it at all? Any kinks or tears?

Customer: (pause) Not that I can see, no. Looks okay to me.

Agent: Alright. David, I'm going to be honest with you—that red light typically indicates a signal issue coming from the line outside your home, or potentially a problem at our network interface on your property. At this point, I think we need to send a technician out to diagnose this properly. [inaudible] Let me see what appointments we have available for you.

Customer: How long would that take? Like, when could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check... I'm showing we have some availability. We could get someone out to you tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we have an afternoon slot between 1 and 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be better. I have some morning meetings hopefully... well, if I can get to them somehow. (slight frustration in voice)

Agent: I totally understand. Let me get you booked for tomorrow afternoon. (typing sounds) Okay, so we have you down for tomorrow, between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will come out and check the line, the modem, and everything outside. Before they arrive, is there anything else I can help you troubleshoot? Just to make sure we've covered all the bases?

Customer: I don't think so. I tried everything you mentioned. Should I try restarting anything else?

Agent: You know what, let's try restarting the router as well. Sometimes that can help reset the connection. Just hold down the reset button on the back of the router for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Doing it now... (pause) Okay, it's restarting.

Agent: Give that a minute to come back online. (pause) ...Anything?

Customer: No, same thing. Modem still has that red light. The router came back up, but there's no internet connection.

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately it sounds like this is definitely a line-level issue that we need to investigate in person. I wish I could get you back online right now, I know how inconvenient this is. But our technician tomorrow should be able to identify and fix the problem. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully this gets resolved tomorrow, you know?

Agent: I completely understand, David. We'll make this a priority. I'm going to email you a confirmation of the appointment to the email on file. If you need to reschedule or have any questions before tomorrow, just call us back at the number on your bill. Is there anything else I can help with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, David, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get you back up and running. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a great day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
