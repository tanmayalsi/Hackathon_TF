Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, so my internet went out this morning and I've been without service for like three hours now. It's pretty frustrating because I'm working from home today.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online as quickly as we can. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up here... and I've got you as... Michael Chen, is that right?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage this morning. Have you noticed if your modem and router are showing any lights at all, or is everything dark?

Customer: Um, yeah, so the modem has like a red light on it. The router has some lights but... I don't know, they seem kind of dim? Or maybe they're not blinking the way they usually do.

Agent: Okay, that red light on the modem is actually telling us something. That typically means there's no connection coming in from our line. But let's go through some basic troubleshooting first. Have you tried unplugging the modem yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and do that. Unplug it from the power source, and then we'll wait about thirty seconds before we plug it back in. That's gonna allow it to fully reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) All right, it's unplugged. So I wait thirty seconds?

Agent: Yep, thirty seconds. That gives all the capacitors time to discharge.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in... (sounds of plugging in device) All right, it's back in. Now what?

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about two to three minutes to fully boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me—have there been any recent storms in your area? Any weather issues?

Customer: Uh, actually, yeah. We had some pretty heavy rain last night, and there was some wind. Nothing crazy, but it was definitely stormy.

Agent: Okay, that could potentially be a factor. Sometimes weather can affect the line. (pause) Let's just... why don't you check on that modem for me now? What color is the light showing?

Customer: Um... (pause) still red. Still the same red light.

Agent: Still red. Okay. And is it steady red, or is it blinking at all?

Customer: It's... I think it's blinking? Maybe? It's definitely red though.

Agent: (typing sounds) All right. Let me just check on our end if there are any outages reported in your area. Can you give me your zip code, Michael?

Customer: It's 94105.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, checking... No, I'm not seeing any active outages in that area currently. That's good news actually. Let me try something else. Is your modem a Frontier-provided unit, or did you purchase your own?

Customer: No, it's yours. The Frontier one. You guys provided it.

Agent: Okay, good. And the router—is that Frontier equipment as well?

Customer: No, that one's mine. I bought that separately.

Agent: All right, that's helpful to know. Let's try bypassing the router for a second. Can you take an ethernet cable and plug it directly from the modem into a computer or laptop? That'll help us figure out if the issue is with the router or with the modem itself.

Customer: Yeah, I can do that. Give me just a second... (pause) (sounds of movement) Okay, I found a cable. Plugging it in to my laptop now. Um... (pause) Nope, still nothing. The laptop's not showing any internet connection.

Agent: Hmm, okay. So we can rule out the router then. (pause) Michael, I'm gonna check the line on our end. This is gonna take me just a moment. Can you hold for about a minute?

Customer: Yeah, sure, go ahead.

Agent: (brief hold music plays, then stops) Okay, I'm back. So I'm looking at your line status, and the signal coming into your home is actually really weak. It's showing as... yeah, it's definitely not where it needs to be for a stable connection.

Customer: What does that mean? Is that something you guys can fix?

Agent: Well, it could be a few different things. It could be damage to the outside line from that weather you mentioned, or there could be a problem with the modem itself. Normally, what I'd recommend is that we send a technician out to your location to diagnose exactly what's going on.

Customer: Okay, um, when could someone come out? I really need my internet back today if possible. I have meetings this afternoon.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... (pause) The earliest I'm seeing is actually tomorrow morning between 8 AM and noon. Does that work for you?

Customer: (sighs) Tomorrow? That's... that's really not ideal. Is there anything else we can try right now?

Agent: Uh, let me think. Have you checked if there's any visible damage to the modem itself? Any cracks or anything that looks out of place?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... No, it looks fine. It looks totally normal to me.

Agent: Okay. And the cable that connects the modem to the wall outlet—can you make sure that's nice and snug? Sometimes those can come loose.

Customer: Yeah, I'm checking that now... (pause) It seems pretty tight to me.

Agent: All right. You know what, Michael? I've gone through the main troubleshooting steps, and based on that weak signal I'm seeing on the line, I think we do need to get a technician out there. It's likely something external that I can't diagnose over the phone.

Customer: (frustrated) So... what, I'm just stuck without internet until tomorrow?

Agent: I know that's frustrating, and I apologize. If there's any change or if your service miraculously comes back online, great. But it does sound like we need professional eyes on this. Let me get you scheduled with a technician. Did you want that tomorrow morning, the 8 AM to noon window?

Customer: I guess I don't have much choice, do I?

Agent: I really do apologize, Michael. I know this is frustrating. Let me make sure we get you in for that appointment. That would be tomorrow, [inaudible], between 8 AM and noon. The technician will have all your information, so they'll know exactly what's been going on. And is this phone number the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. You should get a confirmation text or email within the next few minutes. Do you have any other questions for me?

Customer: No, I guess not. Just... hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I really hope so too. And again, I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved today. Thank you for your patience, and thanks for being a Frontier customer.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Have a good one, Michael.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye.
