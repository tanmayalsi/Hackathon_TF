Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back on. I've tried everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Um, it's... (pause) 555-0847. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm pulling that up now. And what's your name?

Customer: It's David. David Morrison.

Agent: Great, David. Thanks for that. Alright, I've got your account here. I can see you're on our Fiber 100 plan in the Lakewood area. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Well, that's the thing. I don't see... I mean, the modem's not lit up at all. There's nothing. And I've tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, but nothing happens.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. When you plug it back in, you should see some lights come on within about 30 seconds or so. Is that not happening?

Customer: No, I wait like a full minute and there's just... nothing. It's completely dark.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, let me check on our end. Can you give me one second? (brief hold music) Okay, David, I'm looking at your connection here and it looks like we might have a service issue in your area, but let me ask you a few more questions first. When you plug in the modem, do you hear any sounds coming from it at all? Like a beep or humming noise?

Customer: No, nothing. I mean, I'm wondering if maybe the power cable is... (pause) but it should be fine, right?

Agent: That's actually a good thought. Can you double-check that the power cable is fully connected on both ends? The wall outlet and the modem itself?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, let me... okay, I'm checking now. The wall outlet end looks good. And the modem... (pause) wait, actually, let me see here. The cable in the back of the modem. Let me push it in a little more. Sometimes these things get loose.

Agent: Good idea.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm pushing it in. Do you want me to try plugging it in again?

Agent: Yes, definitely. Go ahead and unplug it from the wall for about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. Let me know what happens.

Customer: (sounds of unplugging) Alright, it's unplugged. I'm waiting... 30 seconds should be about... now. (plugging sounds) Okay, I'm plugging it back in now.

Agent: And...?

Customer: (pause) Ugh, still nothing. Still completely dark. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand, David. That's frustrating. Okay, let me try something else. Can you check your outlet itself? Maybe try plugging in something else, like a lamp or your phone charger, just to make sure the outlet has power?

Customer: Oh, that's... that's actually a good idea. Hold on. (pause) Let me grab my... okay, I'm plugging in a lamp. (pause) Okay, the lamp turns on, so the outlet's fine.

Agent: Good, so the outlet has power. That tells me the issue is likely with the modem itself or with the connection coming into your home. Let me check something on our end here. (typing sounds) David, are you able to see if there's any damage to the fiber optic line that comes into your house? Like outside near where it connects?

Customer: Uh, I could go look, but... I'm not really sure what I'm looking for, to be honest.

Agent: That's fair. It would be a thin cable, probably about the size of a pencil, that comes from either a utility pole or from a box on the outside of your house. If you want to take a quick look and just let me know if anything looks obviously damaged or disconnected, that would be helpful.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Let me go check. (pause, background door noise) Alright, so I'm looking at the side of the house. I can see the... uh, the cable coming in. It looks... I don't know, it looks normal to me? It's connected to something on the wall. Nothing looks broken.

Agent: Okay, good. That's helpful. Go ahead and come back inside. (pause) Alright, so I've got a few possibilities here. One is that your modem might have just failed, which unfortunately can happen sometimes. The other possibility is that there's an issue with our equipment or the connection on the network side. Let me see if I can check the status of your connection here... (typing sounds)

Customer: Is there something wrong with the service in my area? You mentioned that earlier.

Agent: I did check and I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported, but let me look a bit deeper. (pause) Hmm, I'm actually not seeing your modem connecting to our network at all right now, which suggests that either the modem isn't powering on properly or there's an issue with the connection between you and us.

Customer: So what do I do? Is my modem dead?

Agent: It's possible. Let me try one more thing before we go down that road. Do you have a phone line that goes through your modem? Some people have their phone service bundled with—

Customer: No, no. It's just internet. Just the internet service.

Agent: Okay, that simplifies things. Alright, I'm going to try to send a restart signal to your modem from our end. This sometimes can wake things up. Let me try that. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I've sent the command. Can you watch the modem and let me know if anything happens?

Customer: (pause) Nothing. It's still dark. Still nothing.

Agent: (sigh) Yeah, unfortunately I'm not seeing any response. And I've tried reconnecting you on my end as well. Let me be honest with you, David—at this point it's looking like your modem might have experienced a failure. That sometimes happens with hardware.

Customer: Great. So what now? How do I get it working again?

Agent: Well, we do have a couple of options. The first option is that we can ship you a replacement modem. That would take about 3 to 5 business days to arrive. The second option is if you want to try to come pick one up at one of our service centers, though I'm not sure what your local hours are. And actually, I should mention there would be a fee for replacing the equipment if it's been damaged by external factors, but if it's just a hardware failure on our end, we can replace it at no charge.

Customer: How much would it cost me if... you know, if there is a fee?

Agent: For equipment replacement, it's typically around $99, but I want to be clear—if this is just a standard modem failure, which it appears to be, there shouldn't be a charge. The fee would only apply if there was damage from, say, a power surge or water damage or something external like that.

Customer: Okay. I mean, I don't think I did anything to it. It just stopped working.

Agent: I believe you. In that case, I don't anticipate there would be a fee. But I do need to let you know upfront that there is the potential for that charge if our team finds something unusual when they process the replacement.

Customer: Right. Yeah, okay. So how long did you say for shipping?

Agent: 3 to 5 business days. I can place that order for you right now if you'd like, and you should receive it pretty quickly. Once it arrives, the installation is usually pretty straightforward—just plug it in and it should connect automatically to your account.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Let's do it. I need this fixed as soon as possible. I work from home, so...

Agent: Understood completely. I'll get that shipped out to you right away. Let me just confirm the address on file. I have 447 Maple Drive, Lakewood. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, and just to recap before I get this submitted—I want to make sure we've exhausted the troubleshooting steps. We've confirmed the power outlet works, the cables are secure, and I've tried to restart the modem from my end with no response. Is there anything else you think we should try?

Customer: (pause) I don't think so. I've tried everything I can think of, and you seem pretty confident it's the modem itself.

Agent: Yeah, at this point I'm fairly confident that's what we're looking at. Alright, I'm going to get this replacement order processed. You should receive an email confirmation within a few minutes. If you don't see it in the next 15 or 20 minutes, check your spam folder. You'll have a tracking number in that email. When the modem arrives, just plug it in and you should be back online. If for any reason it still doesn't work, definitely give us a call back and we can troubleshoot further.

Customer: Okay. Thanks for trying anyway, Marcus. I appreciate it.

Agent: Of course, David. I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online today, but hopefully this replacement gets to you quickly and gets you back up and running. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your patience today.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
