# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of. I'm working from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be, especially when you're working. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account for... is this James Peterson?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, James. So your internet is completely down right now, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, it's just... nothing. No lights on the router, nothing. Well, actually, there's one light that's kind of blinking red, I think.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The red blinking light usually indicates there's a connection issue. Let me walk you through some basic troubleshooting steps. First, can you locate your modem and router for me?

Customer: Yeah, they're right here on the shelf next to my desk. They're both Frontier equipment, I think.

Agent: Perfect. So what I'd like you to do is unplug the modem first—that's the larger box—and just wait about 30 seconds, then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging now... (pause) ...alright, it's unplugged. Should I wait the full 30 seconds?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and give it the full 30 seconds. That helps clear out the system.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) ...alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. While that's booting back up, let's also restart your router. Go ahead and unplug that one too.

Customer: (pause) Done. How long for this one?

Agent: Same thing, about 30 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, replugging... (pause) ...there we go.

Agent: Excellent. Now, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on the modem now?

Customer: (pause) Um... it's still got that red blinking light. Nothing's changed really. Maybe a green one that's steady?

Agent: Okay, so you've got a steady green and a blinking red. The green is good—that means it's powered on. But that red blinking light tells me the modem isn't establishing a connection to our network. Let me check your account here for any service alerts or issues on our end.

(typing sounds) (pause)

Agent: I'm not seeing any widespread outages in your area, but let me check your specific line. Can you give me your service address?

Customer: It's 2847 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B, in Henderson.

Agent: (typing) 2847 Maple Drive, 3B... Alright, I'm looking at your line now. Everything looks fine on our end. I'm going to ask you to try a few more things. Can you check the cable connections on the back of your modem?

Customer: Yeah, let me... (pause) ...okay, I'm looking at it. I see a couple of cables plugged in. One looks like it goes to the wall.

Agent: Right, that's the coaxial cable coming from the wall outlet. Is that one connected pretty firmly?

Customer: (pause) Um, it looks like it's connected... wait, hold on. Let me see if I can... (pause) ...actually, it's a little loose. Let me tighten it.

Agent: Good catch. Sometimes these can work themselves loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, tightening it now... (pause) Alright, it's tighter now. Anything else?

Agent: Let's give it another minute for the modem to reconnect. While we wait, are you seeing any other changes in the lights?

Customer: (pause) Um... no, still the same red blinking.

Agent: Okay. Let me try something from our end here. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem. Just give me one second. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I've sent that through. That can take about 30 seconds to process.

Customer: Okay, I'm watching it... (pause) ...still red.

Agent: Still red?

Customer: Yeah. Still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Alright, that's unusual. Let me ask you this—are you in an apartment complex?

Customer: Yeah, like I said, 3B. Why?

Agent: Just checking. Sometimes in apartment buildings there can be splitters or issues with the shared line. Have you noticed this problem before, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. I've had Frontier for like two years and it's been pretty solid until now.

Agent: Okay, good to know. Um... (pause) ...let me try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem again and just leave it unplugged for about two minutes this time?

Customer: Two minutes? That's longer than before.

Agent: Yeah, I know it's a bit longer, but sometimes a full reset like that can help. And while we're waiting, I'm going to check some deeper diagnostics on your account.

Customer: (pause) Alright, unplugging it again. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Okay... (pause) James, I'm looking at your modem's signal levels and they're reading as [inaudible] on our end, which is... it's odd because that usually means the modem isn't even communicating with the network.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It might be the modem itself, or there could be an issue with the line coming into your apartment. (pause) Go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging back in... (pause) Okay, it's in.

Agent: (pause) Is the light still red?

Customer: (pause) Yeah... yeah, it's still that same red blinking light.

Agent: (sigh) Alright, James, I'm going to be honest with you—I'm not able to get this resolved over the phone. The modem isn't responding to any of my signals, and the connection diagnostics aren't showing what they should be. I think we're looking at either a hardware issue with the modem or something with the line itself.

Customer: So what do I do? I need my internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. What I can do is schedule a technician to come out to your apartment. They'll be able to physically check the connection and either repair it or replace your modem if that's the issue. How does your schedule look? We have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have afternoon slots after 2 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would work. That's Friday, right?

Agent: Yes, tomorrow is Friday. I can get you scheduled for the morning window, 8 AM to 12 PM. Is that okay?

Customer: Yeah, that works. Do they usually show up early or late in that window?

Agent: It varies, but I'd recommend being available sometime during that window. They'll try to hit it as efficiently as possible. Let me get that scheduled for you here... (typing sounds) ...okay, I have you down for tomorrow morning. Your confirmation number is 447829. Is there anything else I can help with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just... I really hope they can fix it tomorrow because I have client calls scheduled.

Agent: I understand. The technician should be able to resolve this, and if for any reason they can't, they'll stay with it until we get you back online. You'll also get a courtesy call 30 minutes before the technician arrives.

Customer: Okay, thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Sorry we couldn't fix this remotely today, but we'll get you taken care of tomorrow. Thanks for calling Frontier.

Customer: Yeah, no problem. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
