# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, so my internet just went out completely. I've been without service for like the past hour and I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me just... alright, I'm seeing your account here. And you said your internet is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. I've got nothing. I tried unplugging the modem and router but still nothing.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on trying that already. Let me ask you a few questions. Are you seeing any lights on the modem right now? Any lights at all?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) Yeah, there's a light. It's... I think it's red? Or maybe orange? I'm not super close to it.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing a red or orange light. That's helpful. Can you tell me what port that light is on? Is it near the power button?

Customer: (pause) I mean, there's a light on top of the modem and then... yeah, I see like, a couple lights actually. One on top and one on the side. The one on the side is the one that's lit up.

Agent: Alright. So the side light—that's likely your internet light. And when you say it's red or orange, red typically indicates no connection. Let me have you do something for me. Can you unplug the modem for about thirty seconds and then plug it back in?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (longer pause) Alright, it's unplugged. I'll just wait a second here...

Agent: Perfect. Just give it about thirty seconds to fully discharge.

Customer: (pause) Okay, thirty seconds... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) It's starting up. There's some beeping. (pause) Okay, lights are... the lights are going through their startup sequence, I think.

Agent: Good, that's normal. Let me know once those lights stabilize. It usually takes about a minute or two.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the lights are still cycling through. (pause) Okay, now... yeah, I'm still seeing that orange light on the side.

Agent: (typing sounds) Still orange? Alright. Can you also check your router for me? Is that powered on?

Customer: Oh, the router. Yeah, it's right next to the modem. Let me... (pause) Yeah, it's powered on. I can see the lights on that too. Those are... those look kind of blue and green.

Agent: Okay, those are probably normal. But what I'm concerned about is that modem light. Let me check something on my end. (pause) I'm seeing that your line is showing as active, so that's good. But let me ask you—when did this start happening? Was there a storm or anything unusual before it went out?

Customer: A storm? No, no storm. It was just... I was working and then I just realized I had no internet. No warning or anything. One minute I was on Zoom and the next minute, gone.

Agent: Okay. So you dropped off Zoom right when it happened?

Customer: Yeah, exactly.

Agent: Let me try a few things here. (typing sounds) I'm going to send a signal to your modem to see if that helps reestablish the connection. Just... just bear with me for one second. (pause) Alright, I've sent that through. Do you see any changes on the modem?

Customer: (pause) Um... no, I don't think so. Same orange light still.

Agent: Alright. Let me have you try something else. Can you look at the back of the modem and tell me if all the cables are plugged in?

Customer: (pause) The back? Okay, let me... (pause) Yeah, I see cables. There's like, the power cable, and then... (pause) I think I see two other cables? One's coming from the wall and one's going to the router.

Agent: Okay, two cables besides the power. One from the wall—that's your line—and one to the router. Those should both be pretty secure. Can you give those a gentle tug? Just make sure they're firmly seated?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm pulling on them. They feel pretty secure... wait, hold on, let me try the one from the wall. (pause) Hmm, actually that one feels a little... I'm turning it and... okay, it feels like it was a little loose. Let me try tightening it. (pause) Okay, it's tightened.

Agent: Oh, good catch! Let me have you check the modem in about thirty seconds to see if that did anything.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so just wait thirty seconds?

Agent: Yeah, that should be enough time for it to register. Go ahead and wait.

Customer: (longer pause) ...Okay. Looking at it now. (pause) No, the light is still orange.

Agent: (pause) Still orange. Alright. Let me... (typing sounds) Let me pull up some more information here on your account. (pause) I'm going to ask you something—have you experienced any outages in your area recently? Or is this the first time?

Customer: No, no outages that I know of. The internet has been working fine until today.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. (pause) Alright, I think what we might be dealing with here is either an issue with the line itself or possibly the modem has developed a fault. Let me try one more thing. Can you access the router directly? Do you have a mobile phone you could connect to the WiFi to test?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I have my phone. Let me... (pause) Okay, looking for WiFi networks. (pause) I see my network name here but... (pause) it's showing as "no internet" when I try to connect. Like, it connected to the network but there's no internet coming through.

Agent: Okay, so the WiFi network itself is broadcasting, but there's no data getting through. That tells me the issue is on the modem side—it's not receiving a signal from the line. (pause) I think at this point we might need to have a technician come out to check the line and potentially replace the modem. These devices do have a lifespan and sometimes they just fail.

Customer: Oh man, really? So you can't fix this remotely?

Agent: I wish I could. I've done all the standard troubleshooting—power cycle, cable checks, the modem signal test. The fact that the modem light isn't turning blue and the device isn't establishing a connection suggests something more physical going on, either with the modem itself or the line coming into your home.

Customer: Okay, so what's the next step then? How soon can you get someone out here?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our technician availability. What would be your preferred time window? Would morning or afternoon work better for you?

Customer: Um, morning would be better if possible.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me see what we have. I can get someone out to you tomorrow morning between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works. (pause) And they'll be able to fix this?

Agent: They'll be able to diagnose the issue for sure. If it's the modem, they'll have a replacement. If it's a line issue, they'll repair that. But yes, they'll get you back online. Can I confirm your address?

Customer: Yeah, it's 447 Maple Drive, apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. So to confirm, we have you scheduled for tomorrow morning, 8 to 12. You'll get a confirmation text and email here shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: No problem at all. Sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone, but our tech will get you sorted out. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Alright, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
