Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back on. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get this sorted out. Can I grab your account information real quick? I'll need your phone number or account number associated with your service.

Customer: Yeah, it's... um... (pause) 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. And can I get the last name on the account?

Customer: It's Martinez. M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. Alright, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. So you mentioned the internet went out about an hour ago—did anything happen before that? Like a storm, or did you notice any changes?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine and then it just... stopped. The modem's not showing any lights or anything. It's just completely dark.

Agent: Okay, so the modem has no lights at all. That usually indicates a power issue. Let me ask you—is the modem plugged into an outlet right now?

Customer: Yeah, it is. I can see the plug going into the wall, so...

Agent: And that outlet is working fine? Like, if you plugged something else into it, it would turn on?

Customer: Hmm, good question. Let me... (pause) ...yeah, I just plugged in a lamp and it works, so the outlet is fine.

Agent: Great, okay. So the outlet has power. Let's try a different approach then. Can you locate the power cable that goes from the outlet to the modem?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I see it.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and disconnect that for me. Just pull it straight out of the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's out.

Agent: Good. Now, can you wait about thirty seconds? I want to make sure we completely drain the power from the device.

Customer: Sure. (long pause) Should be good now.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged back in. (pause) Still nothing. No lights.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me ask—is there a power button on the modem itself? Sometimes there's a small button on the front or the back.

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) Let me look... I don't think so? I'm looking at it right now and I just see the port holes, you know, for the cables, but I don't see a button.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. Sometimes they don't have them. The Fiber modem you have should power on automatically once it's plugged in. The fact that it's not showing any lights is a bit unusual. Can you check to see if the cable running from the wall into the modem is secure? Sometimes the connection gets loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm checking... it looks pretty tight to me, but let me try wiggling it just to be sure.

Agent: Good idea.

Customer: (pause) Nope, still nothing. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand. Let me try a couple more things. Is your router separate from your modem, or do you have a combo unit?

Customer: I think it's separate? There's like two boxes. One is smaller and kind of gray, and then there's a bigger white one.

Agent: Okay, so you do have two separate units. The gray one is likely your modem and the white one is the router. Let me have you check the router. Is it powered on? Are there any lights on that one?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, actually, the router has some lights. There's like a... a power light that's on. But I don't think I'm getting internet because my phone isn't connecting to the Wi-Fi.

Agent: Alright, so the router has power but your devices aren't connecting to Wi-Fi. That actually tells me the modem—that gray box—is the issue. Since the modem isn't powering on, the router can't connect to the internet to broadcast Wi-Fi. (pause) Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) Looking at your account, I'm not seeing any service outages in your area right now. Do you have any other cables you could try? Maybe a different power cable?

Customer: Hmm, I might have one upstairs. Do you think that could be it?

Agent: It's possible. Power cables can go bad sometimes. If you have another one around, we can definitely try that.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause - background sounds of moving around) I found one. It's not exactly the same but it looks pretty similar. Let me try it. (pause) Plugging it in now... (longer pause) Nope. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, so even with a different cable there's no response from the modem. At this point, I'm thinking we might be looking at a hardware failure. The modem itself could be defective. But before we go down that road, let me try one more thing. Sometimes if there's an issue with the line, it can present this way. Do you see a small reset button on the modem? It might be recessed into the device.

Customer: Let me look... (pause) I really don't see anything like that. Just these little holes basically. I don't think there's a reset button.

Agent: Alright. Well, given everything we've tried here, I think what we're looking at is a potential hardware failure on the modem itself. I'd like to get a technician out to your location to either repair or replace the unit. (pause) Before we do that though, let me check your service one more time and see if there's anything on our end that might be affecting this. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any issues on the network side. The line shows active, so it's not a service interruption or anything like that.

Customer: So what does that mean? Do I really need a technician?

Agent: Yeah, I think that's the next step. The modem should be powering on, and since it's not responding to any of our troubleshooting steps—power cycle, different cable, different outlet—it's very likely a hardware issue. A technician can assess it in person and get you back online. Do you have availability for someone to come by, say, tomorrow or the next day?

Customer: I mean... (pause) I guess. How long does that usually take?

Agent: Typically, a technician visit is between two and four hours. We can give you a specific window when I schedule it. Let me get you into our system here. (typing sounds) (pause) What does your schedule look like tomorrow?

Customer: Uh, tomorrow I work until about five, so anytime in the morning or after six would work.

Agent: Perfect. I can get you scheduled for a morning appointment between eight and noon. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that should be okay.

Agent: Great. Let me just confirm everything before we wrap up. This is for 555-0147, Martinez, correct?

Customer: That's right.

Agent: Excellent. You're all set for tomorrow morning, eight to noon. Our technician will come out and take a look at your modem. In the meantime, there's unfortunately not much I can do, since the modem isn't responding. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone today.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I guess I'll just... wait until tomorrow then.

Agent: I know it's not ideal. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
