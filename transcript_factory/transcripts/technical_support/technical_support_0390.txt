Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I'm supposed to be working from home today and I can't even connect.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. We'll get this figured out for you. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what name is this account under?

Customer: It's under Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got you here. Says here you're on our Fiber 200 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Alright. So let's troubleshoot this together. First things first—can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Like, what happens when you try to connect?

Customer: Well, when I turn on my laptop, the WiFi network doesn't even show up. Like, there's no Frontier network available at all.

Agent: Okay, so the network's completely invisible. Have you tried restarting your router yet?

Customer: No, not yet. Where is it? I have it in my office upstairs.

Agent: Great, go ahead and unplug the power cable from the back of the router. We'll give it about thirty seconds and then plug it back in.

Customer: (background noise of footsteps) Okay, I'm unplugging it now. (pause) Just... waiting here. This is so frustrating, honestly. I had a meeting at nine.

Agent: I understand, Michael. This shouldn't take too long. Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: Plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, the lights are coming back on. I see the white light... and the blue one. Um, there's also a red light blinking on the bottom.

Agent: The red light, okay. That might be our indicator light. Give it another minute or so to fully boot up. While we're waiting, let me ask—have you had any recent power outages or storms in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine when I went to bed last night.

Agent: Alright. (pause) How's it looking now? Do you see the network popping up?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. Still just the red light blinking.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, try this—can you locate the small reset button on the back of your router? It should be a tiny, recessed button.

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's really small.

Agent: Right. Now, I want you to hold that down for about ten seconds while the router is powered on. That'll do a factory reset.

Customer: Wait, won't that mess everything up? Like my settings and stuff?

Agent: It will reset to factory defaults, but honestly, we might need to do that anyway. Let's try it and see if it helps us get you back online.

Customer: (hesitation) Okay, here goes. (pause) Holding it down... (pause) Okay, I'm letting go.

Agent: Great. The lights should go through a restart cycle now. This might take a minute or two.

Customer: (pause) Okay, they're cycling through. I see them blinking different colors now.

Agent: Perfect. That's normal. While we wait, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Michael, is there any chance you've seen any notices from us about maintenance in your area?

Customer: No, I don't think so. I didn't get any emails or anything.

Agent: Okay, nothing on our end either. (pause) Alright, how are those lights looking now?

Customer: Um... they're back to the white and blue. But that red light is still there, just slower now.

Agent: That red light—that's what I'm concerned about. That's typically a signal light. Is there any chance the fiber line itself got disconnected? Like, do you see the cable running into your router?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's like a really thin cable coming in from the wall. Looks fine to me.

Agent: Can you kind of give it a gentle tug, just to make sure it's seated all the way in the port?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that. (pause) I mean, it seems pretty tight already, but... (pause) Okay, I gave it a tug. The red light is still there though.

Agent: Yeah, I was hoping that would do it. Let me try something else here. Can you tell me—when you look at your router, do you see a power button separate from just the plug?

Customer: No, I just see the plug on the back.

Agent: Alright. Can you unplug it completely, wait about two minutes this time, and then plug it back in? Sometimes these routers need a longer reset period.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, unplugging it again. (pause) This is taking forever. I really need to get online.

Agent: I totally understand. I know this is frustrating. We're going to get you back up and running though.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. I'll just... wait here for a couple minutes.

Agent: (pause) So Michael, how long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, um, about three years now? We've been pretty happy with it until now.

Agent: Great to hear. Well, let's make sure we keep you happy. Go ahead and plug that back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: Okay, plugging it in. (pause) The lights are coming back on. (pause) White light, blue light, and... yep, the red light is back again.

Agent: Okay, so the red light persists even after the longer restart. (typing sounds) I'm looking at a few things here. Michael, I'm actually seeing something on my end that might explain this. It looks like there could be an issue with the fiber signal coming into your location.

Customer: What do you mean? Like with the line outside?

Agent: Possibly, yeah. The signal we're receiving from your line isn't quite normal. Now, there could be a few things causing that—it could be the modem itself, or it could be something on the external side. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to you to do a physical inspection.

Customer: A technician? How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our schedule. (typing sounds, pause) Alright, it looks like we can get someone out to you on... (pause) we have an opening tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or the day after that between 9 AM and noon. What works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need internet today though.

Agent: I understand, and I wish I had something sooner for you. The earliest available appointments are what I mentioned. Sometimes if it's a widespread outage we can get someone out faster, but this appears to be isolated to your location.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Okay, fine. Tomorrow afternoon then. The 1 to 5 window.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, we have a technician appointment set for tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM at your address on file. Is that still 1447 Ashford Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation call or text about an hour before the technician arrives. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess not. This is just really disappointing. I really needed to work today.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Once our technician gets out there, we should have you back up and running. And just so you know, if this ends up being something on our end, we'll make sure to credit your account for the downtime.

Customer: Okay, well, I appreciate that at least.

Agent: Thank you for your patience, Michael. Again, you're all set for tomorrow. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. We'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
