# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Uh, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get this fixed. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. Last name is Richardson.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Richard Richardson at 555-0147. Got it. And just to confirm, you're completely without internet at the moment, correct?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. The modem's not doing anything. It's just... there's no lights or anything.

Agent: Alright, no lights on the modem. That's usually our first indicator. Let's try some basic troubleshooting. First, can you locate your modem and router setup for me?

Customer: Yeah, it's right here next to my TV. Um, I'm looking at it now.

Agent: Perfect. What I'd like you to do first is unplug the modem from the power outlet and just leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. That'll help us reset the connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. While that's disconnecting, I'm actually seeing here that we did have a brief service outage in your area this morning around 6 AM. Did you notice your internet go out around that time?

Customer: Oh! Yeah, actually, now that you mention it, yeah. It was around then. I thought maybe it came back on, but I guess it didn't fully restore or something.

Agent: That could definitely be it. Sometimes when service comes back online, devices don't always reconnect properly. So go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it in. (pause) Should I wait for something to happen?

Agent: Yeah, give it about a minute. You should start seeing some lights come on. Usually there's a power light first, then you'll see the internet connection light. Can you tell me when you start seeing lights?

Customer: (pause) ...I see a power light now. It's... it's green.

Agent: Excellent. Okay, and now we're waiting for the internet light. That's usually labeled with like a globe or WiFi symbol.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, that one's not coming on. The power's green, but... nothing else is happening.

Agent: How long has it been since you plugged it back in?

Customer: Maybe like... forty seconds?

Agent: Okay, let's give it another thirty seconds or so. Sometimes it takes a minute and a half to fully boot up after being reset.

Customer: (pause) ...Still nothing. Just the green power light.

Agent: Alright, I see. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) Can you tell me, do you have a separate router or is that all in one unit?

Customer: It's all in one. That's what they installed when they set up my service.

Agent: Okay, got it. And there's no blinking lights or any activity at all besides the power light?

Customer: No, it's just sitting there. The power light's solid green but nothing else.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let's try a different approach. Can you check the back of the modem for me? There should be a small reset button. It might be recessed or it might be labeled "reset."

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's like a little hole with "Reset" written next to it.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to have you hold that reset button down for about ten seconds. You might need a pen or paperclip to reach it. That's going to do a complete factory reset on the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... (pause) ...let go. How long should I wait this time?

Agent: Give it another minute and a half, maybe two minutes this time. This is a deeper reset so it might take a little longer to come back.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay. (long pause) Still nothing. Just the power light again.

Agent: Just the power light still?

Customer: Yeah. I'm looking right at it. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Alright. Let me pull up some additional diagnostics on this. One second. (pause, typing sounds) Have you experienced any recent storms or power fluctuations in your area?

Customer: No, I don't think so. I mean, there was some rain earlier but nothing crazy.

Agent: Okay. And is the modem hot to the touch at all? Or making any unusual sounds?

Customer: (pause) No, it feels normal. No sounds.

Agent: That's good at least. Okay, let me try something. Can you unplug the power cable from the modem itself—not from the wall, but where it connects to the modem—and just check if there's any visible damage or corrosion on the connector?

Customer: (pause) Let me see... No, it looks fine. The connector looks clean and normal.

Agent: Alright. Let me check on our end if there's a signal actually reaching your equipment. (typing sounds, pause) I'm... hmm. (pause) I'm getting a reading that we might not be getting proper signal to your address at the moment.

Customer: Wait, what does that mean? Is it the outage still?

Agent: It could be. The outage this morning shouldn't have left a signal issue, but sometimes when service restores, it doesn't always restore evenly across the network. It's also possible there's an issue with the line coming into your home. Have you noticed anything outside? Like any loose cables or lines near your home?

Customer: I haven't looked. Do I need to go check?

Agent: Could you take a quick look for me? Usually the cable comes in from a pole or from the side of your house.

Customer: (pause, background noise of door opening and closing) Okay, uh... I don't see anything obviously wrong. The cable's still connected where it goes into my house.

Agent: And it's not loose or damaged or anything?

Customer: No, looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay. I appreciate you checking. (pause) Unfortunately, what I'm seeing suggests that there might be a signal issue on our line side, potentially somewhere between our network and your home. That's not something we can fix over the phone with troubleshooting.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, I need to wait for the outage to fully clear up?

Agent: Well, there's a couple possibilities. Either the outage is still affecting your area and should clear up on its own, or there could be a physical issue with the line that would require a technician to come out and check. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds, pause) I can schedule a technician visit for you. We have an opening tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we have Thursday morning available as well.

Customer: Tomorrow works. But... is there anything else we can try right now? My boss is going to be pretty upset if I can't get online before then.

Agent: I understand. Let me... (pause) let me go through one more thing. Can you actually pull up the modem model number for me? It should be on a label on the back of the device.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it says, uh, Frontier Model FG-2000 something... FG-2070, I think?

Agent: (typing) Okay, FG-2070. Let me see if there's a known issue with that model... (pause, longer pause) Okay, so nothing obvious is coming up. And just to confirm one more time—no lights at all except that solid green power light?

Customer: That's correct. Just the power.

Agent: I wish I had better news, but at this point I think we really do need to have someone come out and check the physical connection. It could be a straightforward fix once the tech gets here, but I can't diagnose it remotely with what we're seeing.

Customer: (sighs) Okay. So what time tomorrow should I expect someone?

Agent: I can put you down for the 1 to 5 PM window tomorrow. That way you have a full window. The tech will either call or text you when they're on their way. Can I get a contact number for that?

Customer: It's the same number as the account, 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. So I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM. I'm putting a note on the account that this is a signal issue at the line level. The technician will see that when they arrive.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything I should try in the meantime?

Agent: You can leave the modem unplugged and just plug it back in again first thing tomorrow morning. Sometimes overnight that helps. But honestly, if the signal isn't reaching us properly, I don't expect that to resolve it.

Customer: Okay. Well, I guess that's all I can do then.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today. The good news is these kinds of issues are usually pretty quick fixes once we can get a technician there to check the physical connection. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thank you, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for being patient with me, and we'll get you sorted out tomorrow. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
