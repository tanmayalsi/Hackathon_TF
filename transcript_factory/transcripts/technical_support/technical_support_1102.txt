Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got a work deadline today and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that can be, especially when you need it for work. Let me pull up your account here and we can get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And can I have the name on the account?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account pulled up now. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router at all? Are they powered on?

Customer: Uh, yeah, actually, let me look. (background noise) So I've got the modem right here next to my desk. The power light is on, but... hmm, I don't see the internet light. That's not good, right?

Agent: Okay, that's actually helpful information. The internet light being off usually means the modem isn't connecting to our network. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just completely disconnect it from power.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Done.

Agent: Great. And while that's unplugged, can you also unplug your router if you have one separate from the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I've got a router over here. Unplugging that too. (pause) Okay, both unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about 30 seconds to let everything fully power down. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (background noise of plugging in) Okay, it's plugged back in now.

Agent: Good. You should see some lights coming back to life on it. Just give it a moment to boot up—that usually takes about a minute or so. While we're waiting, have you had any weather issues in your area? Any storms recently?

Customer: No, actually, it's been pretty clear. Been nice out all week. Why, does that affect it?

Agent: Sometimes storms can damage the equipment or the line connection, but if you haven't had any weather, that's good. Okay, what are you seeing on the modem now?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...power light's on, but I'm not seeing that internet light come back up yet. It's been like... maybe 45 seconds?

Agent: Let's give it a little bit longer. Sometimes it can take up to two minutes. In the meantime, go ahead and plug your router back in.

Customer: Alright. (plugging sounds) Router's back in.

Agent: Thanks. (pause) Okay, how about now? Any change on the modem?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. The internet light is still dark. Is that... is that bad?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It might be a connection issue on our end, or it could be the modem itself. Let me try a couple more things. Can you tell me what model modem you have? There should be a label on the back or bottom.

Customer: Let me flip it over here. (background noise) Okay, it says... Frontier model FX-2000.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, FX-2000. That's one of our newer models. James, I'm going to have you do what we call a factory reset on the modem. This will clear out any settings that might be causing the issue. What I need you to do is locate the reset button. It's usually a small button, might be recessed.

Customer: Yeah, I see a little button on the back. It says "Reset" right on it.

Agent: Perfect. I want you to hold that button down for about 10 seconds. You should see the lights start flashing when you do it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it down... (pause) ...yeah, I see lights flashing. That's a good sign, right?

Agent: It is, actually. That means the modem is resetting. Let's give it about three to five minutes to fully restart and reconnect to our network. During this time, the lights might do a few different things—they might blink, turn off, turn back on. That's all normal.

Customer: Okay, so I just... wait?

Agent: Exactly. Just give it a few minutes and we'll check in. While we're waiting, let me see if there's anything on our end that might be causing an issue. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure, no problem.

Agent: (hold music playing, then background sounds of agent typing) Okay, I'm back. I've checked our network on your line and everything looks normal from our side. The connection should be active. Let's check on that modem now. Are you seeing any changes?

Customer: (pause) Hmm, let me look. The power light is still on, but... no, the internet light still isn't on. This is weird.

Agent: Yeah, that is odd. Okay, let me try something else. I'm going to send a reboot signal to your modem from here. That might help reconnect it. Give me just a second. (typing sounds) Okay, I've sent that through. Give it about 30 seconds and tell me if anything changes.

Customer: (pause) I'm watching it... (pause) ...nope, nothing. Still the same. Why isn't this working?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Unfortunately, when the internet light isn't coming on after a reset and a remote reboot, it usually indicates either a problem with the modem itself or potentially an issue with the line coming into your house. Let me ask you something—do you remember if the modem was working fine yesterday?

Customer: Yeah, it was working great yesterday. No problems at all. This just happened overnight, basically.

Agent: Right, and you haven't done anything with the equipment or any cabling around the modem?

Customer: No, nothing. I didn't touch anything.

Agent: Okay. James, I think we might need to get a technician out to your location. This could be a line issue that we can't diagnose over the phone, or it could be that the modem has a hardware failure. Unfortunately, those are things that need to be looked at in person. Would you be available for a technician visit today?

Customer: (sighs) Today? I really... I have a deadline. How long would that take? How long before someone could even come out?

Agent: Let me check our technician availability for your area. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so we have same-day availability, but the earliest window I'm seeing is between 2 PM and 6 PM today. Does that work for you?

Customer: I mean, it's not ideal, but I guess I don't have much choice, right? That's the only option?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. That's our earliest availability. I wish I could get someone out sooner. But a technician will be able to diagnose the exact issue and either repair or replace the modem if needed.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Go ahead and schedule that.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to set that up for you. The window is 2 PM to 6 PM today. A technician will come to your home. Before they arrive, is there anything you want me to note on the account? Any specific access issues or anything I should mention?

Customer: No, I think I'm home all day anyway. Just... hopefully they can get this working quickly.

Agent: I completely understand. I've scheduled the service appointment. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes with all the details. The technician will have your number too and might call about 30 minutes before they arrive so you know what to expect.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that.

Agent: James, I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. The technician will take care of you today. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, at least.

Agent: Of course. I apologize again that we couldn't troubleshoot this further. Your appointment is all set for today, and we'll get you back up and running as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you later today.

Customer: Okay, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
