Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried restarting the modem and everything.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that is. Let me pull up your account here and we can get this sorted out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now... Alright, I've got you here. I'm showing your account is in good standing. So the modem is restarted, that's good. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you seeing any lights on the modem right now?

Customer: Uh, yeah. There's like... the power light is on, but the internet light—the one that's usually green—that's not lit up at all.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. So no green light on the internet connection. And when you say you restarted it, did you unplug it completely, or did you just hit the reset button?

Customer: I unplugged it and waited like... I don't know, maybe thirty seconds? Then I plugged it back in.

Agent: Good. Okay. Um, let me check something real quick. Can you look at the back of the modem and tell me if all the cables are plugged in securely? Sometimes they can get loose or knock out if someone bumps into something.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm looking back here... The power cord is in. There's like a cable coming from the wall—that's plugged in. And then there's another one that goes to my router. That one's... yeah, that's plugged in too.

Agent: Alright, those all sound secure. Let me try something else. Can you unplug the modem again for me, but this time let's leave it unplugged for about two minutes? That'll do a full power cycle.

Customer: Two minutes? Okay. (pause) Yeah, I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Perfect. While that's running, let me just... (typing sounds) ...let me check on our end if there are any service issues in your area. What's your zip code?

Customer: 32789.

Agent: (typing) 32789... Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages in that area right now, which is good. That usually means it's something we can fix. Go ahead and plug that modem back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) Alright, it's back on.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about thirty seconds to boot up completely. While that's happening, can you tell me—have you had any storms recently, or anything unusual happen before the internet went out?

Customer: Not that I know of. I mean, it was kind of cloudy this morning, but no storms or anything. It just like... went out. One second it was working fine and then boom, nothing.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Do you happen to have any other devices connected right now that you can check? Like a phone or a tablet?

Customer: Um, yeah. My phone's right here. Let me see... (pause) Nope. No Wi-Fi. It's not picking up my network at all.

Agent: Okay, so nothing's connecting to the Wi-Fi. Are you looking at that green light on the modem now?

Customer: No, it's... it's still not on. All I've got is the power light. Everything else is dark.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Um, let me try one more thing here. I'm going to send a signal to your modem from our end. This should take about a minute. Just hold tight.

Customer: Okay, doing that now?

Agent: Yeah, it's processing. (pause) Okay, I'm sending that signal now. Let me know if you see any changes on the modem... anything lighting up or... 

Customer: (long pause) No, nothing's happening. It's the same as before.

Agent: Okay. And you're still seeing just that one power light?

Customer: Yeah, just the power light. That's it.

Agent: Alright, I'm gonna be honest with you—usually when we're not getting that internet light after a full power cycle and a remote signal, there's typically an issue with either the modem itself or the connection coming into your home from our line. It could be a few different things. I wish I had better news.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is my modem broken?

Agent: Well, it could be. Or it could be something on our end with the line running to your house. The best way to figure this out would be to get a technician out to your place to diagnose it in person. They can check the line coming in, test your modem, all that stuff.

Customer: (sighs) How long is that gonna take? I need my internet back up.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds) Okay, so I can get someone out there... it looks like we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning is better for me. I've got stuff to do Thursday.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. That's tomorrow, between 8 AM and 12 PM. Our technician will come out and get this fixed for you. Can I get a callback number to confirm that appointment?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as my account number.

Agent: Got it. You're all set. We'll send you a confirmation text and email with the appointment details. Just a heads up—the technician will likely need access to your modem and the point where the line enters your home, so just keep that area accessible, okay?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, no problem. Is there anything I can try in the meantime?

Agent: (pause) You know, honestly, we've tried the main things. Just leave it unplugged for another hour or so if you want—sometimes that can help—but if it doesn't come back, don't worry about it. The technician will take care of it tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone. But we'll have you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: Alright, you have a great day, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
