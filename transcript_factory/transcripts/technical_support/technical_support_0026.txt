# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your phone number or account number please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at the account here for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So you're saying your internet went down this morning. When exactly did you first notice it wasn't working?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 7 or 8 AM. I was trying to check my email before work and nothing was loading. I tried restarting the router but that didn't help.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on trying the restart already. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you seeing any lights on the front of your modem and router right now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, so the modem has a few lights on. There's like a green one and... I think a yellow one? And the router, um... (pause) the router's lights are all blinking red.

Agent: Okay, so the modem has some lights, but the router is showing red. That's helpful. When you say the lights are blinking red, are they all doing that or just certain ones?

Customer: I think... I think they're all blinking red actually. Yeah, pretty much all of them.

Agent: Alright, that's telling me there might be a connection issue between your modem and router. Let me have you try something. Can you unplug your modem completely? Just give it about 30 seconds and then plug it back in.

Customer: Okay, one sec... (background noise, pause) Yeah, I'm unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. I'm gonna wait... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Perfect. While that's booting back up, let me also have you do the same with the router. Go ahead and unplug that as well.

Customer: Sure thing. (pause) Okay, unplugged. (pause) Now I'm plugging it back in. So should I wait for everything to power up before I check?

Agent: Yes, definitely. Give it about two to three minutes and we should see those lights stabilize. While we're waiting, can I ask—have you had any recent storms in your area? Sometimes that can affect things.

Customer: (pause) No, actually the weather's been pretty clear. Um, one thing though—I did have a technician out here about... I dunno, maybe two weeks ago? Something about maintenance or updates or something?

Agent: Okay, that's useful information. Let me check those notes. (typing sounds) Okay yeah, I see we had a fiber line upgrade in your area recently. That shouldn't cause any issues, but let me just note that. Are the lights on the modem and router looking any different now?

Customer: Um... (pause) okay so the modem still has the green and yellow lights, but the router... the router is still showing all red. Still blinking.

Agent: Still red, okay. Hmm. Let me try a different approach here. Can you unplug the ethernet cable that connects your modem to your router? It should be the cable going from the back of the modem to the router.

Customer: (pause) Yeah I see it. (sound of unplugging) Okay, it's out.

Agent: Good. Now let me have you reconnect it, making sure it clicks all the way in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in... I can hear it click. Yeah, it's in.

Agent: (pause) Any change on those lights?

Customer: No, they're still... still all red. This is really frustrating. I have work I need to do.

Agent: I totally understand, and I apologize for this. Let me just double-check a few things on the back end here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay Robert, I'm not seeing any outages in your area currently, which is good news and bad news. It means the problem is isolated to your setup, but it also means we might need a technician to come out. Before we go down that road though, let me try one more thing. Can you tell me the model number on your modem? It should be on the back or bottom.

Customer: (pause) Uh, yeah, hold on... (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the back. It says... "Frontier Gateway G1100" I think? Or "1000"? The numbers are kinda small.

Agent: No problem. That's a standard modem for us. Robert, I want to try a factory reset on your modem. This will clear everything and start fresh, but it will take about 10 minutes to fully reboot. Are you able to wait that out?

Customer: Yeah, okay, if it'll fix it I can wait.

Agent: Alright, so on the back of the modem, you should see a small recessed button. You might need a paperclip. Just hold that button down for about 10 seconds while it's powered on, and it'll do a factory reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. I'm gonna grab a paperclip real quick... (background noise) (pause) Alright, I found one. Holding it down now. (pause) Okay, it's resetting. The lights are all going crazy.

Agent: That's completely normal. That's what we want to see. Now just let it sit for about 10 minutes, okay? The lights should eventually stop flashing and settle into a steady pattern.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, I'm looking at it now and... (pause) it's still blinking pretty fast. It's been like 15 minutes maybe.

Agent: Alright, let's give it another minute or two to be safe. While we wait, let me just ask—is your modem getting hot at all? That's something I want to make sure of.

Customer: (pause) No, it feels fine. It's not hot.

Agent: Okay, that's good. (pause) How about now? Any improvement?

Customer: (pause) Um... no, not really. I mean the lights have stopped going totally crazy but the router still has all red lights. The modem's lights seem stable now but... (trails off)

Agent: Okay, okay. So the modem seems to be okay now, but the router is still showing red. That actually tells me the issue might be specifically with the router itself, or the connection between them. Let me try having you manually set up the connection. Can you go to a computer and try to connect to the modem directly? Do you have any devices with an ethernet port?

Customer: I mean, I've got a laptop with an ethernet port. Let me grab that. (background noise) (pause) Okay, I'm plugging it in directly to the modem.

Agent: Perfect. Once you're connected, open a web browser and just let me know if any websites are loading at all.

Customer: (pause) Okay I'm trying Google... (pause) still loading... (pause) nope, it's not loading. [inaudible] completely hung up.

Agent: Alright, so even directly connected to the modem it's not working. That tells me the issue is actually coming from the modem side, not the router. Robert, I hate to say this but I think we're going to need to get a technician out there. The modem might have been damaged or is just no longer functioning properly.

Customer: (sighs) Really? How long is that gonna take?

Agent: Let me check our availability real quick. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I can get someone out there tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't anyone come out today?

Agent: Unfortunately we don't have any same-day appointments available, but tomorrow is the earliest I can get you scheduled. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay fine. Tomorrow between 12 and 4. That's the best you can do?

Agent: I'm afraid so. But I do want you to know that we'll cover the modem replacement at no charge since this appears to be a hardware failure. And I'm going to put a note on your account so the technician is aware of everything we've tried today.

Customer: Alright, I guess that's something. (pause) Okay, schedule me for tomorrow.

Agent: Perfect. I'm getting that all set up for you now. (typing sounds) You're all set for tomorrow, December 14th, between 12 and 4 PM. You should receive a confirmation email shortly and we can also send you a text reminder. Is the number on file 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell phone.

Agent: Wonderful. We'll send that confirmation text over. And Robert, thank you for your patience today. I really do apologize that we weren't able to get you back online remotely. The technician should have everything fixed up for you tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks for trying anyway I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. I'll see the technician tomorrow.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks for choosing Frontier, Robert, and again, sorry for the trouble.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
