# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, it's 555-0147. My internet's been down all morning and I really need to get it working.

Agent: I'm so sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. Can I get your name for verification?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. And just to confirm, you're calling from the service address, correct?

Customer: Yeah, I'm at home right now. The internet just... it's just completely down. No lights on the modem, nothing.

Agent: Alright, let's get you back online. No lights on the modem at all is a good starting point. First thing I want to have you do is check if the power cable is securely connected to the back of your modem. Can you take a look at that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me just... okay, I'm looking at it now. Uh, yeah, the power cable looks plugged in pretty tight to me.

Agent: Great. And is the other end plugged into a power outlet?

Customer: Yeah, it's in the outlet right there next to the TV. (pause) Wait, actually... let me check that outlet. I'm gonna plug a lamp in here... (background noise) Okay, the lamp turns on, so the outlet's working fine.

Agent: Good, good. That rules that out. So when you look at the modem, there should be a small reset button. Do you see that? Usually it's on the back and you might need a paperclip or something small to press it.

Customer: I see it. It's like... recessed in there, right?

Agent: Exactly. Go ahead and hold that reset button for about ten seconds. That'll do a full reset of the device.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... still holding... and... (pause) There we go, I see some lights starting to come on now. There's like a blue light.

Agent: Excellent! That's what we want to see. Now the modem needs a couple of minutes to fully boot up and establish connection. While we wait, let me ask you—have you had any recent power outages or storms in your area?

Customer: No, not that I know of. I mean, it was raining pretty hard yesterday, but nothing extreme.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Go ahead and check the lights now. What do you see?

Customer: (pause) Um, I'm seeing... there's the power light which is solid blue now. And I see an... internet light? That one's kind of flickering orange right now.

Agent: The orange flickering means it's still trying to sync. That should stabilize in the next minute or so. Can you try opening a browser on your computer or phone and see if you can access anything?

Customer: Yeah, let me try... (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm on my laptop. I'm gonna go to... Google. (pause) It's... it's not loading. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, and you're connected to the WiFi network, correct? You're seeing the Frontier network available?

Customer: Yeah, I'm connected. It says I'm connected right now, but the page won't load.

Agent: [inaudible] let me try one more thing. Can you try restarting your computer? Just power it down completely and bring it back up.

Customer: Sure, give me a sec. (pause) Restarting now... (pause, background noise) Okay, it's booting back up. (longer pause) And I'm logging back in... connecting to the WiFi again... (pause) Trying Google again and... (pause) no, still nothing. It's just spinning.

Agent: Hmm. And on the modem, what color is the internet light showing now?

Customer: It's still... it's orange and flickering. It hasn't changed.

Agent: Okay. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) David, I'm showing that there was a service disruption reported in your area yesterday morning. It's possible there's still some underlying issue with your line. Have you tried unplugging the modem for about thirty seconds and plugging it back in?

Customer: I reset it though, isn't that kind of the same thing?

Agent: It's similar, but sometimes a full power cycle helps more than a reset. It's worth trying.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now... I'll wait a minute... (pause, background noise) Alright, plugging it back in. (pause) And... waiting for it to boot up again. (longer pause) Okay, it's booting... lights are coming on... and... (pause) No, same thing. Orange flickering light, still no internet.

Agent: Unfortunately, it sounds like there may be an issue on our network side. The fact that it won't stabilize after both a reset and a full power cycle suggests it's likely not something we can resolve over the phone.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long is this gonna take?

Agent: What I'm going to do is I'm going to schedule a technician to come out to your location. They'll be able to check the line coming into your home and make sure everything's properly connected on our end. Are you available sometime tomorrow, or would you prefer the next day?

Customer: (pause) I mean, I need this working soon. Tomorrow would be better than the next day. What time?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) We have a window tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM available for your area. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that... that should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. Your confirmation number is going to be 847295. A technician will arrive between 8 AM and noon tomorrow. They'll have your phone number on file, but if anything comes up on your end, feel free to call us back and reference that number.

Customer: Okay, I got it. 847295. So... there's nothing else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: At this point, I'd just suggest keeping the modem powered on and maybe restart your computer one more time before bed tonight, just in case anything resolves overnight. But honestly, with that orange light not stabilizing, I'm fairly confident we're looking at a line issue.

Customer: Alright. I mean, I'm frustrated, but I appreciate your help trying to figure it out.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get this resolved for you tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, David. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good rest of your day, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
