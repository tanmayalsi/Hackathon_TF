Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm showing an account for a residential fiber connection at... 2847 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So your internet went down this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 7 AM. I tried unplugging the modem and router for like twenty minutes, but nothing. It's just... nothing. No lights, no connection.

Agent: Okay, let me start with some basic troubleshooting. Just to confirm, when you say there are no lights on the modem, is the power cable plugged in?

Customer: (pause) Well... let me check. Yeah, it's... it's plugged into the wall outlet.

Agent: And the outlet itself has power? Like, if you plug something else in there, does it work?

Customer: Oh. Hmm. (pause) Actually, no, it doesn't. Let me try a different outlet.

Agent: Good thinking. Why don't you do that and then let me know if the modem powers back on.

Customer: (pause) (sound of movement, something unplugging) Okay, so I'm plugging it into the outlet in my bedroom here. (pause) Wait... okay, yeah! I can see lights coming on. The modem's got lights now.

Agent: Excellent. Do you see the blue light on the front?

Customer: Uh, I see a blue light and... green, I think? Is that normal?

Agent: Perfect, that's exactly what we want to see. The blue and green lights mean it's connecting to the network. Give it about thirty seconds to fully boot up, and then check if you're getting internet on your devices.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm... I'm checking my laptop. No, still nothing. The WiFi network isn't showing up.

Agent: Alright, and how long has it been since you plugged it in?

Customer: Maybe like... forty-five seconds?

Agent: That's still pretty quick. These can take a minute or two to fully initialize. Let's give it another minute and then try again. While we wait, can you tell me what type of modem you have? Is it a gateway unit or separate modem and router?

Customer: It's all-in-one, I think? It's the white box Frontier provided.

Agent: That's what I figured. Okay, how about now? Are you seeing the network?

Customer: (pause) Still no. Should I... is there a button I need to press or something?

Agent: There might be a reset button, but let's not do that just yet. Let me check something on my end real quick. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a line test from here to see if there's service coming to your address. Just give me a moment.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) Alright, so the line test is coming back okay on this end. Your service should be active. Now, on the back of that modem, there's an Ethernet port. Do you have a computer or laptop that you could plug directly into with an Ethernet cable?

Customer: Um... I might have a cable somewhere. Give me a second. (background noise, shuffling) This might take me a minute. I've gotta find it.

Agent: Take your time, no problem.

Customer: (pause) (more shuffling) Okay, I found one. I'm plugging my laptop in now.

Agent: Great. What do you see?

Customer: (pause) Nothing yet. It's... still nothing. No connection.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me look at this from a different angle. When you have the modem plugged in, are you seeing any lights blinking on the back, or just on the front?

Customer: There's... (pause) Yeah, there's lights on the back too. I see a couple lights.

Agent: Okay, can you describe which lights are on and what color they are?

Customer: So the first one is red. Then there's a green one that's... kind of blinking? And I think there's a yellow one below that.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that red light is the issue. That typically indicates there's no connection coming into your modem from our network. When was the last time your internet was working properly?

Customer: Yesterday afternoon, I think? Everything was fine. I went to bed, and when I woke up this morning, it was just dead.

Agent: Understood. Let me check something. I'm going to see if there were any service interruptions in your area overnight. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any outages reported. However, we might be looking at a hardware issue with the modem or possibly an issue with the line coming to your house. Do you happen to see the exterior box where the fiber line connects to your home?

Customer: I... I don't really know where that would be. Is it outside?

Agent: It would be outside, yes. Usually on the side of the house or near where your electrical line comes in.

Customer: (pause) I'm not seeing anything like that. I mean, there's a lot of stuff on the side of the house. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for.

Agent: It's typically a small white or gray box. But if you're not comfortable going out there, that's okay. Let me try a different approach. I'm going to send a remote command to your modem to restart it. This might take a few minutes.

Customer: Okay, should I...?

Agent: Just stay on the line and keep an eye on that modem. In a minute or so, you'll see the lights go out and then come back on. That's normal.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see them going off now.

Agent: Good, that's exactly what should happen. Now we wait for them to come back on.

Customer: (long pause) They're back on. Do you... is it working now?

Agent: Let me check my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm still not seeing the connection established. That's... that's not a good sign. At this point, I think we might be looking at a hardware failure with the modem itself, or there could be an issue with the line that we'd need to have a technician come out and investigate.

Customer: Oh, man. So what does that mean? How long before someone can come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) The soonest I can get someone to you would be tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 6 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need this working today if possible. I have important stuff for work...

Agent: I understand completely, and I really wish I had something sooner. Our technicians are fully booked today. But I can put a note on your account that this is urgent, and if there's a cancellation, we can try to get someone out to you sooner.

Customer: (frustrated) This is... okay. Yeah, tomorrow afternoon I guess. That's... that's frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. We will get this sorted out. To confirm, tomorrow between 2 and 6 PM, and I'm noting this as high priority. Is there anything else I can help you with while we have you on the line?

Customer: No, I... I guess not. I just need to figure out how to work around this today.

Agent: I hear you. Well, we'll get that tech out there, and they should be able to diagnose exactly what's going on. If you need anything before then, feel free to give us a call back. You have a confirmation number for this appointment: it's FT-884291.

Customer: Okay, FT-884291. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this today. Have a good one.

Customer: Yeah, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
