Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. And just to confirm, you're experiencing no internet connection at all right now, correct?

Customer: Right, yeah. No connection. The router's still on—I can see the lights and everything—but there's just... nothing. I can't connect any of my devices.

Agent: Alright, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your router right now? Are they all green, or do you see any red or orange lights?

Customer: Um... let me go look at it. (pause) Okay, so the power light is green, the internet light is... it looks like it's orange or amber or something. And then I've got a couple other lights that are blinking.

Agent: Okay, good. So that amber light on the internet connection—that typically means there's an issue with the signal coming into your modem. Let's try a hard reset. Can you unplug the power cable from the back of your modem for about 30 seconds?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, unplugged. I'm waiting... (longer pause) Alright, it's been about 30 seconds. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Plugged it in. Now what?

Agent: Great. Let's give it about two minutes to boot back up and re-establish the connection. While we wait, I can check our system here to see if there are any outages in your area. What's your address on file?

Customer: It's 4821 Meadowbrook Drive, Apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 4821 Meadowbrook Drive, Apartment 3B. Let me see here... (pause) I'm not showing any active outages in your area right now. Have you checked if it's working yet?

Customer: No, let me... (pause) Nope, still showing that same orange light. Still no internet.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Sometimes these things take a little longer. Let me try another approach. Can you check the back of your modem and tell me—do you see a small reset button? It's usually recessed in a little hole.

Customer: A reset button? Yeah, I think... yeah, I see it.

Agent: Okay, that's going to do a factory reset, which will clear everything. We should really only do that as a last resort because you'll have to reconfigure your WiFi network. But before we get there, let's try something else. Can you also unplug the power cable from your router? That's the separate device.

Customer: I only have the one box. Is that... is that the modem?

Agent: Ah, okay. So you've got a combo unit—that's actually the modem and router combined. That's fine. So we already did the unplugging of that. Um, let me check your account to see if I'm showing a signal on our end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, that's strange. I'm not actually registering a connection to your equipment. That tells me we might be looking at a hardware issue or... or possibly something with the line coming into your apartment.

Customer: What do you mean, like the cable?

Agent: Possibly, yeah. Or it could be that your modem has failed. Can you check—do you see the cable coming into your modem from the wall? Is it firmly connected?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks pretty tight to me. I can see the cable going in.

Agent: Okay. And just out of curiosity—has anything happened recently? Any power outages, storms, anything like that in your area?

Customer: Not that I've noticed, no. Everything else seems fine. Just the internet.

Agent: Right. Okay, so I'm going to try one more thing from my end. I'm going to send a restart signal to your modem. Give me just a second. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I've sent that command. Can you check if anything changes?

Customer: (pause) Um... nope. Same thing. Still orange.

Agent: Yeah, I'm not seeing any improvement on our end either. I hate to say this, but at this point, I think we're looking at either a modem hardware failure or possibly a line issue that we'd need to investigate with a technician. I don't want to waste your time with more troubleshooting that isn't going to resolve this.

Customer: Oh man. So what does that mean? How long would it take to get a technician out here?

Agent: (pause) Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) What does your schedule look like? Are you available on... let's see... tomorrow?

Customer: Tomorrow? Not really, I'm working all day. What about Wednesday?

Agent: (typing sounds) Wednesday, we have availability in the morning between 8 and 12 PM. Or we have an afternoon slot between 1 and 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: The afternoon would be better. Can I do like 2 to 5?

Agent: I can book you for the 1 to 5 window, and the technician will contact you a little bit before they arrive to narrow down the time. But I can make a note on your account that you prefer the 2 o'clock hour.

Customer: Okay, yeah. That works.

Agent: Perfect. I'm getting that scheduled for you now. And I'm going to put a priority flag on this because you've been without service this morning. So we'll have someone out there on Wednesday between 1 and 5 PM. They'll be able to either repair or replace your equipment, or investigate the line if needed.

Customer: Alright. Is there... I mean, there's nothing I can do until then?

Agent: [inaudible] ...unfortunately not much else we can try remotely at this point. I mean, you could try that factory reset I mentioned—holding down that recessed button for 10 seconds—but honestly, given what I'm seeing on my end, I don't think it's going to help.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I'll just... I guess I'll just wait for the technician then.

Agent: I understand. And I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. I know it's inconvenient. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... make sure they actually show up on Wednesday, okay? I've had issues with that before.

Agent: I will absolutely make sure this is prioritized. Your appointment is confirmed for Wednesday, 1 to 5 PM, and I'm adding a note here. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly with all the details, and the technician will reach out a little before they arrive.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Thanks for choosing Frontier, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. We'll get you back up and running on Wednesday.

Customer: Alright, bye.

Agent: Have a good day.
