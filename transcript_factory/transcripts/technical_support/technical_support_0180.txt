# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull up your account here... Alright, I've got you. So your internet service went down this morning, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, exactly. I woke up this morning around seven and tried to check my email, and there's just... nothing. No internet at all.

Agent: Got it. And when you say no internet, do you see any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um... (pause) Well, there's the modem over there. Let me check. The power light is on, it's green. But the internet light, I think it's... it's not on. Or it's red? It's definitely not the normal blue color.

Agent: Okay, so the internet light is not showing normal. That's helpful. Let me ask you a couple quick questions. Have there been any storms in your area recently, or any power outages?

Customer: No, not that I'm aware of. It's been pretty clear all week actually.

Agent: Alright. And you haven't made any changes to your setup or moved the modem around?

Customer: No, no. It's been in the same spot for like two years. (pause) Do you think there's an outage in my area or something?

Agent: That's definitely possible. Let me check our system for any known outages... (typing sounds, pause) I'm not showing any active outages on your service address at the moment, but let's do a few things. First, I'm going to ask you to do a quick power cycle on your equipment. Can you unplug your modem for me?

Customer: Sure, yeah. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. I'll wait.

Customer: (background noise of shuffling) Okay... it's been a bit. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause, sound of plugging in) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now, can you tell me what lights you're seeing come up? Just describe them as they light up.

Customer: Okay, so... the power light came on right away, it's green. And now there's like a white light that's kind of blinking... and now I'm seeing the internet light come on and it's... it's red. Still red.

Agent: Hmm, okay. So the internet light is red even after the power cycle. That typically indicates either a connection issue or a problem with the modem itself. Let me check your modem's signal levels. (typing sounds, pause) 

Okay, I'm actually not seeing your modem connecting to our network right now. That could mean a few things. Let me walk you through this. Can you check the cable going into the back of your modem? The one that comes from the wall outlet?

Customer: Yeah, I can do that. (sounds of movement) Okay, so I'm looking at the back and... there are a couple cables here. Which one are you talking about?

Agent: Good question. Look for the one that says "Coax" on it, or it might just be a thick cable. Do you see it?

Customer: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see it. It's plugged in all the way.

Agent: Okay, can you unplug it and then plug it back in? Sometimes they can come loose.

Customer: (pause, sounds of movement) Alright, unplugging it... and plugging it back in. It's definitely tight now.

Agent: Great. And while you're back there, do you happen to see a battery backup unit or any other equipment connected?

Customer: No, it's just the modem and the router. That's it.

Agent: Okay, good. (pause) Let me give that a moment to resync... (pause) Can you tell me if the internet light has changed at all?

Customer: (pause) Um... no, it's still red. Still just blinking red.

Agent: Alright. Let me try one more thing. I'm going to do a full factory reset on your modem from my end. This should take a minute or two. Just keep watching it, okay?

Customer: Okay... (pause) ... waiting...

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, reset is initiating. Your modem is going to reboot completely.

Customer: I see the lights going off... and coming back on. The power light is green again, and... (pause, longer pause) ...okay, now the internet light is... it's still red. It's still blinking red.

Agent: (pause) Alright. I'm not seeing any connection from your modem still. At this point, I'm thinking we might be dealing with either a problem with the modem hardware itself, or there could be an issue on the line side that I can't detect remotely.

Customer: What does that mean? Like, can you fix it?

Agent: (pause) Well, that's the tricky part. Unfortunately, I'm not able to get your modem to sync with our network from here, and since you've done all the troubleshooting steps we can do remotely... 

Customer: So what do I do? I need my internet working. I have work calls this afternoon.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the frustration. What I'd like to do is get a technician out to your location to check the line and the equipment. They'd be able to physically test everything and see what's causing this issue. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I guess so. When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... The earliest we have is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that time window work?

Customer: Tomorrow? Really? I mean... (pause) ...I guess I don't have much of a choice, do I?

Agent: I know it's not ideal, and I'm sorry about that. Unfortunately, our technicians are pretty booked up today. But I'll get you scheduled for first thing in the morning.

Customer: Alright, fine. Tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, the phone number we have on file is 555-0147, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And they'll call you about thirty minutes before they arrive. Is there anything else I can help you with before I get you scheduled?

Customer: [inaudible] No, I guess not. Just... hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I really do hope so. I apologize we couldn't get it working today. We'll definitely get someone out there to sort this out. You're all set for tomorrow between 8 and 12. Is there a number they should call when they arrive?

Customer: They can just use the number you already have.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for your patience today, and again, I apologize for the trouble. We'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
