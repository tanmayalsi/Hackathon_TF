Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so my internet's been down since this morning and I can't figure out what's going on. I've got work calls coming up and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll see what we can do. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're saying your internet's been completely down since this morning?

Customer: Yeah, completely out. The modem's been on this whole time but nothing's connecting. I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, but that didn't help.

Agent: Good, I'm glad you already tried that. Let me just verify a couple things. Are you looking at the modem right now?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I can see it from where I'm sitting. It's in the other room but I can see the lights.

Agent: Okay, great. So can you tell me what lights you're seeing? Are they flashing, solid, or are some of them off?

Customer: Um... (pause) the power light is on, that's solid. And I see like... a red light that's blinking? And then there's another one that's... I think it's orange? That one's not doing anything.

Agent: Okay, so the red blinking light is actually a signal that there might be an issue with your connection. That's helpful. Let me just pull up your service status here. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing any outages in your area, so it's probably something we can troubleshoot. Have you tried restarting your modem yet?

Customer: I unplugged it earlier, yeah.

Agent: How long did you leave it unplugged for?

Customer: Maybe... thirty seconds? A minute?

Agent: Let's try leaving it unplugged for a full three minutes this time. That'll completely clear out the system.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Yeah, I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Perfect. While that's resetting, let me ask you a few other questions. Have there been any storms in your area recently? Or any kind of power fluctuations?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine. And the power's been steady.

Agent: Alright. And when exactly did you notice this stopped working? Was there anything happening right before?

Customer: This morning, I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing was loading. I thought maybe my computer was frozen or something, but then I realized the internet was just... gone.

Agent: Got it. Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (background noise) Alright, it's back in. (pause) Now I'm just... waiting for the lights to come back on.

Agent: That should take about a minute or so. While we're waiting, are you seeing any lights come on yet?

Customer: Yeah, the power light's back. (pause) And now there's a blue light that's... solid? Is that good?

Agent: That's actually a very good sign. That means your modem's connecting to our network. There should be an internet light that comes on next. Do you see anything else?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see... there's another light and it looks like it's coming on. It's blue.

Agent: Perfect. Is it solid or is it blinking?

Customer: (pause) It's... it's blinking. I think it's blinking.

Agent: Okay, so it's still trying to establish a connection. It might take another minute or two. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm showing your modem is online now, which is great. But let me just double-check that your gateway's getting a signal. Can you... actually, is your modem and router the same unit, or are they separate?

Customer: I think they're the same? It's just one device. It's the one Frontier gave me when we set up the service.

Agent: Okay, so it's an all-in-one modem and router. That's fine. So that light should go solid blue once it's fully connected. Why don't you try opening your browser and seeing if you can load a website now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me try. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm typing in a website... nothing's happening. It's still just... nothing's loading.

Agent: Alright, let's try a different approach. Can you open your phone or another device and try to connect to the WiFi network on your phone?

Customer: Oh, um... good idea. Let me see. (pause) Yeah, I'm seeing the network, but when I try to connect it's asking for a password and... [inaudible] I don't remember the password.

Agent: That's okay. You should see a sticker on the back or bottom of your modem that has the password on it. It might say WiFi password or network key.

Customer: (pause) Oh yeah, I see it. (pause) Okay, I'm typing it in. (pause) It says it connected, but when I try to open something... oh. Oh no, it's still not working. It's not actually loading anything.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Can you unplug the modem again? This time, let's try a factory reset.

Customer: A factory reset? What do I do?

Agent: So on the back of your modem there should be a small reset button. It might be recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something thin to press it. While the modem's unplugged, I need you to hold that button down for about ten seconds.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Yeah, I'm looking for it now. (pause) I found it, I think. There's a little hole back here.

Agent: That's the one. Go ahead and press it with a paperclip while it's unplugged.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I got a paperclip. (pause) I'm pressing it now and holding it. (pause) Okay, it's been about ten seconds.

Agent: Good. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Plugging it in now. (background noise) (pause) The lights are coming back on. (pause) We're doing the same thing as before, right?

Agent: Right. Let me know once you see all the lights stabilize and the internet light goes solid blue.

Customer: (pause) Okay... power's on. Blue light. Blue light is blinking again. (pause) (pause) Okay, I think both blue lights are solid now?

Agent: Great. Can you try to load a website now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me try. (pause) Still nothing. Still just sitting there. This is really weird.

Agent: I know this is frustrating. Let me check a few things on our end here. (typing sounds) (pause) So I'm showing your modem is online and it's registering on our network. The signal strength looks good too. (pause) Let me just check if there might be... hmm. (pause) Can you tell me what model modem you have? It should be written on the device somewhere.

Customer: (pause) Um... I'm looking. It says... Netgear? And then there's like a model number. N-G-something...

Agent: That's fine, that's one of our standard modems. Okay, so one more thing we can try. Can you restart your computer? Sometimes it's actually a device issue rather than a connection issue.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) I'm shutting it down now. This might take a minute.

Agent: No problem, I'll be right here.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's booting back up. (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, it's fully restarted. (pause) Let me try opening the browser again. (pause) Still nothing. It's not even trying to load. It's just blank.

Agent: Okay, um... (pause) let me try something different. Can you try to access your modem's admin page? You can do that by opening a browser and typing in 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1

Customer: Um... (pause) okay. (pause) I'm typing that in. (pause) Okay, I'm on some kind of page. There's a bunch of technical stuff.

Agent: Good. You should see like a status section somewhere. Can you look for anything that shows your internet connection status?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It says "Connection Status" and it's showing... [inaudible] red X next to "WAN Connection"? Is that bad?

Agent: A red X on the WAN connection is... that's actually the issue right there. That means the modem's not able to establish a connection to the internet even though it looks like it should be. (pause) Okay, so at this point, I think we might have a hardware issue with the modem itself, or there could be an issue with the line coming into your home.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you guys fix it?

Agent: (pause) Well, typically if it's the modem, we can send you a replacement. But if it's an issue with the line, we might need to send a technician out to check the connection. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm going to get you set up with a technician appointment. We have availability this Friday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM, or we have next Tuesday morning between 8 AM and noon. Which works better for you?

Customer: This Friday? That's... that's five days away. Do you have anything sooner? I really need my internet for work.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize. Unfortunately, those are the next available slots we have in your area. I know it's not ideal. (pause) Would Friday work, or would Tuesday be better?

Customer: (pause) Friday, I guess. Afternoon is better for me. Can I get like a 2 PM window or something?

Agent: I'll put you down for Friday afternoon. The technician will call you within the window to confirm an exact time. Does the number on your account still the best number to reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Alright. (typing sounds) I've got that scheduled for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess not. I'm just... I wish this could have been fixed faster, you know?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry we weren't able to resolve this today. But our technician on Friday should be able to get to the root of the issue and get you back online. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's... that's it I think.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Your technician will be out Friday afternoon. We appreciate your business, and again, sorry for the inconvenience.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
