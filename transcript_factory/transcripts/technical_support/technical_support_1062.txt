# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, so my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I have work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing your account here. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have you had any power outages in your area, or did anything change with your setup?

Customer: No, no power outages. Everything else in my house is working fine. I just... the router, I guess, the lights aren't coming on like they normally do. Usually there's a little green light, but it's just dark.

Agent: Okay, so the router lights are completely off. Got it. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. Can you check if the power cable is securely connected to the back of the router?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me see... (background noise of moving around) Okay, yeah, it's plugged in. It's connected to the wall outlet.

Agent: Good, good. And just to confirm, is there power going to that outlet? Like, is there anything else plugged in nearby that's working?

Customer: Um, yeah. I have a lamp right there that's on, so the outlet's fine.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so here's what I'd like you to do. Can you unplug the power cable from the back of the router, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in? That's called a power cycle, and it often resets things and gets them working again.

Customer: Okay, doing it now. (sound of unplugging) Thirty seconds, right?

Agent: That's right. Just... take your time, and once you plug it back in, we'll wait a minute or so and see if those lights come back on.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay... let's see... (longer pause) Hmm. Still nothing. The lights aren't coming back on.

Agent: Hmm, okay. No lights at all?

Customer: Nope. It's still completely dark. Nothing.

Agent: Alright, let me try something else. I'm going to have you check the back of the router. You should see a few cables connected back there. Can you describe what cables you see?

Customer: Yeah, there's, um... there's the power cable that we just worked with, and then there's like two other cables. One kind of looks like a phone line, maybe?

Agent: Okay, so there's a coaxial cable — that's the one that looks like a phone line but thicker — and is there an ethernet cable as well?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. There's one that's kind of flat and smaller.

Agent: Perfect. Can you check if that coaxial cable is secured tightly at both ends? Sometimes these can get loose.

Customer: (sound of rustling) Let me see... (pause) The one going into the wall seems pretty tight. And the one on the router... (pause) Wait, actually, this one feels a little loose. Let me tighten it.

Agent: Good catch. Go ahead and tighten that up.

Customer: (straining sounds) Yeah, I think I got it. It's tighter now.

Agent: Great. Let's try plugging the power back in and see if that makes a difference. Go ahead and unplug it again for me, wait those thirty seconds, and plug it back in.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Unplugging now... (pause) ...thirty... (pause) Plugging back in. (pause) (pause) ...Still nothing. No lights.

Agent: (pause) Okay, um. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm pulling up some diagnostics on your modem and router. (pause) So, I'm actually showing that there might be an issue with the signal coming into your home. The modem isn't registering a signal from our network.

Customer: Oh. What does that mean? Like, is it something on my end or your end?

Agent: That could be a few things. It could be an issue with the line coming to your house, or it could be that the modem itself is having a hardware failure. Since the power cycling didn't bring the lights back on at all, I'm leaning toward it being a hardware issue with the modem.

Customer: So... the modem's broken?

Agent: It's looking that way, yeah. But before we go down that road, let me try a couple more things. Have you noticed any physical damage to the modem at all? Any cracks, burns, anything like that?

Customer: (pause) No, not that I can see. It looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay. Um, I'm also going to want to make sure this isn't an issue on the line side. Can you walk me over to where your line comes into the house? Usually there's a box or a connection point on the outside of your house.

Customer: Uh, I'm not really comfortable going outside right now. It's raining pretty hard. Can't we figure this out from inside?

Agent: I understand. That's fine. We can work with what we have. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so looking at your account and the diagnostics here, I'm... I'm actually not picking up any connection to your device at all. And given that the modem's completely unresponsive with no lights, I'm pretty confident the modem has failed.

Customer: So what do I do? I need my internet back up today if possible.

Agent: I totally understand. So we have a couple options. One option is I can schedule a technician to come out and replace the modem for you. The next available appointment I have is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Or, if you wanted to, you could come pick up a replacement modem from one of our local Frontier stores today, though I'd need to verify one is nearby.

Customer: (sighs) Tomorrow? I really need it today. Can't someone come out sooner than that?

Agent: Let me check... (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any same-day availability in your area right now. We're actually running pretty backed up today. I apologize for that.

Customer: That's frustrating. Can I at least pick one up today instead of waiting?

Agent: Let me see what I can do. (pause) (typing sounds) Actually, I'm pulling up the store locator here, and the nearest store is about fifteen miles away. Would that work for you?

Customer: I mean, I guess. Can you tell me where it is?

Agent: It's on Maple Street, in the shopping plaza near the grocery store. Store hours are 9 AM to 6 PM. When you go in, just let them know your account number and that you need a replacement modem due to a failure. They'll set you up with one.

Customer: And I can just plug it in when I get home and it'll work?

Agent: Yes, you should be able to. Once you plug it in and the lights come on, it should automatically connect to our network within a couple minutes. But if you run into any issues once you get it set up, feel free to give us back a call and we can walk through it.

Customer: Okay, I guess I'll try that. I'm not thrilled about having to go out, but... (sighs)

Agent: I hear you. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working remotely. Before you go, let me just document this on your account. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm noting here that we've done extensive troubleshooting, ruled out external factors, and determined the modem needs replacement. So when you pick up that new device, just reference your account number and that should speed things up. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... yeah, that's it. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Yeah, no problem. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day. Bye now.
