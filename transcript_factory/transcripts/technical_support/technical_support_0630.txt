Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet has been down since this morning and I've already tried unplugging the router and everything, and it's just not coming back on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll definitely get this sorted out for you. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking here... account for Michael Chen on Oakwood Drive, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned you unplugged the router already—that's a good first step. Let me ask you a few questions. When you say the internet is down, do you have any lights on your modem at all?

Customer: Um, let me go check. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. The power light is on, that's like, the green one, right? But the internet light, the one that usually blinks, that's not doing anything. It's just... off.

Agent: Alright, so the power is good, but you're not seeing any activity on the internet light. That's helpful. And you have the modem and router, correct?

Customer: Yeah, I have both. They're stacked on top of each other next to my TV.

Agent: Okay. Can you check the cable that connects from the wall outlet to the modem? Just make sure it's fully plugged in on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it. It seems pretty tight, but let me... (sound of movement) ...let me just unplug it and plug it back in to be sure.

Agent: Good idea.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged back in. Still nothing. The light's still not on.

Agent: Alright. And this just started this morning? There weren't any storms last night or anything that might have caused an outage?

Customer: No, not that I noticed. I mean, the weather's been fine. I was watching Netflix last night before bed and it was working perfectly. Woke up this morning and just... nothing.

Agent: Understood. Let me check our systems here to see if there's an outage in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages on Oakwood Drive at the moment. Let me try a couple more things. Can you unplug the modem completely—and I mean the power cable—and wait about 30 seconds before plugging it back in?

Customer: Sure, doing that now. (pause) Unplugged. I'm just gonna wait... (pause) ...okay, 30 seconds is up. Plugging it back in. (pause) Hmm, the power light came back on, so that's good, but still no internet light.

Agent: Okay. Sometimes these things take a minute or two to fully boot up. Let's give it about another 30 seconds or so and see if that internet light comes on.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm watching it... still nothing. Nope, it's been like a minute now and it's just... still off.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's not ideal. Let me ask—do you have a coax cable running from the wall to the modem?

Customer: A... what? The coax cable?

Agent: Yeah, it's a thick cable, usually white or black, and it has these metal connectors on the end. It screws into both the wall and the modem.

Customer: Oh! Yeah, yeah, I see that. Yeah, it's connected.

Agent: Can you check if that's tight as well? Sometimes these can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it feels tight to me. I mean, I'm not gonna like, break it or anything, but it doesn't seem to be loose.

Agent: (brief pause) Alright. What I'd like to do is escalate this a bit. Let me try restarting the modem from our end. This might take just a moment. (typing sounds) I'm sending a restart command to your modem now.

Customer: Okay. Should I expect to see something happen?

Agent: You might see the lights flicker or reset. Just watch and let me know if that internet light comes on.

Customer: (pause) Um... the lights flickered, yeah. Power light's back on... and... (pause) ...nope. Still nothing on the internet light. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I understand. I know how annoying this is. (pause) Okay, so at this point, I'm suspecting it might be an issue with the modem itself. We've done all the standard troubleshooting. Let me ask you—how long have you had this modem?

Customer: Uh, I don't know, maybe three years? It's the one you guys provided when I signed up.

Agent: Okay. And you haven't had any issues with it up until now?

Customer: No, it's worked great actually. I don't understand what would cause it to just stop working overnight.

Agent: It's hard to say. Sometimes these devices just fail. But before we go down that road, I want to try one more thing. Can you check if there are any other cables plugged into the modem? Like Ethernet cables, anything like that?

Customer: Let me look. (pause) No, nothing. Just the power and that coax thing you mentioned.

Agent: Alright. And when you look at the modem, are there any indicator lights at all that are red or orange, or is it just the power light?

Customer: (pause) Just the power light. Everything else is dark.

Agent: (long pause) Okay. So here's where we're at. Based on everything we've tried, it really does seem like the modem might be having a hardware issue. I don't want to waste any more of your time today with troubleshooting that likely won't work. What I'd like to do is schedule a technician visit for you. They can come out, check the modem, check all the connections, and get you back up and running. Would that work for you?

Customer: A technician? How long does that usually take to schedule?

Agent: Typically we can get someone out within the next 24 to 48 hours, depending on availability in your area. Let me check our schedule. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm seeing we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Which would be better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. I really need the internet back.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get you scheduled for tomorrow morning. That would be between 8 AM and 12 PM. The technician will come out and assess the situation. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I mean, I guess I'm just disappointed this is happening, but hopefully the tech can fix it.

Agent: I hear you. And I apologize for the inconvenience. Just to confirm everything: we have you scheduled for tomorrow, [inaudible] morning, 8 AM to 12 PM window. A technician will arrive at your address on Oakwood Drive. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that sounds good. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: You're welcome. And again, I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved today. But our tech should be able to help you out tomorrow. Thank you for calling Frontier, and have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
