Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I get the name on the account, please?

Customer: It's James. James Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, since like 7 AM or so. I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing was loading. At first I thought it was my router, but I've tried everything I can think of.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let's start with the basics here. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Are the lights on your modem and router?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) Yeah, the modem has lights on it. There's a green light and a... I think a yellow one? And the router's got lights too, but I'm not really sure what they're supposed to look like.

Agent: Okay, so the yellow light on the modem is actually what we want to focus on. That typically indicates a connection issue. Can you do me a favor and tell me—is there a light that's specifically labeled "Internet" or has maybe an arrow pointing to the internet?

Customer: (pause) Uh... let me... yeah, I think so? There's one that says "Online" and it's... it's not lit up. That's red or off or something.

Agent: That's helpful. That tells me the modem isn't connecting to our network. Let's try some basic troubleshooting. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Can you wait about thirty seconds for me?

Customer: (pause) Okay... yep, been about thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in and we'll let it reboot. This usually takes a couple of minutes for all the lights to stabilize.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) The lights are flashing right now. I see a blue light starting to... yeah, it's doing its thing.

Agent: Excellent. While that's booting up, let me ask you—have there been any recent storms in your area, or any work being done outside your home?

Customer: Storms? No, not that I'm aware of. Why, is that...?

Agent: It can sometimes affect the line. We just want to rule that out. (pause) Okay, how are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Uh, the green light is solid now, the yellow one is still there, but... the Online light still looks like it's off. Or red. I can't really tell in this lighting.

Agent: Hmm, let me just confirm something. When you look at the Online indicator—is it completely dark, or do you see any color at all?

Customer: It's... it looks dark to me. It's definitely not the bright green like the other one.

Agent: Okay. And you mentioned you also have a router. Are the lights on the router showing any activity?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, there's lights on it, but again, I'm not... I don't really know what I'm looking for. It's not like it's all lit up, you know?

Agent: That's alright. The fact that the Online light isn't showing a stable green tells me the modem itself may have lost the connection to our network. Let me try something else. Can you check the cable that goes from the wall outlet into your modem? Is it plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I can see it. It looks pretty secure to me. It's... it's definitely in there.

Agent: Try giving it a little gentle push, just to make sure it's seated all the way in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, pushing it in... (pause) Did that do anything? Should I...?

Agent: Give it another minute or so to see if the light changes.

Customer: (pause) No, it's still the same. The Online light is still off.

Agent: Alright, let me check your account on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm showing that your service is active and everything appears normal from our network side. Let me try a couple more things. Do you have any other cables near the modem or router that might be interfering?

Customer: Interfering? Like... I don't think so. My modem and router are sitting on a shelf in my living room. There's... I mean, there's a lamp nearby and my phone charger, but...

Agent: Those shouldn't be an issue. Okay, James, I want you to do a full reset of the modem. Are you comfortable doing that?

Customer: A reset? What does that involve?

Agent: There should be a small reset button on the back of the modem. You'll need something like a pen or paperclip to press it. You'll hold it in for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me find it. (pause) Yeah, I think I see it. It's a tiny little button... (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... ten seconds... (pause) Alright, let go.

Agent: Good. The modem's going to reboot again, so let's give it a full two minutes this time before we check it.

Customer: (long pause) Two minutes, yeah, I can wait. (pause) So, um, how long does this usually take to fix if it's something on your end?

Agent: That's a great question. If it turns out to be a network issue, it could be resolved pretty quickly. If it's something with the equipment or the line, it might require a technician to come out and take a look. But let's see where we're at first.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Well, it's been a couple minutes. The lights are still the same. That Online light is definitely not turning green.

Agent: Alright. Let me try one more thing before we look at other options. Can you check your bill or your welcome packet for the modem model? It should say "Model" something on the device itself.

Customer: Yeah, let me look... (pause) It says... uh... "Model MB8621"?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up. And can you tell me—when you look at the back of the modem, are there any indicator lights that are red or blinking red?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't see any red. Just... the green one is solid, the yellow's blinking, and the Online one is off or dark.

Agent: [inaudible] (pause) James, I hate to tell you this, but based on what we're seeing here, it seems like there might be an issue with the modem itself or possibly the line coming into your house. This is beyond what I can troubleshoot over the phone.

Customer: Oh no, really? So what does that mean?

Agent: What it means is that we're going to need to get a technician out to your location to diagnose the problem and get this fixed for you. They can check the line from the street to your house and test the equipment.

Customer: How long is that going to take? When can they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what availability we have. We typically can get someone out within the next 24 to 48 hours. Can you tell me your service address so I can check specific times?

Customer: Yeah, it's 447 Maple Street, Apartment 3B. But 24 to 48 hours? I really need my internet before then. I work from home and I have a meeting tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me see if we have any earlier slots... (typing sounds) (pause) We do have a same-day appointment available if you can do tomorrow between 1 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I can do that. I can make that work.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. The technician will be able to bring a replacement modem if needed, or diagnose the line issue. Is there anything else I can help you with right now?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. I just really hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I do too, James. We'll get this taken care of. Your appointment is confirmed for tomorrow, 1 to 4 PM. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. If you need to reschedule or have any questions before the technician arrives, feel free to give us a call back. Again, I apologize for the trouble.

Customer: Alright, thanks for your help anyway, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, James. We'll get you back online soon. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
