# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I can't get it back up. I've already tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account here under the name... is this David Martinez?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have there been any storms in your area or any recent power outages?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine yesterday and then when I woke up and tried to check my email, nothing. It's been out all day.

Agent: Alright. Well, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you look at your modem and router for me? The modem should have a box with lights on it, usually near your TV or wherever your internet comes in.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's... um, it's got some lights on it. There's a red light though.

Agent: Okay, a red light. That's useful. Can you tell me which light is red? Is it the power light, the internet light, or...?

Customer: (pause) I'm not really sure. There's like... a power light that's red, I think? And then there's some green lights below it.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is red. That actually tells me the modem might not be getting power properly. Let me ask you—is the power cable plugged in securely on both ends?

Customer: Yeah, I checked that. It's plugged into the wall and into the modem.

Agent: Alright. Can you try unplugging it from the power outlet for about thirty seconds? Just pull it completely out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) Waiting... (pause) Alright, thirty seconds should be up.

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (background noise of plugging in) Alright, it's in.

Agent: Great. Give it about a minute to boot back up. What lights do you see now?

Customer: (pause) Um... still red on the power light. That's weird.

Agent: Hmm, okay. The power light should turn green or white once it boots up. Can you check the power cable one more time? Maybe try a different outlet if there's one nearby?

Customer: Oh, good idea. Hold on... (pause - background noise of moving things) Okay, I'm plugging it into a different outlet now. (pause) It's... still red. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand. Let me ask you something else—is there a backup battery or battery backup unit that might be connected to your modem? Sometimes those have their own power lights.

Customer: A backup battery? I... I don't think so? I just have the modem and the router sitting next to each other.

Agent: Okay. Um, one more thing—can you check if there's maybe a surge protector in between the wall outlet and the modem?

Customer: (pause) Oh! Actually, yeah, there is. The surge protector's light is off. Is that... is that a problem?

Agent: That might be it! The surge protector might've been tripped. Try flipping the switch on the surge protector if there is one.

Customer: There's like a reset button. Should I press that?

Agent: Yes, perfect. Go ahead and press the reset button.

Customer: (pause - clicking sound) Okay, I pressed it. (pause) And... nothing happened. The outlet still doesn't seem to have power.

Agent: Hmm. Can you try plugging something else into that surge protector? Like a lamp or your phone charger just to see if it's getting any power?

Customer: (pause) Just tried my phone charger and... nope, nothing. The surge protector's dead.

Agent: Okay, I think we found your issue. The surge protector lost power, so your modem's been off all this time. Unfortunately, I can't remotely reset that, but if you can move your modem to a different outlet that doesn't go through a surge protector, that should fix it.

Customer: Okay, let me try that. (background noise - objects moving) (pause) Alright, I'm plugging directly into a wall outlet now. (pause) The power light is... still red.

Agent: Still red? That's... okay, that's unusual. (typing sounds) Let me think here for a second. Is the outlet you're using a working outlet? Can you verify that with another device?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I plugged my lamp in and it works fine.

Agent: Okay. And you're sure you're connecting the correct cable? The power cable going from the outlet to the modem, not the internet cable?

Customer: (pause - slight frustration in voice) Yes, I've got the right cable. I've been doing this for like five years.

Agent: (pause) I appreciate that. I'm just trying to cover all the bases here. Um... this is a little unusual. The modem should power on with a working outlet and power cable. How old is your modem? Do you know?

Customer: I don't know, honestly. A few years? It came with the equipment when you guys installed it.

Agent: Alright. Let me put you on a very brief hold while I check a few things on the system here. It'll just be a moment.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (hold music - approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: David? You still there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Okay, so I've been looking at your account and your service and everything looks good on our end. No outages in your area, no service issues. I think what we might be dealing with here is a hardware failure with your modem. Sometimes they just... stop working.

Customer: So you're saying my modem's broken?

Agent: It's looking that way, yeah. I know that's frustrating. The good news is that we can get you a replacement modem shipped out. Usually takes about five to seven business days.

Customer: (frustrated) Five to seven days? That's a week. I need my internet working before then. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what options we have. (typing sounds) Um, actually, I do see that we have a rush shipping option available. If we go with that, we can get the modem to you in two to three business days instead.

Customer: Is there a charge for that?

Agent: Let me check... (pause) The rush shipping would be an additional $15.99. But you could potentially be back online in two to three days instead of a full week.

Customer: (heavy sigh) Yeah, okay. I don't have a choice. Can you just do that?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to process that for you right now. (typing sounds - pause) Okay, I've submitted the order for the replacement modem with rush shipping. You should receive an email confirmation within the hour, and it'll have tracking information once it ships.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything else I can try in the meantime? Just... I don't know, anything?

Agent: Unfortunately, if it's a hardware failure, there's not much we can do on the troubleshooting side. But just to be thorough, you could try checking that power cable one more time, maybe try a completely different outlet in a different room if you haven't already?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess I could try that.

Agent: I know it's not ideal, but hopefully the rush shipping gets your modem here quickly and gets you back online soon. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... that's all. I guess I'll just wait for the modem to arrive then.

Agent: I'm really sorry you're dealing with this, David. I know how frustrating it is to be without internet. Your replacement modem should be with you by Thursday at the latest. If you don't receive it or have any other issues, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day, and thanks for choosing Frontier.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
