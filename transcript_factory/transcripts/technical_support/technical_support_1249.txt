# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I'm working from home today and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you troubleshoot that. Can I grab your account information really quick?

Customer: Yeah, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got your account here. I'm showing service at 2847 Maple Drive, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, you're saying you have no internet connection at all right now?

Customer: Right, yeah. Nothing. I tried restarting the modem, unplugging it, all that stuff. Still nothing. The lights on the front aren't even turning on.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting on your part. So the modem is completely dark—no lights at all?

Customer: Exactly. It's like... it's not getting power or something.

Agent: Alright, let me ask you a few things. Is the power cable connected to the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's plugged in. Let me just... (rustling sounds) ...actually, wait. It's plugged into the outlet but hold on... (pause) Oh, wow.

Agent: What's going on?

Customer: The outlet doesn't have power. Like, nothing's plugged in there that's working.

Agent: Okay, so it looks like you might have a power issue there. Do you have another outlet you could try? Maybe in a different room?

Customer: Yeah, let me go grab... (background noise, footsteps) Okay, I'm moving it to my bedroom. (pause) Plugging it in now. (pause) Okay... still nothing. The lights still aren't coming on.

Agent: Hmm, that's strange. Let me just pull up your account details here and see if there's anything on our end. (typing sounds) Have you had any storms recently in your area?

Customer: No, not that I can think of. It's been pretty clear all day.

Agent: Alright. So with the modem not powering on at all, it could be a couple of things. It might be the modem itself has failed, or there could be a service issue in your area. Let me check our system for any outages or service alerts. (pause, typing) I'm not seeing any active outages in your area, which is good news.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is the modem broken?

Agent: It could be. When's the last time you remember it working normally?

Customer: Like... yesterday? I was on a video call yesterday afternoon and everything was fine. I got up this morning, went to work, came home for lunch, and that's when I noticed it was down.

Agent: Okay. And you've tried two different outlets now, correct?

Customer: Yeah.

Agent: Alright, let me try something else. Can you check the power cable itself? Is it fully inserted into both the modem and the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause, rustling) Yeah, it looks like it's in there pretty tight. I mean, it's definitely connected.

Agent: Okay. And do you have a different power cable you could try? Maybe from another device?

Customer: I... probably? Let me look. (pause, background noise) Uh, I've got a laptop charger but that's not going to fit.

Agent: Right, no, that won't work. The thing is, without power to the modem, I can't really do a remote diagnostic. When the modem does turn on, there should be lights—usually green ones—on the front. Since we're getting nothing at all, it's pretty likely the modem itself is defective or the power supply is.

Customer: So what do I need to do?

Agent: (pause) So here's what I'd recommend. We can send a technician out to your place to take a look at the equipment and get you back online. Alternatively, if you want to try and get back up faster, you could pick up a modem from one of our retail locations. There's a Frontier store about fifteen minutes from you.

Customer: I really can't leave right now. I've got back-to-back meetings this afternoon. Can you send someone out?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) I'm showing we have availability... looks like we could get someone out there tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we also have a 4 to 6 PM window today.

Customer: You can do today? That's... actually, yeah, that would be amazing. I'll take the 4 to 6.

Agent: Perfect. (typing) I've got you down for today, 4 to 6 PM. The technician's name will be... (pause) ...Marcus. He'll be able to diagnose the issue and either repair it or swap out the equipment. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that's great. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Now, just to make sure we've tried everything before the tech comes out, is there anything else on your end that might indicate power? Like, are all the outlets in that area not working, or just the ones you tried?

Customer: (pause) That's a good question. Actually, let me check the rest of the room... (background noise, pause) No, other stuff is fine. The lamp over here works. It's just... I don't know, maybe those outlets were already bad or something.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Well, that could actually be an issue with your home's power, but the technician will take a look at that too when he gets there. And just to cover all our bases here, is there a power outlet right where your modem normally sits?

Customer: Yeah, the outlet is like right there where the modem box is. That's where it's supposed to be.

Agent: Can you test that outlet with something else? Like a phone charger or something small?

Customer: (pause, rustling) Oh. Oh wow. Yeah, so that outlet doesn't work either. So like... (pause) ...maybe my outlets are just out in that area?

Agent: That's actually pretty possible. Could be a circuit breaker issue in your house, or maybe the outlet itself went bad. Either way, the technician will help sort it out. But I do want to set your expectations—if it turns out to be a home electrical issue, that would be outside of what our service covers. They might recommend you call an electrician. But they'll definitely figure out what's going on.

Customer: Okay, well... I mean, I still don't have internet, so I guess we'll see what happens.

Agent: Right. I completely understand. Alright, so to recap: Marcus will be there between 4 and 6 PM today. You'll receive a confirmation text and email shortly. Do you have any other questions before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. I just hope he can fix it quick.

Agent: I'm sure we'll get you sorted out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Your confirmation details will be sent to you momentarily. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Thank you. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
