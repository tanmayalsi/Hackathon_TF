Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I've tried restarting everything but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I see your account here. So your service has been down since this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, around 8 or 9 AM. I went to check my email for work and just... nothing. No internet at all.

Agent: Okay, I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me ask you a few quick questions. When you say no internet, do you have any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, let me go look. (pause) Yeah, so the modem has a red light on it. That's not good, right?

Agent: Okay, actually that's helpful information. The red light usually means there's a connectivity issue. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Sure, doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Can you count to thirty for me and then plug it back in?

Customer: (counting softly in background) ...twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. Plugging it back in now.

Agent: (pause) And we'll give that just a moment to boot back up. Sometimes that can resolve connectivity issues pretty quickly.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Hmm, still red.

Agent: Still red? Okay, that's... let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your account and I'm not seeing any service disruptions in your area reported right now. Did you happen to check if there were any cables that might have come loose? Sometimes they can get disconnected if there was recent weather or anything like that.

Customer: No, it's been pretty quiet weather-wise. But, uh, let me go check behind everything. (pause) I'm looking at the back of the modem now. The cables all look pretty secure to me.

Agent: Alright, I appreciate you checking that. Can you do me a favor and also restart your router separately? If you have a router that's different from your modem.

Customer: Yeah, I've got a separate router. Okay, unplugging that now too.

Agent: Perfect.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back on. (pause) Nope, modem still has the red light.

Agent: Alright, David, let me try something different here. I'm going to send a signal to your modem to see if there's something going on with our end. Can you just keep an eye on those lights for me for about a minute?

Customer: Sure, I'm watching it. (pause) Still red.

Agent: (typing sounds) I've sent a reset signal. Any change?

Customer: (pause) No, still the same red light.

Agent: Okay, so what I'm seeing on my end is that your modem is connecting to our network, but it's not completing the handshake properly. That's causing that red light. When you look at the back of your modem, do you see the cable that comes from the wall? The one that connects to your service line?

Customer: Oh, um, yeah. Let me see... (pause) Yeah, I can see it. It looks plugged in.

Agent: Can you try unplugging that one and plugging it back in? Sometimes the connection point can get a little loose.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Alright, I've unplugged it from the modem. Now plugging it back in. (pause) Hmm... nope, still red.

Agent: (sigh) Alright, I appreciate your patience with me here. Let me try one more thing. I'm going to see if I can remotely restart the modem from our system. This might take about thirty seconds.

Customer: Sure, go ahead.

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) Okay, the system's processing that. You should see the lights go out and then come back on.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see the lights going off... and they're coming back on. (pause) Okay, and... still red. This is... this is really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand, David. I'm frustrated for you too, honestly. (pause) What I'm thinking at this point is that we might have a hardware issue with your modem, or there could be a line issue that we're not able to diagnose remotely. The fact that we can see the device trying to connect but not completing the connection suggests it's either the modem itself or something with the line coming into your house.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long before I can get my internet back?

Agent: Well, here's what I'd like to do. I want to get a technician out to your location to take a look at things in person. They can check the line, test the modem, and see if there's something physical going on that we're missing. Typically we can schedule something within the next 24 to 48 hours.

Customer: Within 24 to 48 hours? I need internet for work. I'm supposed to be in a call with my team in like... (pause) ...in two hours.

Agent: I hear you, and I'm sorry we can't get this resolved faster. Unfortunately, given that we can't get it working remotely, the technician visit is really the best option. Let me check what appointments we have available today.

Customer: Okay, yeah, please do.

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) So looking at today, our next available window in your area is actually... 5 to 7 PM this evening. Would that work for you?

Customer: Five to seven? I guess so. Is there anything earlier? Like afternoon?

Agent: (typing sounds) Unfortunately, the afternoon slots are completely booked for today. The 5 to 7 PM window is the earliest I can get someone out there.

Customer: Alright, fine. Let's do 5 to 7. I'll make it work.

Agent: Excellent. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, we have you booked for a technician visit today between 5 and 7 PM. You should receive a confirmation text and email at the addresses we have on file. Is there a mobile number we should use to contact the technician?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0156.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I've got that down. David, is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: Um, no, I guess not. I just... I hope they can actually fix it this time.

Agent: I completely understand. The technician will do a full diagnostic. If it is the modem, we can potentially provide you with a replacement device today. I don't want to promise anything, but that's a possibility.

Customer: Okay. Well, I guess I'll see what happens at 5.

Agent: Alright, thank you for your patience today, David. I know this has been frustrating. We really do appreciate you being a Frontier customer, and hopefully we'll have you back online this evening.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: You take care. Goodbye.
