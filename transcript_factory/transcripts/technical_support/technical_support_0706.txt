Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out this morning and I can't get it back online. I've been without it for like two hours now.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing your account under... Michael Torres, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. So you're experiencing a complete outage—no internet connection at all, correct?

Customer: Right. Like, I tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in, and nothing. No lights, nothing. Well, actually, there are some lights, but I'm not really sure what they mean.

Agent: Okay, that's good that you tried that already. Let me walk you through a few things. First, I want to check on the modem—not the router, the modem. That's the box that comes directly from us. Can you look at that right now?

Customer: Um, yeah, I'm looking at it now. It's... it's the white box, right? Under the TV?

Agent: That's probably it. So on that white box, there should be some lights on the front. Can you tell me what you're seeing? Are there any lights lit up at all?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, so there's a... there's like a red light that's steady, and then I think I see maybe a green light that's blinking?

Agent: Okay, so a red light that's solid and a green light that's blinking. That's actually... hmm, that's a little unusual. The red light usually indicates an error. Can you do me a favor and check the back of the modem? Is there a power cable plugged in?

Customer: Uh, yeah, it's definitely plugged in. I can see it from here.

Agent: Good. And are there any cables going into the back besides the power cable? Like, is there a cable coming from the wall into the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's like a... a coaxial cable? I think that's what it's called. My installer told me about it.

Agent: Perfect, that's the one. Can you just double-check that it's nice and snug? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm... I'm jiggling it a little bit and... no, it seems pretty tight to me.

Agent: Alright. And you said there's a red light on there?

Customer: Yeah, the red light's still there.

Agent: Okay, Michael, I'm going to try to reset your modem remotely here. This should take just a moment. (typing sounds) I'm sending that signal now. Can you watch the lights on your modem and let me know if anything changes?

Customer: (pause) Um... okay, they're... they're doing something. The green light is doing more... it's blinking faster maybe? And the red light is still there.

Agent: Still red?

Customer: Yeah.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let me try something else. I want you to manually restart the modem. Can you locate the power button on the back or the side of that modem?

Customer: The power button? I... I don't think there is one.

Agent: Alright, no worries. In that case, what we're going to do is unplug the power cable, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. Go ahead and do that for me.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) It's unplugged. How long do I wait?

Agent: Just count to thirty. Or, you know, roughly thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... alright, I'm plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Now let's watch those lights again. What are you seeing?

Customer: (pause) Uh... the lights are off right now. Now there's like... oh, now I see a light turn on. It's amber or yellow maybe? And it's blinking.

Agent: Okay, that's actually normal. When the modem first boots up, it goes through a startup sequence. That amber light should turn green once it's finished initializing. This can take anywhere from a minute to a couple minutes. Can you hold tight for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (long pause) Um, it's still amber. Is that... is that bad?

Agent: Not necessarily. Like I said, it can take a couple minutes. Let's give it a little more time. Why don't we chat while we wait? Have you had any recent weather in your area? Power outages, anything like that?

Customer: No, not that I know of. It was just working fine last night, and then I went to use it this morning and it was just dead.

Agent: Right. Well, we have been doing some maintenance on the lines in your area over the last couple of days, so it's possible that's related. Let me check the status here. (typing sounds) I'm pulling up the network diagnostics for your location... (pause) Interesting.

Customer: What? Is something wrong?

Agent: Well, I'm actually showing that we are detecting a signal coming from your location, so the modem is connecting to our network, which is good. But I'm not seeing a strong signal coming back. It's almost like the modem is trying to reach us but something's getting in the way.

Customer: Oh no. So what does that mean?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be an issue with the line itself, or it could be that the modem just needs a little more time to sync up. How are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Still amber.

Agent: Still amber. Okay, at this point, I think we might be looking at a line issue. But before I escalate this, let me ask you—do you have a backup device you could test with? Like a tablet or phone with WiFi capability?

Customer: Oh, um, yeah, I have my phone. Do you want me to look for our WiFi network?

Agent: Exactly. Go ahead and see if you can see your Frontier network in the available networks.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking... I don't see it. I don't see any WiFi network at all.

Agent: You don't see your network or any network?

Customer: No, I mean... there's no networks showing up.

Agent: Okay, that makes sense. If the modem isn't fully synced, it wouldn't be broadcasting the WiFi signal. Um... (pause) Michael, I think what we're dealing with here is an issue on our end. The modem is trying to connect but it's not able to fully establish that connection. I wish I had better news, but at this point, I think we need to get a technician out to your location to physically check the line and the equipment.

Customer: A technician? Like... how long would that take?

Agent: Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds) So... it looks like I can get someone out to you... (pause) ...earliest would be tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM. I know that's a bit of a window, but is that something that would work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Is there anything sooner? Like... today?

Agent: (pause) I'm checking now... unfortunately, our service area for today is fully booked. Tomorrow is really the soonest I can get someone out. I do apologize for that.

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, okay. I guess that's fine. Tomorrow morning would be better if possible.

Agent: Let me see... I can flag this as a priority morning appointment. How does between 8 and 10 AM sound?

Customer: Yeah, that's good.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. The technician's name will be provided in a confirmation text and email that you'll receive shortly. They'll have your contact information, so they may call ahead. Is the number we have on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Excellent. And Michael, just to make sure we have your address correct for the technician... (typing sounds) I'm showing 447 Maple Drive, Unit 12?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So to recap, we have a service call scheduled for tomorrow morning between 8 and 10 AM to diagnose and hopefully resolve the internet connectivity issue. In the meantime, there's unfortunately not much we can do remotely, but you should see that confirmation come through within the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay. And... is there anything I should try in the meantime? Like, should I keep the modem unplugged or what?

Agent: Actually, I'd recommend leaving it plugged in and powered on. It's possible that overnight it might finish syncing on its own, though I'm not going to give you false hope—I think the technician will need to come out. But there's no harm in leaving it running. 

Customer: Alright. Well, thanks for your help, even if we couldn't get it working.

Agent: I really do apologize that we couldn't resolve this over the phone. I know it's inconvenient. But our technician should be able to get you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, Michael, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
