# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just... it went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried everything I can think of and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Uh, yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now... and I've got you here. Just to confirm, this is for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage, correct? Is your modem powered on right now?

Customer: Yes, it's on. The lights are blinking and everything. Well, most of the lights are blinking. The internet light is definitely not on though. That's kind of the problem, I think.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. Okay, so we're going to go through some troubleshooting steps. First, can you locate your modem and tell me what model it is? It should be printed on the front or back.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, hold on... it's a, uh... the Frontier 7622. I think that's what it says.

Agent: Great, the 7622. That's one of our standard models. Alright, here's what I need you to do. I'm going to have you do a hard reset on the modem. Can you unplug it from the power source?

Customer: Right now?

Agent: Yes, please.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now I need you to wait for about thirty seconds while it powers down completely.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm just... standing here waiting.

Agent: (chuckles) I know, it's not the most exciting part. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in device) Okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Great. Now we're going to wait about two to three minutes for it to fully boot back up. While it's doing that, let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me... have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, no outages that I know of. The internet's been fine all day and then just suddenly it cut out.

Agent: Okay, and did anything unusual happen right before it went down? Like a power surge, or a storm, or...?

Customer: Uh, not that I noticed. It was pretty normal. I was just working from home and then boom, nothing. No warning or anything.

Agent: I'm seeing a few power events on your line, actually. Nothing major, but there's definitely been some activity. (pause) Alright, how's that modem looking now? Any lights coming back on?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, so... the power light is on, the online light is... starting to blink. And... no, the internet light's still not on. But at least we're getting somewhere, right?

Agent: That's a good sign that it's responding. Sometimes it takes a minute. Let's give it another thirty seconds or so.

Customer: Sure, yeah, I can see it's... okay, the online light is solid now.

Agent: Excellent. That's what we want to see. How about the internet light?

Customer: (pause) Nope. Still nothing. That's... that's not good, is it?

Agent: Well, it could still be booting. Sometimes it takes a little longer. Let me try a different approach. Let's check your cables. Can you follow the cables coming out of your modem and make sure they're all plugged in securely?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, okay... I'm looking at it. There's the power cable, which is definitely in. There's one going to... I guess that's the router? And then there's one more that goes into the wall.

Agent: Alright, can you make sure all of those are firmly connected? Sometimes they can work their way loose.

Customer: (sounds of things being adjusted) Yeah, I'm... I'm pushing them all in. They seem pretty secure actually. I don't think that's the issue.

Agent: Okay, no problem. How's the internet light looking now?

Customer: (pause) No change. Still off.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, let me check the signal levels we're getting from your modem on this end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm seeing some concerning numbers here, to be honest with you. The downstream power is a bit high, which could indicate a line issue.

Customer: What does that mean? Like, is it something I can fix?

Agent: Unfortunately, probably not on your end. It looks like there might be an issue with the line coming into your house, or possibly at our network level. Let me... (typing sounds) Let me run a line test real quick. This is going to take about a minute.

Customer: Okay, no problem.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) (pause) Yeah, so the line test is showing instability. We're getting intermittent signal drops, which would definitely explain why your internet light isn't coming on.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you guys fix it?

Agent: Well, that's where we might need to schedule a technician visit. But before we jump to that, let me try one more thing. Is there anything plugged into the modem besides the router? Any phone lines or... anything else?

Customer: Uh, no, I don't think so. Just the one cable going to the router.

Agent: Okay. Let me try resetting the modem to factory settings. This is going to take about five minutes and it'll clear everything, but sometimes it helps with these kinds of issues. Are you comfortable with that?

Customer: Yeah, sure, go ahead.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm initiating the reset now. It's going to take a couple of minutes. Can you just stay on the line with me?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: (pause) So how long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Uh, about three years now? We switched over from our old provider.

Agent: Great, well we appreciate your business. (pause) Alright, the reset should be processing. Give it another minute or so.

Customer: (pause) Okay... so the lights are all... going crazy right now. They're all blinking.

Agent: That's normal during the reset. That's actually a good sign.

Customer: (pause) Wait, now they're all off.

Agent: That's fine. It's rebooting. Give it about thirty more seconds.

Customer: (long pause) The power light's back on. Online light is blinking... blinking... (pause) ...and now it's solid again. But I don't see the internet light.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Hmm. Let me check my end again. (pause) (typing sounds) (pause) Still showing those same line instability issues. I'm not seeing an improvement from the reset.

Customer: So it's not working, then. The internet's not working.

Agent: Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be. I'm really sorry about this. At this point, I think we're going to need to get a technician out to your location to check the line. There appears to be a signal integrity issue that's preventing the connection from establishing properly.

Customer: Alright, so how long does that usually take? When can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could schedule something for Thursday afternoon. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. I really need to get this fixed because I work from home and I've already lost a whole hour.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get you scheduled. (typing sounds) Alright, I've got you down for tomorrow, 8 to 12 PM. Is there anything else you need from me today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I just... I hope the technician can actually fix it.

Agent: They should be able to. If it's a line issue, they'll get to the root of it. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks for trying, anyway.

Agent: You're welcome, and again I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get you back online as soon as possible. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a great day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
