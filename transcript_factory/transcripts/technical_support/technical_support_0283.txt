Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm having trouble with my internet. It's completely down right now and I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's area code 555, 234-8901.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here... and I've got your account. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. When did you first notice the internet went out?

Customer: Um, maybe about an hour ago? I was just working on my laptop and then suddenly no connection. I tried restarting the router and everything still shows nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's good that you already tried that. Let me check a couple things on my end. Can you tell me what color the lights are on your ONT unit right now? That's the small white or gray box, usually mounted on the side of your house or in a closet.

Customer: Okay, hold on... (pause) Yeah, I found it. Um, the lights are... there's a red light on the top and then the other lights are off. Is that bad?

Agent: A red light typically indicates there's an issue with the connection. That's actually helpful information. Let me see if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) No, I'm not showing any outages. Let me have you try something for me. Can you unplug the ONT unit for about 30 seconds and then plug it back in?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. I'm gonna wait... (pause) Okay, thirty seconds is up. Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. While that's booting back up, are you in a single-family home, or do you have an apartment setup?

Customer: It's a house. Single family.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so while we're waiting for that to come back online, let me also ask—do you have any external splitters on your line? Sometimes those can cause issues.

Customer: I... I'm not entirely sure what that is, honestly.

Agent: No problem. Those would be small devices on the cables, usually near where the line comes into your house. Nothing to worry about right now. How are those lights looking?

Customer: (pause) Um, still the same. Red light on top, everything else is dark.

Agent: Okay, that's... that's not ideal. The red light should have cleared by now. Let me try something else. I'm going to send a reset command to your ONT from here. That might take a couple minutes to process. Can you give me just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, of course.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, the reset has been sent. This should take about two to three minutes. Why don't you stay on the line with me?

Customer: Okay, I'm here.

(long pause)

Agent: So while we wait, have there been any recent storms in your area, or any construction work near your property?

Customer: Um, no, not that I know of. We had some rain yesterday, but nothing major.

Agent: Okay, just checking. Sometimes weather or line work can affect things. Let me see... (typing sounds) It's been about three minutes now. Can you check those lights again for me?

Customer: (pause) Nope, still the same. Red on top, rest is dark.

Agent: Hmm, that's frustrating. Okay, let me try one more thing here. I'm going to have you do a power cycle on the ONT again, but this time I want you to also unplug your router if you have one.

Customer: I have a Frontier router, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. So go ahead and unplug both the ONT and the router, and let's leave them unplugged for about sixty seconds this time.

Customer: Alright. (pause) Both are unplugged now. (pause) Okay, sixty seconds... (pause) Alright, plugging the ONT back in first.

Agent: Good.

Customer: (pause) Now the router. Okay, both are back on.

Agent: Great. Let's give those a minute to fully boot up this time. (pause) Okay, checking the ONT lights again—what are we seeing?

Customer: (pause) Still red on top. Still nothing else.

Agent: (pause) I see. Alright, I'm showing that red light persists even after the reset, which typically indicates there's either a line issue on our end or potentially a hardware malfunction with the ONT unit itself. Unfortunately, at this point, I think we need to escalate this.

Customer: What does that mean? Like, what's going on?

Agent: So the red light usually indicates a problem with the connection between our network and your ONT unit. I've tried the standard troubleshooting steps, and it's not clearing up. This could mean there's an issue with the fiber line coming to your house, or it could be that the ONT device itself is failing.

Customer: Okay... so what do I do?

Agent: The best next step would be to schedule a technician visit. They can come out and do a full diagnostic, check the fiber line, and if needed, replace the ONT unit for you.

Customer: How long would that take? I need my internet up as soon as possible.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm showing we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have another slot on Thursday afternoon. What works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be great. Can you do like 9 or 10?

Agent: Tomorrow morning... (typing sounds) Yes, I can schedule you for tomorrow between 9 and 10 AM. The technician will call you thirty minutes before they arrive, and the visit should take about 30 to 45 minutes.

Customer: Alright, I'll take it. And you don't think this is something I can fix myself?

Agent: Unfortunately, with the persistent red light and the fact that the remote resets didn't clear it, this is almost certainly something on our end or with the equipment. A technician will be able to pinpoint exactly what's happening and get you back online.

Customer: Okay, I guess that's the best option then.

Agent: I've scheduled technician ID 4782 for tomorrow, June 14th, between 9 and 10 AM. Is the phone number I have on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that should work.

Agent: Perfect. You'll get a confirmation text and email shortly with all the details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident they'll get to the bottom of it. Thanks for being such a great customer, and I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this remotely today. Have a good one.

Customer: Yeah, thanks for trying. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye!
