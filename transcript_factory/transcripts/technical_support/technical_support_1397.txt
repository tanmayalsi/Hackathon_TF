Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. So your service went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Uh, I'd say around 8 or 8:30. I tried restarting the router, unplugging it and all that, but nothing's worked.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on restarting it. That actually resolves most issues. Let me ask you a few questions. When you look at your router right now, what lights do you see? Are any of them lit up?

Customer: Yeah, um... (pause) the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light—I think that's the one that shows connection—that one's off. It's not lit up at all.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on but no internet light. That tells me the router isn't detecting a signal from our network. Let me check if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) What's your street address?

Customer: It's 2847 Maple Drive, apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, let me see here... I'm not showing any reported outages in your area, so that's... that's a good sign actually. Let's try a couple of things. First, I want you to check the cable that goes from the wall to your modem. Can you do that for me?

Customer: The cable from the wall? Um, yeah, I can look. (background noise of movement) Okay, I'm looking at it now. It seems like it's... I mean, it looks plugged in pretty tight.

Agent: Okay, and the cable itself—does it look like it's in good condition? Any kinks, pinches, anything like that?

Customer: No, it looks fine to me. Looks normal.

Agent: Alright. Let's try unplugging it from the wall outlet for about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. This'll do a full reset of your modem.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Thirty seconds, you said? (pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about two to three minutes to fully boot back up and establish connection. While we wait, let me ask—have you had any recent storms or anything like that in your area?

Customer: Not that I know of. It's been pretty clear today.

Agent: Okay, good. (pause) Let's give it another minute. Sometimes these things take a little bit. (pause) Alright, do you see any changes on the modem now? Is that internet light coming on?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. The power light's still green but that internet light is still dark.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try something else. Can you tell me—do you have a separate modem and router, or is it a combo unit?

Customer: I think it's... I'm not really sure, to be honest. It's just the one box that Frontier installed when I set up service.

Agent: That's a combo unit, that's what we typically install. Okay, and how long have you had service with us?

Customer: About two years now, I think.

Agent: Okay, so this is the first time you're having an issue like this?

Customer: Yeah, first time. It's always worked pretty well until today.

Agent: Alright, well I appreciate that. Let me try a few more things. I'm going to send a test signal to your modem from here. (typing sounds) This might take just a moment... (pause) Okay, I'm... I'm not getting a response back. That tells me the modem might not be communicating with our network properly. Let me have you try a factory reset. Are you comfortable doing that?

Customer: A factory reset? What does that do exactly?

Agent: It basically clears all the settings on the modem and returns it to its original state. The good news is, it should automatically reconnect to our network after it resets. Now, fair warning—this process takes about five to ten minutes total.

Customer: Yeah, okay, I can do that. How do I do it?

Agent: There should be a small button on the back of the modem. It's usually recessed so you need something small like a paperclip. You're going to hold that button down for about ten seconds. The modem will restart and all the lights should cycle through as it boots back up.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I see the button. I'm getting a paperclip. (pause) Okay, pushing it now. (pause) Oh wow, all the lights just went out.

Agent: That's perfect, that's exactly what should happen. Now just let it sit and boot back up. It should take about five to ten minutes. Why don't we stay on the line together while we wait?

Customer: Sure, yeah. I really need this working today, so... (pause) This is crazy. I've never had issues before.

Agent: I understand. We'll get you back up and running. (pause) So, out of curiosity, is your work something you do from home?

Customer: Yeah, I do some freelance consulting. I've got a meeting with a client this afternoon and I needed to do some prep work, so...

Agent: Yeah, I get it. Okay, let's see... should be about halfway through now. (pause) [inaudible] —any of the lights coming back?

Customer: Um, (pause) yeah, I'm starting to see... the power light's back on. It's green again.

Agent: Great, good. That's the first step. Now let's watch for that internet light. It should come on in the next minute or two.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, I'm watching... (pause) Nothing yet. Still just the power light.

Agent: (pause) Okay, give it one more minute. Sometimes this can take a bit longer depending on the network conditions. (pause) How's that looking now?

Customer: (pause) No... no, still just the power light. This doesn't look good.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, um... (typing sounds) Okay, let me check on my end again. (pause, typing) I'm still not detecting your modem on the network. That's... that's unusual.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be the modem itself, or it could be something with the line coming into your apartment. Unfortunately, at this point, I think we're going to need to get a technician out there to do an in-person diagnosis. I can't quite troubleshoot this remotely.

Customer: Okay, so... how long would that take? Can you get someone out today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability for you. (pause, typing) Okay, I'm looking at our schedule. We have some availability, but the earliest I can get someone out is tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need this today. This is... this is frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry. Today's schedule is pretty full, but if you'd like, I can note your account as urgent and see if a technician might be able to squeeze you in late today. But I can't guarantee anything. Tomorrow is what I can definitely schedule you for.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Let me do tomorrow. Can you do morning instead of afternoon?

Agent: Let me check... (typing sounds) Unfortunately, morning is completely booked. The 1 to 5 PM window tomorrow is what I have available.

Customer: Alright, fine. Book it for tomorrow.

Agent: Perfect. I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. In the meantime, just leave everything as is—don't try any more resets or anything like that. Okay?

Customer: Yeah, okay. I won't touch it. Is there anything I should tell the technician when they get there?

Agent: Just let them know what you've already tried—the restart, the factory reset, and that the modem isn't connecting to the network. I'll make sure all of that is noted in your ticket as well. We'll also send you a confirmation email with the appointment details.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. Uh, what's my ticket number or anything?

Agent: (typing sounds) Your ticket number is 4857391. That'll be in your email too.

Customer: Alright, 4857391. Got it.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sure they will. I apologize for the inconvenience, and thank you for being patient with us while we troubleshot this. You should see that email within the next few minutes.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
