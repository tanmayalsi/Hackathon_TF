Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out sometime this morning and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging everything, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my cell phone actually. The account should be under Robert Chen.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Robert, I've got you here. I see your service address is on Maple Street in Springfield. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went out this morning. Have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time in... I don't know, maybe six months? I've had pretty good service up until now. But this morning I woke up and the router just had no lights on it. Like, nothing.

Agent: Okay, okay. So the router isn't powering on at all. Let me ask you a few questions. First, can you check if the modem—that's the device that usually connects directly to the wall outlet—if that one has any lights on it?

Customer: (pause) Hold on, let me go look. I've got the router sitting on top of my cable box, so... okay, yeah, I'm looking at it now. No, the modem doesn't have any lights either. They're both completely dark.

Agent: Alright. That actually suggests it might be a power issue. Let me walk you through this. Can you check the power cable that goes into your modem? Sometimes these can come loose.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, I'm checking... it looks pretty plugged in to me. It goes into the wall and... yeah, it's definitely in there.

Agent: Good. And what about the power outlet itself? Do you have anything else plugged into that same outlet?

Customer: (pause) Actually, yeah. I have my router and my lamp on a power strip, and the power strip is plugged into the wall. Let me check if the power strip is even on... (clicking sounds) Huh, interesting. The power strip lights are off. Let me try turning it back on.

Agent: Great idea, Robert. Go ahead.

Customer: (clicking) Okay, I'm turning it on now and... (pause) ...still nothing. The modem and router still don't have any lights.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try something else. Can you unplug the modem and the router from the power strip entirely?

Customer: Sure. (unplugging sounds) Yeah, they're both unplugged.

Agent: Now wait about thirty seconds, and then plug the modem back in first. Give that one about a minute to boot up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. Waiting... (long pause) Alright, I'm plugging the modem back in now. (pause) And... (pause) ...nothing. There's still no lights coming on at all.

Agent: (pause) No lights at all? Not even a power indicator?

Customer: Nope. Completely dead.

Agent: I see. That's unusual. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Robert, I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, but let me check if we're detecting any connection issues from our side... (pause) I'm not seeing any alerts on the line, which is good news and bad news. Good news is your line seems to be active on our end. Bad news is we're not getting any signal from your modem.

Customer: So... what does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It might be a power supply issue with the modem itself, or there could be an issue with the device. But before we go down that road, let me ask—when you plug the modem into the power strip, can you try plugging it directly into the wall outlet instead? Just to rule out the power strip?

Customer: Oh, good idea. (pause) Let me move it... (unplugging and plugging sounds) Okay, I'm unplugging it from the power strip and... (pause) ...plugging it into the wall. (pause) Hmm. Still nothing.

Agent: Still no power indicator?

Customer: No, still nothing. It's like it's not getting any power at all.

Agent: (pause) Alright, can you try a different wall outlet? Sometimes outlets can stop working.

Customer: (pause) Um, sure. Let me try the outlet in the other room. (footsteps) Okay, I'm moving it to... this is the outlet in my bedroom. (unplugging and plugging sounds) (pause) Nope. Still nothing. This is really strange.

Agent: Yeah, that is strange. I have to be honest with you, Robert, this is pointing toward either an issue with the modem's power supply or the modem itself being faulty. When was the last time your modem was working? Do you remember?

Customer: Yeah, I used it last night. Everything was fine. I was streaming Netflix, no issues at all.

Agent: And this morning when you woke up it was just... off?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I didn't do anything to it. I went to bed, everything was working, and then I came downstairs this morning and it was dead.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let me put you on a brief hold while I see what options we have for you. This should only take a minute.

Customer: Okay.

(hold music plays)

Agent: Thank you for holding, Robert. I've looked into your options here. Given that the modem isn't showing any signs of power, I believe we're looking at a hardware failure. We can definitely send a replacement modem out to you, but that typically takes three to five business days to arrive.

Customer: Three to five days? I don't have internet until then?

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. Let me check if we have any expedited shipping options... (typing sounds) Unfortunately, standard shipping is what we have available right now. However, if you need internet access sooner, I can help you locate a Frontier store near you where you might be able to pick up a modem today.

Customer: Let me think about that. Is there any chance this is actually something on your end? Like, is there any way the modem could have been shut down remotely or something?

Agent: That's a good question. I don't have the ability to remotely power down a modem, and I'm not seeing any action from our side that would cause this. Plus, the fact that you're getting no power indicator at all—not even a dim light—really does suggest it's a power delivery issue with the device itself.

Customer: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. This is just... really inconvenient timing. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Given that you work from home, let me check one more time on whether we can expedite anything for you. (typing sounds) (pause) Robert, what I can do is I can flag your account for priority processing on the replacement modem, and I'll add a note that you work from home. It doesn't guarantee it'll arrive sooner, but it does move you up in the queue. The best I can promise is that you should have it within two to three business days instead of five.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I guess that's better than nothing. Yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Great. I'm going to process that replacement modem for you right now. You should expect it to arrive between Wednesday and Thursday of next week. You'll receive a tracking number via email and text.

Customer: Next week though? That's... okay. And in the meantime, there's really nothing else we can try?

Agent: (pause) I mean, we could try one more thing. Let me have you check the back of your modem where the power cable connects. Sometimes there can be a small reset button. Do you see one?

Customer: (pause) The back of the modem, you said? (sounds of movement) Okay, I'm looking at the back... (pause) Yeah, there's a small button here. It says "Reset" on it.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and press and hold that button for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it down... (long pause) ...ten seconds. Releasing it now. (pause) Nothing. Still no lights.

Agent: Yeah, I was hoping, but... I think we've exhausted what we can do on the troubleshooting end. The modem really does appear to be non-functional.

Customer: (sigh) Alright. So I'm all set with the replacement then?

Agent: Yes, you are. I have your replacement modem in the system for priority shipping. You should see it within two to three business days. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Robert?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry we weren't able to get you back up and running today. I know this is frustrating. When your new modem arrives, if you have any issues setting it up, feel free to give us a call back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Yeah, will do. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Robert. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
