Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I have to work from home today and I can't do anything without it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's, uh, 555-0147. That's my phone number on file.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And can I get a name please?

Customer: It's James... James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account here. I can see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Scottsdale area. So your internet just went down this morning?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around eight o'clock. I got home and tried to log in for work and nothing. The modem's still on, like, it's got lights and everything, but I'm not getting any connection.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you seeing any red lights on the modem, or are they all normal?

Customer: Uh... (pause) let me look at it. There's a... there's a red light on it. Yeah, there's definitely a red light.

Agent: Okay, do you know which light that is? Is it the power, the internet light, or...?

Customer: I'm not sure. I'm looking at it now. There's like four or five lights on here. One of them is red. I think it might be... the one that says "internet" or something? It's hard to tell.

Agent: No problem. Let me walk you through this. The light on the far left should be the power light—that one should be solid green or blue. Can you tell me what that one looks like?

Customer: Okay, um, yeah, that one's blue. That one's on.

Agent: Great. And next to that, you should see one that says "internet" or has like a globe symbol. What color is that one?

Customer: That's the red one. That's definitely red.

Agent: Okay, so that red internet light—is it blinking or is it solid?

Customer: It's... it's blinking. It's blinking red.

Agent: Alright, James. A blinking red light typically means the modem isn't able to sync with our network. Let's try a few things. First, I'm going to ask you to do a hard restart of your modem. Can you unplug it for me?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. And I want you to wait about thirty seconds before you plug it back in. While we wait, let me just check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your account and it shows the last time your modem connected to us was around 7:45 this morning.

Customer: So it just... stopped working?

Agent: That's what it's looking like. Okay, go ahead and plug that back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. The lights are coming back on. (pause) Same thing though. Red light is blinking again.

Agent: Okay, give it about a minute. Sometimes it takes a moment to re-sync. Just keep watching it for me.

Customer: (pause) Still red. It's not changing.

Agent: Alright. So it's not coming back up. Let me check a few other things. Are there any cables connected to the modem that might have come loose?

Customer: Let me look... (pause) No, everything looks pretty secure to me.

Agent: Okay. And just to confirm—you're not in an area where there was any construction or weather or anything unusual this morning?

Customer: No, it's been quiet. Nice day actually. [inaudible in background] Sorry, my neighbor's lawnmower. But no, nothing unusual here.

Agent: No worries. Um, okay, let me try one more thing. I'm going to have you do a factory reset on the modem. This will clear it completely and hopefully reconnect to our network.

Customer: How do I do that?

Agent: There should be a small reset button on the back or the bottom of the modem. It might be recessed in a little hole. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. I see a little hole with a button inside.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to need you to hold that down for about ten seconds. You might need a paperclip or a pen to reach it.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause) Got a pen. (pause) Pushing it in... (pause) Holding it down... (pause) Okay, I held it for like ten seconds. The lights went off.

Agent: Good. Now let it sit for about a minute while it reboots completely.

Customer: (pause - longer pause) Okay. The lights are coming back on. (pause) The power light's back. And... (pause) ...the internet light is still red.

Agent: Still blinking?

Customer: Yeah. Still blinking red.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Let me look at something here. (typing sounds) Hmm. I'm not seeing your modem reconnecting to the network on my end, which is unusual. Let me check if there's anything on our side that might be causing this. 

(pause)

Agent: James, I'm not showing any service issues in your area currently, and I'm not seeing any outages on our network. Have you had any issues with your modem in the past?

Customer: No, it's been fine. I've had it for... I don't know, maybe two years? No problems.

Agent: Okay, that's good. You know what, I think we might be dealing with a hardware issue with the modem itself. The fact that we're not seeing it connect after the reset is a pretty strong indicator of that.

Customer: So like... the modem is broken?

Agent: It's looking that way, unfortunately. At this point, I think we're going to need to get you a replacement modem sent out. But before I do that, let me see if there's anything else we can rule out. Are you using any splitters on the cable line coming into your house?

Customer: A splitter? I don't think so... (pause) I don't know what that even looks like.

Agent: It's basically a little connector that splits one cable into two. If you follow the cable that goes into your modem from the wall, does it split off anywhere?

Customer: (pause) Let me trace it... No, I don't see anything like that. It's just one cable going straight in.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Okay, James, I'm going to level with you. Based on everything we've tried and what I'm seeing on my end, I believe your modem has failed. Unfortunately, I'm not able to get it to re-establish a connection with our network.

Customer: What does that mean for me? Like, how long until I can get a new one?

Agent: That's a great question. I can definitely order a replacement modem for you right now. Standard shipping typically takes five to seven business days, but I can also look into expedited options. Let me check what we have available.

(typing sounds)

Agent: Okay, I'm seeing that we can do two-day shipping for an additional $25, or we can do standard shipping at no charge.

Customer: Two days? Okay, yeah, do the two-day shipping. I need to work.

Agent: Perfect. I'll get that set up for you. The modem should arrive by Thursday. You'll get a tracking number via email and text. In the meantime, unfortunately, you won't be able to use your internet service until the new modem arrives and is installed.

Customer: Yeah, I understand. This is just... it's really frustrating, you know? This modem was working fine yesterday.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. These things do sometimes fail unexpectedly. Once you receive the new modem, installation should be pretty straightforward. If you need any help setting it up, just give us a call back.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I will. So I should get an email with the shipping information?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. You'll receive an email with the tracking number and all the details. (typing sounds) I'm processing that order now for two-day shipping. Is the email address we have on file still current? It shows [inaudible].

Customer: Uh, no actually, can you change it? It's james.mitchell75@email.com.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, got that updated. So you'll get an email at james.mitchell75@email.com with all your tracking information. Your replacement modem is being sent out today and should arrive Thursday, as I mentioned.

Customer: Alright. Okay, thank you.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today, James?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Hopefully the new modem works and everything goes back to normal.

Agent: I hope so too. I apologize again for the inconvenience, and thank you for being a Frontier customer. If you have any questions before the modem arrives, feel free to reach out to us anytime.

Customer: Okay, I will. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day, James.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
