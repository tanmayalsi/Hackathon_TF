Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like two hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number on file.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. One moment... Okay, I see your account here. You're in the Riverside area, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet went out this morning. Have there been any recent storms in your area, or did anything change with your setup recently?

Customer: No, no storms or anything. It was working fine last night. I just woke up and tried to check my email and nothing. The modem's on, I can see the lights, but I'm not getting any internet.

Agent: Okay, good information. Let me ask you a few questions. What color are the lights on your modem right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) there's a blue light, it's on. And there's like a green one I think... no wait, it's blinking orange.

Agent: Okay, so you've got a solid blue and a blinking orange. That's actually indicating that we might be having a connection issue on our end. But let's run through a few quick troubleshooting steps just to be thorough. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. While we're waiting, have you noticed any issues with your service over the past few days? Any slowness or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. It's been working great actually. This is the first time in months that anything's been wrong.

Agent: That's good to know. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's plugged back in. I can see the lights coming back on... the blue one's steady again but... yeah, the orange one's blinking again.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm. Okay. Let me check something on our end. Can you grab your router as well? Is that in the same room?

Customer: Yeah, it's right here next to the modem. Why? Do I need to restart that too?

Agent: If you don't mind, yes. Let's restart that one as well. Go ahead and unplug it for thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. This is really frustrating, man. I work from home sometimes and I needed this internet today.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Hopefully we'll have you back up and running in just a few minutes here.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been about thirty seconds. Plugging it back in.

Agent: (pause) Let's give it about a minute to fully boot up and establish a connection.

Customer: (background noise of typing) Okay... lights are on on the router now. The internet light is... (pause) no, it's still not lighting up. That's the problem.

Agent: I see. So we're still seeing that blinking orange on the modem and the internet light on the router isn't coming on. Can you check one more thing for me? Is there a coaxial cable—that's like a thick cable with a connector on each end—running from the wall outlet into your modem?

Customer: Yeah, I can see that. It's connected.

Agent: Perfect. And it's tight? Nothing looks loose or damaged?

Customer: No, looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay. (pause, typing sounds) I'm actually looking at our network map here and I'm seeing some unusual activity in your area right now. Let me check with our technical team. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure. How long do you think this'll take?

Agent: I'm going to check our systems really quick. Should be just a minute.

Customer: Alright, go ahead. (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So here's what I'm seeing. There appears to be some kind of issue on our network infrastructure in your neighborhood. That would explain why your modem isn't getting a proper signal from our end.

Customer: Oh, so it's not my equipment?

Agent: No, your equipment looks fine from what we've tested. This is actually on Frontier's side. Unfortunately, I don't have an immediate solution for this at the moment, but I can absolutely escalate this to our field service team.

Customer: What do you mean you don't have a solution? How long is this going to take?

Agent: I understand your frustration. So what I can do is dispatch a technician to your location to investigate what's happening with the signal on our side. But I'll be honest, it could take twenty-four to forty-eight hours for them to get out there depending on demand.

Customer: Twenty-four to forty-eight hours? That's not acceptable. Isn't there anything you can do now?

Agent: Let me see what I can do. (pause, typing sounds) Let me try resetting your modem remotely. Sometimes that can re-establish the connection even if there's an issue on our network.

Customer: Okay, yeah, try that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm sending that command now. Give it about two minutes to process... Is your modem still powered on?

Customer: Yeah, it's still on. (pause) Okay, now it's... wait, it's restarting. The lights went off and they're coming back on. I can see the blue one solid... the orange one is... (pause) still blinking orange.

Agent: [inaudible] I'm not seeing any change on our end either. (pause) I'm sorry, but at this point, I think we really do need to get a technician out there.

Customer: This is ridiculous. I need internet today. Is there anything else we can try?

Agent: Unfortunately, I've exhausted the troubleshooting steps I can do remotely. Without more technical investigation at the network level, I don't have other options available from my end. But I want to get this prioritized for you. Let me see if I can flag this as urgent.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah. Please do.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm marking this as a network outage affecting service in your area. I'm going to schedule a technician visit for tomorrow morning. Can you be available between eight AM and noon?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? Can't they come today?

Agent: I wish I could guarantee that, but based on the current queue, tomorrow morning is the earliest I can get someone out. If you can provide a window where you'll be home, I can make a note on your account.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Yeah, I'll be home tomorrow morning. Eight to noon is fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get your contact number confirmed. That's 555-0847?

Customer: That's right.

Agent: Great. You'll receive a confirmation call or text message before the technician arrives. In the meantime, if anything changes with your service or if you notice the internet comes back on, please give us a call back and let us know. We can cancel the appointment if it does.

Customer: Alright. Will I be charged for this service call if it's on Frontier's end?

Agent: That's a great question. Since this appears to be a network-level issue on our side, there should be no charge for the technician visit. I'm going to make a note on your account about that.

Customer: Okay, well, I guess that's something.

Agent: I really do apologize for this situation. I know it's inconvenient, especially if you work from home. But we'll get this resolved for you tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the trouble. We'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
