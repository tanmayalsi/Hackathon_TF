# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I've tried unplugging everything and plugging it back in, but nothing's working. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that is. Let me pull up your account here and we can get to the bottom of this. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're in the Westside area. So you mentioned you've already tried unplugging and plugging everything back in?

Customer: Yeah, I did that like... twice. And I waited like five minutes in between to make sure everything reset properly. The modem's lights are all red right now, which definitely doesn't seem right.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. Red lights typically indicate a connectivity issue. Let me ask you a few more questions. Do you see any lights on the modem at all, or are they completely dark?

Customer: No, no, they're on. They're just... they're red. All of them.

Agent: Got it. And the router—do you have a separate router, or is everything in one unit?

Customer: Yeah, I have a separate router. It's also like... it's not showing the usual lights either. Usually it's got blue and green lights, but right now there's nothing.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so the router is completely dark. That's interesting. Here's what I'd like to try first. Can you unplug the modem for me and wait about thirty seconds? Just count it out.

Customer: Sure, one second. (background noise of unplugging) Okay, unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now I'm going to count down from thirty while you wait. Ready?

Customer: Yeah, ready.

Agent: (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay, it's plugged back in now. I'm watching the lights... they're... still red. Nothing's changing.

Agent: Still red, okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to send a signal to your modem to see if we're getting anything from our network. Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (pause) Hmm, okay. That's... I'm not getting a response from the modem on our end, which tells me there might be a service issue in your area or possibly an equipment problem. Let me ask you—when exactly did this stop working? Was it gradual or did it just go out all at once?

Customer: It was all at once. Like, I was working this morning and everything was fine, and then I tried to refresh my email and it just... nothing loaded. And I tried to restart my computer thinking maybe it was that, but then I realized the internet light on the modem was off, so I knew it wasn't my computer.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. Okay, so one more thing I want to try. Can you check the cable that goes into the modem? It should be coming from the wall. Is it plugged in securely?

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, it looks... it's plugged in. Let me try... (sound of jiggling) ...okay, I'm wiggling it a little and... nope, nothing changed. Still all red.

Agent: Alright, and that cable is definitely coming from the wall outlet, not from anything else?

Customer: Yeah, it's coming from the wall. There's a Frontier box mounted outside and it runs into the wall and then to the modem.

Agent: Perfect, that's what I needed to know. (typing sounds) Let me try something else here. I'm going to restart your service from our end. This should take about two to three minutes. Can you watch your modem while we do this?

Customer: Okay, I'm watching it now.

Agent: (pause) Alright, the restart is going through. So just keep your eyes on those lights and let me know if anything changes.

Customer: (long pause) Um... still red. It's been like... a minute now, maybe?

Agent: Yeah, that's normal. It might take a couple more minutes to fully cycle through. Just give it a moment.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Nope. Still the same. Everything's still red.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing something here. The modem is not connecting to our network at all, which is unusual. There could be a couple of things going on. One is there might be an outage in your area that I'm not seeing pop up on my system yet, or there could be an issue with the modem itself.

Customer: So what do we do? Like, how do we figure out which one it is?

Agent: Good question. So here's what I can do. I can check if there are any known outages in your area. Give me just a second. (typing sounds) I'm looking at the service map for your address. There are no reported outages right now, but sometimes they do take a few minutes to show up in our system. Have you had any service interruptions recently? Any bad weather or power outages?

Customer: Um, no. It's been clear all morning. And I didn't have any power outages or anything like that.

Agent: Okay. Given that the modem isn't responding to our network at all, I'm actually thinking this might be a hardware issue with the modem itself. These things do fail sometimes, unfortunately.

Customer: So you're saying I need a new modem?

Agent: It's looking that way, yeah. But let me try one more thing before we go down that road. Sometimes these modems have a reset button. Do you see a small reset button on the back of your modem? It's usually recessed.

Customer: (background noise) Let me look... yeah, I see it. It's like a tiny little button.

Agent: Right. Okay, I'm going to have you press that for about ten seconds. Fair warning, this will completely reset the modem to factory settings, but at this point we've exhausted most of the standard troubleshooting.

Customer: Okay, here goes. (pause) I'm pressing it... and holding... and... okay, it's reset. Now what?

Agent: Now we wait again. This can take a few minutes. The modem should cycle through its startup process.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, so I'm watching it now and the lights are... they're coming back on, but they're still red. They were red when it powered back up, and they're staying red.

Agent: (sighs) Still red, huh?

Customer: Yeah. I mean, I'm not an expert or anything, but this doesn't seem like it's normal, right?

Agent: No, you're absolutely right. This is not normal. At this point, I think the modem is malfunctioning. I wish I had better news. Typically when we see this behavior—where the modem isn't connecting to our network despite multiple reset attempts—it usually means the device itself needs to be replaced.

Customer: Okay, so what's the next step? How do I get a new one?

Agent: Well, I can definitely set up a technician visit for you. They would come out and replace the modem with a working unit. Or, if you're in a rush, we do have walk-in locations where you can pick up a replacement, but the technician visit is typically the best option because they can make sure everything is set up correctly.

Customer: How soon can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. What does your schedule look like? Are you available tomorrow or would you prefer later this week?

Customer: Tomorrow would be ideal, honestly. I need the internet back as soon as possible.

Agent: I understand. Let me see... (pause) Okay, I'm looking at tomorrow's schedule. We have a window between 8 AM and 12 PM that's available, or we have 1 PM to 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Um, the afternoon one. 1 to 5.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, so I have a technician appointment set for tomorrow, January 15th, between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will come to your address and replace that modem. You should receive a confirmation email and possibly a text message.

Customer: Okay, great. Is there anything I need to do to prepare or anything?

Agent: Just make sure someone is home to let them in, and have your account number handy just in case. They'll likely bring the new modem pre-configured, but having your account info helps speed things up.

Customer: Alright, I can do that. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to try and get my internet back today? Like, I really need to work and this is...

Agent: (pause) I hear you, and I'm sorry. Unfortunately, with the modem not connecting to our network, there's really nothing else I can troubleshoot on your end. The issue is on the hardware side. If you need internet urgently, you could potentially try a mobile hotspot or go somewhere public with WiFi in the meantime, but as far as your home service goes, we're going to need that new modem.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I guess I'll figure something out. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: I'm really sorry about this. I know it's frustrating. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Just... hopefully the technician can come tomorrow and get me back online.

Agent: Absolutely. And just to confirm everything: you've got a technician appointment tomorrow, January 15th, between 1 and 5 PM, and a new modem will be installed. If you have any questions or need to reschedule, just give us a call back or check your confirmation email for the phone number.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
