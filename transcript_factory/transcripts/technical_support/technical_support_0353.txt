Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, uh, my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back online. I've been without service for like two hours now.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I'm showing an account for... is this David Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, David. So your internet service went down this morning around... (pause) ...let me see here. I'm not showing any outages in your area currently, so let's walk through some troubleshooting steps. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is there any lights on your modem?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I'm looking at it right now. Um, the power light is on, but I think the internet light is red or orange or something. It's definitely not green like it usually is.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The orange light usually indicates a connection issue. Have you tried unplugging the modem and waiting about 30 seconds before plugging it back in?

Customer: No, I haven't actually. Let me try that right now.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead.

(pause - approximately 45 seconds of silence)

Customer: Okay, I unplugged it. I'm counting... thirty seconds. Alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Let's give it about a minute or so to fully restart and reconnect to the network.

(pause - approximately 60 seconds)

Customer: Hmm, the light is still orange. It's not changing to green.

Agent: Okay, still orange. No problem. Let's try a couple other things. Can you tell me... do you have a separate router, or are you using the modem that we provided?

Customer: Uh, I think it's just the modem. It's that white box that you guys installed a couple years ago.

Agent: Okay, so that's actually a modem-router combo unit. Let me check something on your account. (typing sounds) I'm seeing that you're on our standard fiber connection, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. I mean, that's what you sold me on, so... (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) Right, right. Okay, and just to confirm—you're not showing any connection on any of your devices? Like your phone, your computer, anything on Wi-Fi?

Customer: No, nothing. My laptop shows the network is available, but when I try to connect, it just says can't connect or something.

Agent: Got it. That tells me it might be a service issue on our end rather than just the modem. Let me try to refresh your connection remotely real quick. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm sending a refresh signal to your modem now. Can you keep watching that light and let me know if anything changes?

Customer: Okay, yeah, I'm watching it. (pause) Nope... still orange. Nothing's happening.

Agent: Still orange. Alright. (pause) Let me try one more thing. Can you check the back of your modem and see if there's a cable that looks a little different from the power cable? It should be like a thicker ethernet-looking cable?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, I see a few cables back here. There's like... a white one and then some black ones.

Agent: Okay, and can you check if any of those look loose or disconnected?

Customer: (pause) No, they all look pretty secure to me. They're all plugged in tight.

Agent: Okay, that's good. Let me try a factory reset on the modem. To do that, I'm going to need you to press and hold a small button on the back of the modem. It's usually recessed, so you might need like a paperclip or a pen.

Customer: Oh, uh... okay. Give me a second. (pause) Alright, I found it. How long do I hold it?

Agent: Hold it for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, doing it now. (pause) How long has it been?

Agent: Just keep counting to about 10.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm at 10. Releasing it now.

Agent: Great. Now the modem is going to restart and it's going to take about 3 to 5 minutes to fully come back online. This will reset it to factory settings, so we might need to set some things up again, but hopefully it'll get you reconnected.

(pause - approximately 90 seconds)

Customer: Um, Derek? It's been a couple minutes and... the light's still orange. Is this normal?

Agent: Hmm, it should be closer to green by now. Give it just another minute or two. Sometimes it takes the full five minutes.

(pause - approximately 90 seconds)

Customer: Still nothing. Still orange.

Agent: (pause) Okay, David, I'm going to be honest with you. What we're seeing here sounds like it might be a service issue on our end, possibly with your line coming into the house. The fact that the modem isn't reconnecting even after the factory reset tells me we might need to get a technician out to look at this.

Customer: Oh man, really? How long does that usually take? I need this working today if possible. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check availability. (typing sounds) So I do have some openings... we have a window tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have something on Friday afternoon. Unfortunately, I'm not seeing anything available for the rest of today.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better than Friday. Can you do that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get you scheduled. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm booking a technician for tomorrow, March 14th, between 8 AM and noon. Your confirmation number is 847-FRN-5503. Can I get a cell phone number for the technician to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0921.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. Got that. So to recap, we have a technician coming out tomorrow morning. Is there anything I can do for you in the meantime, or do you have any other questions?

Customer: No, I mean... I'm frustrated I'm without internet tonight, but I get it. You guys tried. Thanks for troubleshooting with me.

Agent: I really appreciate your patience, David. I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online today. The good news is that our technicians are really good at diagnosing these line issues, so hopefully it'll be a quick fix tomorrow. In the meantime, if you need anything, you can always call us back. Is there anything else I can help with?

Customer: No, that's all. Thank you.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier, David. We'll see you tomorrow morning. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
