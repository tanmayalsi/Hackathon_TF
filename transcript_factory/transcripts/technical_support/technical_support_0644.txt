Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just... it's completely down. I've been without service for like an hour now and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... uh, 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. So you're experiencing a complete outage, is that correct? Your internet isn't working at all?

Customer: Right, yeah. Nothing. The modem isn't even... I mean, it usually has those blue lights on it, and right now there's just nothing. It's like the whole thing is dead.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me just verify a couple of things first. Are you able to see if there are any lights on the modem at all? Even a red light or anything?

Customer: (pause) No, nothing. It's completely dark. Should I... should I unplug it?

Agent: Actually, let's try that in just a moment. First, let me check if there are any service outages in your area. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm not showing any reported outages on our end. That's good news. It means it's likely something we can troubleshoot. Can you tell me—have you had any storms or power issues recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The power's fine everywhere else in the house. It's just the modem that's... yeah.

Agent: Right, okay. So the power in your home is stable. That rules that out. Let me have you do this—can you unplug the modem from the power outlet?

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. Let's just leave that unplugged for about thirty seconds. While we're waiting, do you happen to know if you have a battery backup unit or anything connected to your modem?

Customer: Um... no, I don't think so. It's just plugged into the wall.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's back in. Now what?

Agent: Now let's give it about two minutes to boot back up. Sometimes the modem just needs that hard reset. While it's booting up, I'm going to ask you a couple more questions. Do you have a separate router or is everything in one unit?

Customer: No, it's... I think everything's in one box. The Frontier router.

Agent: Okay, good. And you said the modem was working fine before this happened? There wasn't any unusual activity or anything?

Customer: No, it was working fine this morning. I was using it all day and then like an hour ago, I went to check something on my laptop and nothing. Just dead.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let's see what we're looking at now. Are you seeing any lights on the modem yet?

Customer: Um... (pause) No. Still nothing. That's... that's not good, right?

Agent: Well, let's give it just another minute. Sometimes it takes a little while. Are you right there next to it?

Customer: Yeah, I'm staring at it right now. Still dark.

Agent: (pause) Okay. You know what, let me have you check something for me. Can you look at the cable that's going into the modem? Is it the coaxial cable—it's the one that looks like a TV cable?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's plugged in.

Agent: Is it plugged in tight? Sometimes they can work themselves loose. Can you just double-check by giving it a little twist to the right?

Customer: (pause) Oh, wait. It was a little loose. Let me... (pause) Yeah, I just tightened it. Okay.

Agent: Good. Now let's see if that helps. Keep an eye on those lights for me.

Customer: (pause) Still... still nothing. How long should this be taking?

Agent: (typing sounds) It should have at least some indication by now. Let me ask you this—when you look at the modem, is there a power light that should normally be on?

Customer: Yeah, usually there's like a power light, and then the internet light is blue. But right now, honestly, I don't see anything at all.

Agent: Okay. Let me have you do one more thing. Can you check the outlet you're plugging it into? Try unplugging the modem and plugging in something else—like a lamp or your phone charger—just to make sure that outlet is working.

Customer: (pause) Oh, good idea. (pause) Okay, I plugged in a lamp... and it turned on. So the outlet is fine.

Agent: (pause) Right, so the outlet's working. Let me try something else. Unplug the modem again, and this time, let's wait about a full minute before plugging it back in.

Customer: Okay. (pause) It's unplugged. (pause) Alright, waiting... (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Let me check your account one more time while we're waiting. (typing sounds) I'm going to see if there's anything on our backend that might be... (pause) Hmm. Actually, let me ask you—when you look at the back of the modem, is there a reset button?

Customer: A reset button? (pause) Yeah, I think I see one. It's like recessed in, right?

Agent: Exactly. That's the one. Before we hit that—I do want to warn you that a factory reset will erase any custom settings you might have, but at this point, I think we should try it. Can you use something like a paperclip or a pen to press it?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found a paperclip. I'm pressing it now. (pause) How long do I hold it?

Agent: Just hold it for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, held it down for like ten, fifteen seconds. Now what?

Agent: Now we wait again for it to reboot. This might take a little longer than before—maybe up to three or four minutes. While we're waiting, let me check if there's anything else going on. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any issues on our end, which is... it's a bit unusual given what you're describing.

Customer: (pause) So... what does that mean? Like, is it my modem?

Agent: Well, it could be a hardware issue with the modem itself. Let's give this reset a little more time and see if we can get any lights back on it.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, still nothing. It's been a couple minutes now and... nothing.

Agent: I see. Okay, let me be honest with you here. (pause) It's looking like we might be dealing with a hardware failure. The modem's not responding to any of our standard troubleshooting steps, and the reset doesn't seem to have done anything. 

Customer: So it's broken? Can you send me a new one?

Agent: We can definitely look into getting you a replacement modem. Before I do that, though, let me just... (typing sounds) ...let me see if there's any other way I can check this. You mentioned the power light should be on—that's typically the first thing that comes on when a modem is powered. If that's not coming on, it does suggest a power issue with the modem itself.

Customer: So what now? How long would a new modem take?

Agent: (pause) Well, that's a good question. I would normally schedule a technician to bring one out, and they could be there within two to three business days depending on your location. Or... in some cases, we can send one out in the mail, but that typically takes five to seven business days.

Customer: Two to three days? I really need my internet before then. Is there anything else we can try?

Agent: Let me be transparent with you—we've done a power cycle, we've checked the cables, we've verified the outlet, and we've done a factory reset. At this point, if the modem still isn't showing any signs of power, it's almost certainly a hardware issue. There's really nothing else I can troubleshoot remotely.

Customer: (pause) Okay... this is really frustrating. So what are my options here?

Agent: Alright, so here's what I can do for you. I can schedule a technician visit, and we can have them bring out a replacement modem. They can come out as early as tomorrow if we have availability in your area. We can also potentially rush ship one to you, though I'd have to check on any expedited shipping fees. Or, you could come pick one up at one of our local stores if that's convenient for you.

Customer: If I come pick one up, how quickly can I get one?

Agent: Actually, that's a great option. Let me pull up our store locations for you. (typing sounds) What's your zip code?

Customer: 55401.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so we have a store location about three miles from you. They're open until 7 PM today. If you're able to get there before then, we could have you set up in like an hour or so.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I can do that. That's better than waiting two days. So I just go in and tell them my account number?

Agent: Exactly. Just tell them your account number and that you need a replacement modem. They'll get you sorted out. They might need your ID just to verify, but it should be quick.

Customer: Alright. And they can help me set it up when I get home?

Agent: They should be able to get you the modem, but if you have any issues setting it up, just give us a call back and we can walk you through it.

Customer: Okay, I guess that works. I'm not happy about this, but... okay.

Agent: I really do apologize for the inconvenience. I know this is frustrating. The good news is you should be back online quickly once you get that new modem. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm just going to head to the store now.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for calling Frontier, and again, I apologize for the trouble. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
