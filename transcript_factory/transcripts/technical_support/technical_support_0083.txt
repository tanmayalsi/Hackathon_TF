# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm finding your account now. One moment... Alright, I've got it here. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. Can you tell me what you're experiencing exactly? Is your router powered on?

Customer: Yeah, the router is on. I can see the lights are there, but like... I don't know, nothing's working. My phone can't connect to WiFi, my computer won't connect. I tried unplugging and plugging it back in and that didn't help.

Agent: Good troubleshooting step there. Okay, so the router's powered on and you're seeing lights. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing? Are they solid, blinking, any red lights?

Customer: Um, there's a few lights. The power one is solid green. There's like a... I think it's the internet one? That's blinking orange. Is that bad?

Agent: That orange blinking light is actually what we need to focus on. That typically indicates the router is trying to establish a connection but hasn't fully synced yet. Before we go further, can you check if there's a cable running from the wall into the router? Like a fiber optic cable?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's there. It's the thin one, right? Yellow?

Agent: Perfect, that's the one. And is it firmly plugged in on both ends?

Customer: Let me see... (pause) Yeah, it looks pretty solid to me.

Agent: Great. Okay, so here's what I want you to try. I'm going to have you do a full reboot of the system. Unplug the power cable from the back of the router, and then unplug the fiber optic cable as well. Wait about 30 seconds, and then plug everything back in, starting with the fiber cable first.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) The fiber one first, right?

Agent: Yes, the fiber cable first, then the power cable.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) And now the power. (pause) Alright, it's booting back up.

Agent: Perfect. This should take about two to three minutes to fully reconnect. While we're waiting, can I get your email address just to have on file?

Customer: It's [inaudible]@gmail.com.

Agent: Thank you. Okay, so while that's rebooting, are you seeing any change in the lights yet?

Customer: (pause) Um, still blinking orange. It's been like 30 seconds though.

Agent: Right, give it a little more time. These routers can sometimes take a couple minutes to fully sync up. Are you experiencing any outages in your area that you're aware of? Have you checked with neighbors or anything?

Customer: No, I haven't. Actually, that's a good point. Let me think... I don't think so. Everything was working fine yesterday.

Agent: And you haven't had any recent storms or power outages on your end?

Customer: No, not that I know of.

Agent: (pause) Alright, checking the lights again?

Customer: (pause) Still orange. It's been like two minutes now.

Agent: Okay, that's a little longer than I'd like to see. Let me try something else. When you look at the back of the router, do you see a small recessed button? That's usually the reset button.

Customer: Oh, yeah. I see it. Why?

Agent: Don't press it yet. That's a factory reset and we want to avoid that if possible because it'll erase your WiFi settings. But I want you to try holding down the power button on the router for about 10 seconds to force a shutdown, then turn it back on.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...holding it now. (pause) It's off. (pause) Turning it back on. (typing sounds, then electronic sounds)

Agent: Good. Let's give this another minute or two.

Customer: (pause) Marcus?

Agent: Yeah, I'm here.

Customer: Still orange. Is this... is this a bigger problem?

Agent: Let me check your account on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your connection status right now. On my system, it's showing that your modem is offline. That tells me we're not getting a signal from the fiber line. That could be a few things—it could be an issue with the outside line, the connection at the neighborhood hub, or potentially the equipment on your end.

Customer: Oh. Okay. So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, I want to try one more thing before we escalate this. I'm going to send a signal down the line to try and wake up your modem. This should take just a moment. (pause) Alright, that's sent. Check those lights again.

Customer: (pause) Nope. Still the same. Still blinking orange.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Unfortunately, at this point, it sounds like we might have a service issue on our end. That could be the fiber line itself or an issue at our distribution point. I think we need to get a technician out to your location to run a full line diagnostic.

Customer: Oh man. How long is that going to take? I really need my internet back. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability... (typing sounds) We have availability for a technician visit tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have another slot the day after that in the afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow morning? I mean... (pause) Can you do it sooner than that? Like this afternoon?

Agent: Unfortunately, we're pretty booked for this afternoon. Tomorrow morning would be your soonest option.

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, okay. I guess I'll take the morning slot tomorrow.

Agent: Great. I'll get that scheduled for you. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before arrival, so just make sure you have someone there to let them in. Is it a house or an apartment?

Customer: It's a house. Will they need to go inside?

Agent: They might need to access the router and possibly check some connections inside, yes. So we'll have you on the schedule. I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all the details. In the meantime, if anything changes or if the internet miraculously comes back online, just give us a call back.

Customer: Alright. Yeah, I will. I mean, hopefully it works itself out overnight or something.

Agent: I hope so too. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get this sorted out for you tomorrow. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
