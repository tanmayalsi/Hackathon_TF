# Frontier Communications - Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because my internet just went out. Like, completely out. I've been without it for about an hour now and I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can you spell your last name for me?

Customer: It's B-R-O-W-N.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I've got you here. So your internet service went down about an hour ago. Have you tried unplugging the modem and router yet?

Customer: Um... no, actually I haven't. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, that's usually our first step. Go ahead and unplug the modem—that's the device with all the lights on it. Just pull the power cable out completely.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (background noise, muffled sounds) Yeah, I've got it unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now just leave that unplugged for about thirty seconds while I'm looking at your account here. (pause) And while we're at it, go ahead and unplug the router too if you wouldn't mind. That's the box with the antennas.

Customer: Oh, okay. Yeah, I see it. (background noise) Got it unplugged too.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, so I'm not seeing any outages in your area, which is a good sign. Let's wait about... another ten seconds or so, and then we can plug the modem back in first. Go ahead whenever you're ready.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm plugging it back in now. (pause) The lights are coming back on. It's got the blue and green lights on the top.

Agent: Excellent. And is one of those lights blinking or are they solid?

Customer: Um... they're blinking. They're like, slowly blinking.

Agent: That's normal. That means it's booting up. Give it about a minute to fully boot, and then go ahead and plug the router back in as well.

Customer: (pause) Okay, about a minute has passed. Plugging the router in now. (background noise, muffled sounds)

Agent: Great. Now while that's booting up, let me ask you a few questions. Have you noticed any storms in your area recently? Or any kind of damage to your lines outside?

Customer: No, I mean... it's been pretty clear today. I don't think there's been any storms or anything like that. Everything looked normal when I came home.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Alright, so the router should be booted up by now. Can you try connecting to your wifi? You should see your network name pop up on your device.

Customer: Yeah, let me grab my phone. (pause) Okay, I'm looking... and I see my network name, but when I try to connect... it's not... it's not working. It's like timing out or something.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Can you try forgetting the network and then reconnecting? On your phone, go into your wifi settings, find your network name, and hit the option to forget it.

Customer: (typing sounds, pause) Okay, it says "forget network" so I'm tapping that. Done. Now let me try to reconnect to it. (pause) Nope. Still not connecting. It's just showing that loading circle and then it says "unable to connect."

Agent: Alright, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your modem here... hmm. Can you look at the lights on your modem again? Specifically, is there an internet light or a "WAN" light? Do you see any red lights?

Customer: (background noise) Let me look. Okay, so I see blue, I see green, and... yeah, there's a red light. That's not good, right?

Agent: That's what we need to address. The red light typically means there's no internet signal coming into your modem from our network. Let me pull up your service address here to see if we can identify what might be happening. (typing sounds, pause)

Customer: Should I unplug it again?

Agent: Not yet. Let's try a couple other things first. Can you check if there's a reset button on your modem? Sometimes it's a small button on the back. Don't press it yet, just let me know if you see it.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, there's a little button here on the back. It says "Reset."

Agent: Okay, don't press that one—that'll erase all your settings. But is there any button that might say "Restart" or anything like that?

Customer: Hmm... I don't see anything else. Just the power and the reset button.

Agent: Alright. In that case, let's try one more restart. Go ahead and unplug the modem and the router again, but this time, leave them unplugged for about two minutes.

Customer: Two minutes? That's longer than before.

Agent: Yeah, sometimes it takes a little longer for the system to fully reset. (pause) I'm also looking at your account notes here, and I'm not seeing any obvious issues, which is... well, it's puzzling because there's definitely something preventing the signal from reaching your modem.

Customer: Could it be the weather? Like, my cable could be damaged?

Agent: That's definitely possible. We do have some lines that run outside. But you said there hasn't been any storms?

Customer: No, nothing that I've seen. It's been nice out all day.

Agent: Okay, well, let's see if this restart helps. Have you left them unplugged for two minutes now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's been about two minutes. Plugging them back in now. (background noise)

Agent: Alright, take your time. Let's give the modem a full minute to boot up again.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's booting. I see the lights... same thing. Blue, green, and... there's that red light again.

Agent: (sigh) Okay, I see. Let me try a different approach here. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem from our end. This should take just a moment. (typing sounds, pause) Alright, I've sent that. Can you tell me if the lights change at all?

Customer: (pause) No... nothing's changed. Still the same red light.

Agent: [inaudible] ...unfortunately, that red light on the modem indicates there's no signal being received from our network at your location. This could be a few things—it could be an issue with the external line, a problem with the network equipment in the area, or possibly something with your modem itself... but given that we've tried multiple restarts and different reset methods, my best guess would be an external line issue.

Customer: Oh no. So what does that mean?

Agent: It means we're probably going to need to send a technician out to your location to physically inspect the lines and the equipment. Do you have availability this week?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean... when are we talking? I work during the day.

Agent: We typically offer morning appointments, so that would be like, 8 AM to 12 PM, or afternoon appointments, 12 PM to 5 PM. Do either of those work for you?

Customer: Um... the afternoon would be better for me. What day?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) We have tomorrow afternoon available, or if you'd prefer to wait, we have Wednesday afternoon as well.

Customer: Tomorrow would be great. Tomorrow afternoon, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get you scheduled for tomorrow, March 15th, between 12 PM and 5 PM. You should receive a confirmation text and email with all the details. Is there anything else I can help clarify before I close out this ticket?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope the technician can figure it out.

Agent: I'm sure they will. I apologize that we couldn't resolve this over the phone, but unfortunately, when it comes to external line issues, we do need to have someone inspect it in person. Your reference number is 7749285. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a great day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
