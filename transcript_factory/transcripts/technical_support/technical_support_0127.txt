Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out this morning and I can't get it back up. I'm working from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll see what we can do. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm seeing your account here... it looks like you're on our Fiber 200 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you're in the Riverside area?

Customer: Correct, yeah.

Agent: Alright. So your internet is completely down right now? No connection at all?

Customer: Nope, nothing. My modem's on, the router's on, both lights are lit up, but I'm not getting any internet. I tried unplugging everything and replugging it back in, but that didn't work.

Agent: Okay, that's good troubleshooting on your part. Let me ask you a few questions. When you look at your modem, what color is the internet light? Is it green, red, or...?

Customer: Uh, it's... it's kind of blinking orange, I think? Or amber? It's definitely not green.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. An orange blinking light usually indicates that the modem is trying to connect but hasn't established a connection yet. Let me check if there are any outages in your area. (pause, typing sounds) I'm not seeing any reported outages right now in your zip code, so that's good news. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug your modem and wait about thirty seconds?

Customer: Sure, yeah. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Just count to about thirty in your head, or if you have a clock...

Customer: (pause) Okay, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Great. Now plug it back in and let's see if that light changes at all.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's back in. So... we're waiting for it to boot up?

Agent: Exactly. Just give it about two minutes to fully initialize. Sometimes these things take a minute.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I'm looking at it. Still orange. Still blinking.

Agent: Still blinking orange, okay. And your router, do you see any lights on the router?

Customer: Yeah, the power light is on and there's a couple other lights, but they're not... I mean, the internet light on the router isn't lit up either.

Agent: Right. So the router isn't getting a connection from the modem. Let's try resetting the router as well. Do you see a small reset button on the back?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's like a tiny button, right?

Agent: That's the one. Can you hold that down for about ten seconds?

Customer: (pause) Okay... holding it... (pause) ...and it's reset. The lights just went all crazy for a second.

Agent: That's normal. It's rebooting. Let's give that another minute or so to come back up. While we're waiting, let me ask — have there been any storms in your area recently? Any power outages or anything like that?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear weather all week. Nothing like that.

Agent: Okay, good. And when did you last have working internet? Was it yesterday?

Customer: Yeah, yesterday around noon everything was working fine. I was on a video call and everything. Then this morning I woke up and it was just... gone.

Agent: Alright. Let me check the line status here. (typing sounds, pause) Hmm, I'm actually seeing here that we might be detecting something on the line. Let me ask you something — did you see any service technicians in your area recently? Any work being done on the lines?

Customer: Um, not that I noticed. I didn't see anything.

Agent: Okay. Well, what I'm seeing in the system is that there might be an issue with the connection from our network to your modem. That orange blinking light usually means the modem can't sync with our network.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it the modem? Is it my stuff?

Agent: It could be a few things. It might be the modem itself, or it could be something on our end with your line. Let's try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? This will restore all the default settings. Usually that's the last thing we try before we escalate.

Customer: Okay, uh... how do I do that?

Agent: There should be a small reset button on the modem. You'll need to hold it down for about fifteen to twenty seconds this time, not just a quick press. It's going to turn off the modem completely.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm pressing it. (pause) The lights all went off. (pause) Now it's booting back up. We're waiting again?

Agent: Yep, just give it a few minutes to fully boot back up and try to connect.

Customer: (pause) This is taking a while...

Agent: I know, it's not fun. These things can take a minute or two sometimes.

Customer: (pause, long silence) Okay, so... it's been like two minutes now and it's still that same orange blinking light. Still nothing.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so the factory reset didn't resolve it. I'm going to be honest with you — at this point it seems like the issue is either with the modem hardware itself or there's something on our network side that's preventing your modem from syncing. Unfortunately, I'm not able to diagnose that fully over the phone.

Customer: So what do I do? I need this working today. I have calls coming up.

Agent: I completely understand. What we can do is schedule a technician to come out and take a look at both the modem and the line. They'll be able to determine if it's the equipment or if there's a line issue.

Customer: How soon can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) The earliest we have available is tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sigh) Tomorrow? That's... yeah, I guess that'll have to work. Can we do morning instead?

Agent: Unfortunately, tomorrow's morning slots are booked, but we do have an opening on Thursday morning between 8 and 11 AM if that works better for you?

Customer: Thursday morning is better, but that's two days from now. Can't you get anyone out today?

Agent: I apologize, but today's appointment slots are full. We're pretty booked up. But I can definitely get you down for Thursday morning, and in the meantime, do you have a mobile hotspot you could use to stay connected?

Customer: I mean, I guess I could use my phone, but that's not ideal. My work uses a lot of data. But... I guess I don't have a choice.

Agent: I'm sorry about that. We'll definitely get this resolved for you Thursday morning. Let me get that scheduled. Your address is 447 Maple Drive, Riverside?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. I've got you scheduled for Thursday, September 12th between 8 and 11 AM. Is there a preferred contact number for the technician to call when they're on the way?

Customer: (pause) That's fine, just use the number I called from.

Agent: Perfect. I've got that noted in your account. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly with the appointment details and the technician's information. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... no. I just hope they can fix it Thursday.

Agent: We'll take good care of you. I'm sorry you're experiencing this issue, but I assure you our technician will get to the bottom of it. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you Thursday morning.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
