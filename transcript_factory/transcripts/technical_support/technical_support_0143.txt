# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. So, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried unplugging the modem a couple times, but nothing's working. I'm without internet right now.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. And can I get the name on the account please?

Customer: It's Michael Hernandez.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got your account here. I see you're on our fiber service at that location. So you mentioned you already tried unplugging the modem—that's a great first step. Let me ask you a few questions. When the internet went out, did you notice any lights on the modem? Are any of them lit up right now?

Customer: Um, yeah. There's... let me look here. There's a red light on. It's just solid red.

Agent: Okay, solid red. That typically indicates there's no connection coming in from our network. Let me check on our end to see if there's an outage in your area. (pause, typing sounds) ...Can you tell me your service address as well, just to confirm?

Customer: Yeah, it's 342 Maple Street, apartment 3B, in Portland.

Agent: (typing) 342 Maple, 3B. Got it. Okay, Michael, I'm not seeing a widespread outage in your area at the moment, which is good news and bad news. It means the issue is likely specific to your connection. Let's try a few things. First, can you locate your modem and router for me?

Customer: Yeah, they're right here on my desk actually.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so what I'd like you to do is unplug the modem first—the device that has the red light. Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's leave that unplugged for about 30 seconds. While we wait, let me ask—have you had any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine, actually. It was just... I was working and then boom, just cut out.

Agent: Uh-huh. Okay, 30 seconds should be about up. Go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: (pause) And we'll give it about a minute to boot back up. Those lights should start cycling through some colors—you might see blue, white, or green lights moving around.

Customer: Okay, so... (pause) ...I'm seeing some lights flashing now. There's like a blue light that's... yeah, it's kind of flickering.

Agent: Good, good. That's normal. It's trying to reconnect. Let's give it another 30 seconds or so.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, yeah, the blue light is still there.

Agent: Is it steady blue, or still flickering?

Customer: Um, it's flickering still. It keeps going on and off.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay, and your router—the other device there—what's that showing?

Customer: The router? Um... (pause) ...it's completely dark. No lights at all.

Agent: No lights on the router at all?

Customer: No, nothing.

Agent: Okay. Let me check something. Can you see if there's a cable—it's usually yellow or white—connecting your modem and router together?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's connected.

Agent: Perfect. Can you try unplugging that cable from the modem end and plugging it back in? Just... push it in real firm to make sure it clicks into place.

Customer: (pause, sound of movement) Okay... I'm pulling it out... and... plugging it back in. I'm pushing it in... (pause) ...okay, it's plugged in.

Agent: Alright. Any change on the lights yet?

Customer: (pause) No, the router is still dark. The modem still has that blue flickering light.

Agent: Still the same. Okay. Let me check something else. Can you look at the modem and see if there's a port—it'll look like a small plug—that says "ONT" or "Network In"? It might have a cable running to it.

Customer: Um... let me see... (pause) ...I think I see it. There's one on the back that says "Network In" but... I don't see a cable going to it.

Agent: (pause) You don't see a cable there?

Customer: No, it's just... it looks empty. There's no cable plugged into it.

Agent: Hmm, that's interesting. Michael, do you have... could there be a cable near there that's disconnected? Sometimes they can get knocked out.

Customer: (pause) Let me look under here... no, I... I don't see anything. Just... no cables around. This is the first I'm hearing about that port, to be honest.

Agent: (pause) Okay. You know what, this could be something that happened during an electrical surge or something that might've caused a disconnection on the outside line. I think what we might need to do here is schedule a technician to come out and check the fiber connection at your apartment.

Customer: A technician? When would that be?

Agent: Well, let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) We have openings tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have evening slots the day after tomorrow if that works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be great, actually.

Agent: Excellent. (typing) I'm getting that booked for you right now. Just to cover my bases though, before we wrap up, can you try one more thing for me?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: Can you do a full power down? Unplug the modem and the router—both devices.

Customer: Okay... (pause, sound of unplugging) ...done. They're both unplugged.

Agent: Leave them unplugged for about a minute. I'm going to do a reset on my end as well to see if that helps.

Customer: (pause) Okay. (long pause) It's been a minute. Should I plug them back in?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause, sound of plugging in) Okay, it's in.

Agent: And let's give it about two minutes this time. We want to see if we get a solid green light, or if we're still seeing red or that flickering blue.

Customer: (long pause) ...I'm still seeing the blue flickering. Same as before.

Agent: (pause) Still the same?

Customer: Yeah, it's not changing.

Agent: Alright, Michael, I think the technician visit is definitely the right call here. This seems like a line issue on our end that needs to be investigated physically. So I have you scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, between 8 AM and noon. A technician will come out to 342 Maple, apartment 3B.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good.

Agent: Excellent. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly with those details. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, Derek.

Agent: Of course, Michael. Sorry we couldn't get you back online today, but our technician should have you all set tomorrow. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you, Michael. Bye now.
