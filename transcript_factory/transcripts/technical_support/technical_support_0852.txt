# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and everything, but nothing's working.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. And just to confirm, what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got your account here. I can see you're on our Frontier Fiber 200 plan. So the internet just went out about an hour ago, you said?

Customer: Yeah, roughly an hour. Maybe a little less. I was just working from home, and boom—everything just stopped.

Agent: Okay, and you mentioned you already tried unplugging the modem. Did you happen to wait about 30 seconds before plugging it back in?

Customer: Yeah, I did that. I waited like a minute actually, to be safe. And nothing. The modem still just has the red light on it. Like, no green lights at all.

Agent: Red light only—okay, that's helpful information. And when you say no green lights, what about the power light? Is that on?

Customer: Um, yeah, the power light is on. But like, no internet lights. Just red, and it's just sitting there flashing.

Agent: Alright, so we're getting power to the device, which is good. Let me ask you this—do you see the cables connected to the modem? There should be a power cable and then an ethernet or coax cable coming from the wall.

Customer: Yeah, let me check. (pause) Okay, so the power cable's definitely in. And there's like... it looks like a cable TV cord going into the back?

Agent: That would be the coax cable, yeah. Is that plugged in firmly?

Customer: Hold on, let me look closer. (pause) It looks pretty in there to me, but maybe... I can try to tighten it?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and give that a try. Just make sure it's hand-tight—don't use any tools or anything.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, I'm twisting it... it went a little bit. Was that loose?

Agent: Well, that could definitely be our issue then. Once you've got it tight, go ahead and unplug the modem again, wait about 30 seconds, and plug it back in. Then let me know what lights you're seeing.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) ...30 seconds... (pause) ...alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. How long does it usually take for the modem to fully boot up?

Customer: Um, I don't know. A minute or two?

Agent: That sounds about right. Let's give it about two minutes and then check what we're seeing.

Customer: (pause) Okay... so the power light came back on. That's good, right?

Agent: That's a good sign, yeah. What about the other lights? Are you seeing any green ones lighting up now?

Customer: (pause) I'm looking... no. Still just the red one. It's blinking less frequently now than it was, but it's still red.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, so the red light typically indicates there's no connection signal coming in from our network. The fact that it's blinking less could mean the modem is still initializing, so let's give it another minute or so and check again.

Customer: Okay... (longer pause) ...alright, it's been a couple minutes. Still red though.

Agent: Alright, let me check our system on this end to see if there are any outages in your area or any issues with your account line. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, and your line shows as active on our end. That's interesting.

Customer: So that's... that's good, I guess? But my internet's still not working.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me have you try a couple more things. First, can you unplug the modem one more time?

Customer: Yeah... (pause) ...it's unplugged.

Agent: And this time, while it's unplugged, I want you to go find the little reset button. It's usually on the back or the bottom of the modem, might be recessed in a little hole.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking... (pause) ...I see a little pinhole kind of thing on the bottom.

Agent: That's probably it. Once you plug the modem back in, wait for about 30 seconds, and then use a paperclip or something small to press that button for about 10 seconds. But do not do this yet—only after you plug it back in and wait.

Customer: Okay, got it. So plug in, wait, then press the button with a paperclip. Got a paperclip right here.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it in now.

Customer: (pause, rustling) Plugging it back in now... (pause) Okay, power light's on again... waiting... (pause) ...alright, about 30 seconds. I'm pressing the button.

Agent: [inaudible]

Customer: (muffled) Sorry, what was that?

Agent: I said, how long have you been pressing it?

Customer: Um, I don't know, like 10 seconds or so?

Agent: Okay, you can let go. The modem's going to restart now, so this might take a bit longer. We should see it go through its startup sequence.

Customer: (pause) Okay... the lights are doing different things now. It's like cycling through... (pause) ...okay, the power light came back on, and I'm seeing like an orange light now?

Agent: Orange is good—that means it's connecting. How long ago did you let go of the reset button?

Customer: Maybe 30 seconds ago?

Agent: Alright, the orange light means it's trying to establish a connection. Let's wait another minute or two to see if that orange turns to green.

Customer: (longer pause) Okay, it's been a couple minutes. Still orange.

Agent: Still orange, alright. (pause, typing sounds) Let me check your modem settings on my end here. (pause) Hmm. I'm actually not seeing your modem coming online in our system. It's possible there's an issue with the modem itself or there's something else going on at your equipment.

Customer: So like... what does that mean?

Agent: Well, a few things could be happening. It could be that your modem has had some kind of hardware failure, or there might be an issue with the connection line coming into your house. Let me ask you this—when was the last time your internet was working normally?

Customer: Last night. Everything was fine. I shut my computer down before bed, and this morning when I tried to use it, nothing.

Agent: And you didn't have any storms last night, or power outages or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was fine when I went to bed.

Agent: Okay. Well, based on everything we've tried, I think we might need to get a technician out to your location. It could be either a modem issue or possibly something with the line coming into your home, and that's something our tech team would need to diagnose in person.

Customer: So you can't... you can't fix it right now?

Agent: Unfortunately, I'm not able to from here, no. But the good news is we can get someone out to you. How does tomorrow work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean... (pause) ...I need my internet working, so yes, tomorrow works. What time frame are we talking about?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so we have a couple windows available tomorrow. We have a morning slot between 8 AM and 12 PM, or an afternoon slot between 1 PM and 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: The afternoon slot, I think. 1 to 5?

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, so I have a technician scheduled to come out tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Your confirmation number is 447892. Do you want me to repeat that?

Customer: No, I got it. 447892.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, the best number to reach you at would be the number on file here, which is 555-0147?

Customer: That's my account number. My phone number is 555-0298.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me update that. Okay, 555-0298. Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today, David?

Customer: No, I guess not. Just... hopefully the tech can get this fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I understand. I apologize that we couldn't resolve this over the phone. Our technician will be able to figure out exactly what's going on and get you back up and running. Your confirmation number is 447892, and we'll see you tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM.

Customer: Alright, thanks I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, and thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too.
