Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yes, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I'm working from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'm going to do everything I can to help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get your name please?

Customer: It's David. David Chen.

Agent: Great, David. Thanks for that. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Is it completely out, or are you experiencing slow speeds?

Customer: No, it's completely out. There's no connection at all. The router's on and everything, but like... nothing's working. I can't even get the wifi to show up.

Agent: Okay, so the router's powered on. Let me ask you this—do you see any lights on the front of the router? Like, are they lit up at all?

Customer: Um, let me look. (pause) Yeah, I see... there's a power light that's green. And then there's like a couple other lights, but they're red I think. Or orange? It's hard to tell from here.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. The red or orange lights usually indicate either a connection issue or that the router isn't communicating with our network properly. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm seeing your account. How long has the service been out exactly?

Customer: Like I said, since this morning. Maybe around 8 AM? It's been about four hours now.

Agent: Got it. And before it went out, was everything working fine? No issues yesterday or anything?

Customer: No, everything was totally normal. I was working fine this morning, and then I went to grab coffee and when I came back, nothing.

Agent: Alright. Well, let's try a few things. First, I want you to locate the modem—that's a separate device from the router. It might be in a closet or by a window. Do you know where it is?

Customer: The modem? Um... (pause) I think it's... yeah, it's in the hallway closet. I think. Or is it the same as the router?

Agent: No, they're two separate devices. The modem is usually a smaller box, often white or black, and it has thicker cables coming out of it. The router is what broadcasts your wifi.

Customer: Oh okay, hold on. Let me go check. (background noise, footsteps) Yeah, I found it. There's a box out here in the closet.

Agent: Perfect. What color is it?

Customer: It's white. Pretty small.

Agent: Okay, that sounds right. Now, look at the lights on the front of that modem. Are you seeing any lights at all?

Customer: (pause) No, actually. No lights. Is that bad?

Agent: That would explain the issue. It sounds like the modem has lost power or isn't getting a signal. Can you check the power cable? Make sure it's plugged in securely on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it now. (sounds of movement) The cable looks... it's plugged into the outlet. But it doesn't look like it's pushed all the way into the modem. Let me...

Agent: Go ahead.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm pushing it in. (pause) Oh! Okay, I see a light now. It's amber.

Agent: Good, that's progress. Now, we need to give the modem a few moments to boot back up. That light should eventually turn blue or white. While we wait, let me check on our end if there have been any outages in your area. (typing sounds) Hold tight for just one second.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area today, so that's good news. How are those lights looking now?

Customer: Um, still amber. Maybe a little brighter? But it's not blue or white yet.

Agent: Give it another minute or so. Sometimes these can take a bit to fully initialize. 

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been like a minute... still amber though.

Agent: Alright, let's try something else. Can you unplug the power cable from the modem completely? Just pull it out.

Customer: Yeah, I can do that. (pause) Done.

Agent: Good. Leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. This is called a power cycle and it can help reset the device.

Customer: (pause) Okay... thirty seconds. So... should I just wait here?

Agent: Yeah, just count it out or look at your phone.

Customer: (pause) [inaudible] ...and done. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's plugged in.

Agent: Alright, and now we'll wait for those lights to come back on. It might take about a minute or two.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see lights now. They're... amber still, but there are more of them. Like three or four lights now.

Agent: Perfect. That's what we want to see. One of those should turn white or blue in a moment, which means we've got a signal. Go ahead and give it another thirty seconds or so.

Customer: (pause) Alright. How's that looking? Any change?

Agent: Just give it another moment. Sometimes the service takes a little time to fully establish, especially after it's been down.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I'm looking at it... still all amber though. It's been like two minutes now.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) David, I'm looking at your modem connection status here and it's showing as offline. That's unusual. Let me ask you this—when you look at the cable coming out of the modem, the one that goes to your wall outlet—is that cable damaged at all?

Customer: (pause) The cable? Let me look. I don't... I don't think so? It looks fine from what I can see.

Agent: Okay. And the other cable coming out of the modem—the one that might go to the wall or another device—does that look okay too?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. Everything looks pretty normal out here.

Agent: Alright. Well, I want to try one more thing from your end. Can you do a full restart of your router as well? Unplug the power for about thirty seconds, then plug it back in?

Customer: Sure, let me... yeah, I'll go unplug it. (background noise) Okay, unplugging. (pause) Thirty seconds... (pause) Plugging back in. Done.

Agent: Perfect. Let's wait for that to boot back up. In the meantime, let me see if I can do some diagnostics from our end here. (typing sounds) Alright, David, so I'm checking our systems and I'm still not getting a connection from your modem. That's... that's concerning. It's almost like the modem itself might be offline or there's an issue with the line coming into your house.

Customer: So like... what does that mean? Is there something wrong with my equipment?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be the modem is faulty, it could be a line issue, or there could be a service disruption in your area that our system isn't showing yet. How are those lights on the modem looking now?

Customer: (pause) Still amber. The lights are still all amber. They haven't changed.

Agent: Still not connecting. (pause) Okay, David, unfortunately I'm not able to get your service back online from here, and the troubleshooting steps we've tried should have worked if it was just a power issue. I think at this point we need to get a technician out to your house to physically check the equipment and the line.

Customer: A technician? How long would that take? I really need my internet working.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what appointments we have available. (typing sounds) Okay, so our next available appointment is tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I need this fixed today though. I'm working from home and I've already lost like four hours.

Agent: I hear you, and I'm sorry. Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day appointments available. But our technician can usually diagnose and fix most issues pretty quickly once they get there. 

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Yeah, I... okay, fine. Tomorrow then. 1 to 5?

Agent: Yes, 1 to 5 PM tomorrow. Can I get a callback number where we can reach you?

Customer: It's the same number on the account.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, this is for the address on file at 447 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. Your appointment is scheduled, and you should receive a confirmation text shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (pause) No, I guess that's it. I just... I hope it gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident our technician will get you back up and running. I apologize for the inconvenience. We really appreciate your patience. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, thank you.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, David. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
