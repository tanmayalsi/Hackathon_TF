# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here... and I see your account. Your service address is 428 Maple Street in Cheyenne, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you had any storms in your area recently, or has there been any construction work?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine this morning. I was watching a video and then it just... cut out.

Agent: Okay, and when you say you unplugged everything, did you unplug the modem and the router?

Customer: Yeah, I did both. I waited like thirty seconds and plugged them back in, but nothing happened.

Agent: (typing sounds) That's a good troubleshooting step. So when you power them back on, what lights are you seeing on the modem? Are any of them lit up at all?

Customer: Um... (pause) okay, so there's a power light that's on, it's green. But the internet light... I think it's the one that looks like the WiFi symbol? It's red and it's not blinking or anything.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The red light typically indicates there's no signal coming in from our network. Let me check on our end to see if there are any outages in your area.

(typing sounds, pause)

Agent: I'm not seeing any reported outages on Maple Street right now, so the issue is likely with either your modem or the line itself. Can you tell me... do you have any other devices that might be connected to your modem right now? Like a computer, TV, anything?

Customer: I have my laptop plugged in, but it's not connected to anything obviously. And I've got a smart TV, but I'm not even sure if it was connected.

Agent: Okay. So let me walk you through a couple more things. Can you check the cables at the back of your modem for me? I want to make sure the coaxial cable—that's the thick cable that comes from the wall—is screwed in tight.

Customer: (pause, rustling sounds) Yeah, hold on... okay, I'm looking at it now. Um, it looks pretty tight, but let me try to tighten it a bit more. (sound of twisting)

Agent: Good.

Customer: Yeah, it moved a little. But I'm not seeing any change on the lights.

Agent: Okay, let's give it just a moment. Sometimes it takes a minute or two for the modem to resync with the network. Can you watch those lights for me for about thirty seconds?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... nothing yet. The internet light is still red.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something on my end. I'm going to reboot your modem from here, which might take about two to three minutes. Can you give me a moment?

Customer: Sure, yeah. Take your time.

(hold music plays softly in background, pause approximately 30 seconds)

Agent: Okay, I've initiated the reboot. While we're waiting, can you tell me... when was the last time you had this service installed or had a technician out to your location?

Customer: Um, I think... it was about three years ago? When we first got Frontier set up. We haven't had any problems since then, so there hasn't been a reason to have anyone out.

Agent: That's great. And you haven't made any changes to your setup recently? Moved the modem, anything like that?

Customer: No, it's been in the same spot the whole time. On the shelf in my bedroom.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Let me check... I'm still waiting for the modem to fully reboot. Sometimes these can take a few minutes. Can you tell me what model of modem you're using?

Customer: Um... I'm looking at it now. It says, uh... FR-1200?

Agent: Actually, I think the model number might be different. Can you look for a sticker on the bottom or the back? It usually starts with "FR" or sometimes it's a model that starts with "G" or "N".

Customer: (rustling sounds) Oh, okay, I see it. It says "NETGEAR N300" is on the label here.

Agent: Ah, okay, that's helpful. That's actually one of our standard modems. And the lights... is the internet light still red?

Customer: Yeah, still red. Yeah, it hasn't changed.

Agent: Okay. (pause, typing sounds) So the reboot doesn't seem to have resolved it. Let me try one more thing. I'm going to send a signal refresh to your modem. You shouldn't see any lights change this time, but just let me know if anything does happen in the next minute or so.

(pause, typing sounds)

Agent: Alright, I've sent that through. How's it looking?

Customer: (pause) Um... same thing. Still red.

Agent: Okay. (pause) I have to be honest with you, at this point, the issue is likely with either the modem itself or the line coming into your home. Since the modem reset didn't help and the lights aren't responding the way they should be...

Customer: So what does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: Possibly. But to really diagnose this properly, I think we're going to need to get a technician out to your location. They can check the line, test the connection, and if the modem needs to be replaced, they can do that for you on the spot.

Customer: How long does that usually take? When could someone come out?

Agent: Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so we have openings... we could get someone out there tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we also have a slot on Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. Can I do that?

Agent: Absolutely. (typing sounds) I'm going to schedule a technician visit for tomorrow, May 15th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. You'll need to be home to let them in. And what's the best phone number to reach you at if they need to call ahead?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as my account.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) And just to confirm your address again—428 Maple Street in Cheyenne?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you're all set. A technician will be out tomorrow morning. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I really hope they can fix it. I work from home sometimes and I needed this.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm sorry you're dealing with this. But our technician should be able to get you sorted out tomorrow. If for any reason you need to reschedule, just give us a call back and we can adjust the appointment.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
