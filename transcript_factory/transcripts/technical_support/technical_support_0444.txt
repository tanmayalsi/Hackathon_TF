Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here... And I'm showing this is for... James Patterson at 412 Maple Street?

Customer: That's right, yes.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have there been any storms in your area, or did anything happen before it stopped working?

Customer: No, no storms or anything like that. I just... I woke up this morning and tried to check my email and nothing was loading. And then I checked the modem and, um... (pause) I'm looking at it right now and it's got some lights on it, but I'm not sure what they're supposed to look like.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Can you tell me what color the lights are and which ones are lit up?

Customer: Uh, so there's a green light, and then there's an orange one that's blinking. Is that bad?

Agent: Hmm, so the orange blinking light typically indicates that there's a connection issue. Let me walk you through a couple of quick things. First, can you tell me—do you have a modem and a separate router, or is it all in one unit?

Customer: I think it's all in one? It's that box that came from you guys.

Agent: Right, so that's our all-in-one modem-router combo. Perfect. Okay, here's what I'd like you to do. Can you unplug the power cable from the back of the modem for about 30 seconds? That'll do a hard restart.

Customer: Okay, give me a second... (pause) Yeah, I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. Just hold on for about 30 seconds while that's powering down completely.

Customer: (pause) Alright, 30 seconds is up.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in... (pause) Let me wait for it to boot back up here.

Agent: Yeah, that usually takes about a minute or two. While we're waiting, let me ask you this—have you noticed any loose cables going into the modem? Sometimes they can come unplugged.

Customer: Um, let me check... No, everything looks pretty tight back here. Wait, okay, the lights are changing now. I'm seeing... the green light is solid now, but the orange one is still blinking.

Agent: Okay, so the green solid is good—that means power is stable. But that orange blinking could mean a few things. Is there any red light showing up at all?

Customer: No red light. Just the green and the orange.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else. Can you try connecting to the internet now? Maybe open up a browser and see if anything loads?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm trying... (pause) Nope, nothing. Still not working. The page isn't loading.

Agent: Got it. Okay, so I'm checking your account here, and I'm not seeing any service outages reported in your area, which is good. Let me check the status of your modem on our end. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm showing that the modem is... it's actually not connecting to our network properly. That's probably what's causing the issue.

Customer: Oh, so something's wrong with the modem?

Agent: It looks like it might be. But let me try a couple more things before we go down that road. Can you check the cable that goes from your wall outlet into the modem? The coaxial cable—it's the one that looks kind of like a thicker phone cord with the metal ends.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. Let me make sure it's... (pause) It seems pretty tight.

Agent: Okay, try unscrewing it just a little bit and then screwing it back in. Sometimes it just needs to be reseated.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm doing that... Okay, it's back in. (pause) Should I restart it again?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and do another power cycle. Same thing—unplug it for 30 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) I'm waiting for the lights again...

Agent: (pause) Let me know what you're seeing.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... same thing. Green light solid, orange blinking. Still not working.

Agent: Alright, I'm going to be honest with you, James—this is pointing to either an issue with the modem itself or possibly a problem with the line coming into your house. Since we've done the restarts and reseated the cable and it's still not connecting to our network, I'm thinking the modem might need to be replaced. But let me see if I can get a technician out there to check the line first, just to rule that out.

Customer: (sighs) Okay... how long would that take?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... We have technicians available tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could schedule something for later this week if that doesn't work for you.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works. I need to get this fixed, so... yeah, let's do tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, December 14th, between 8 AM and noon. A technician will come out and run some diagnostics on your line and the modem. Can you confirm that address is still 412 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And is that phone number we have on file—555-0147—the best way to reach you?

Customer: Uh, that's actually my landline. Can you use my cell? It's 555-0289.

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely, I've updated that to 555-0289. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive, just so you know to expect them.

Customer: Okay, sounds good.

Agent: And just so you know, if it turns out to be the modem, there's no charge to replace it under your service agreement. If it's a line issue, we'll take care of that as well.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. So I just have to wait until tomorrow?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. I know that's not ideal, but our tech team will get this sorted out for you first thing in the morning. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Again, we have you scheduled for tomorrow morning. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll get your internet back up and running.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
