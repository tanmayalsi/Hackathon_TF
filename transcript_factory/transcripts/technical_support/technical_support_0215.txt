# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm having trouble with my internet. It's just completely down right now, and I've got work I need to do from home today.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here. Let me just... one second... Alright, I see your account. You're at 2156 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet is completely down? Are you able to see any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, let me look. (pause) Okay, so the modem has like a red light on it, and nothing else is lit up. The router—I'm not even sure where the router is, to be honest. I think it might be in the closet by the front door.

Agent: Okay, that red light on the modem is actually what we want to troubleshoot. That typically means there's no connection coming into your home. Before we dig too deep though, let's just do a quick power cycle. Can you unplug the modem for me?

Customer: Sure, doing that now. (pause) Yep, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Let's wait about thirty seconds while that powers down completely.

Customer: Okay... (long pause) ...alright, it's been a minute probably.

Agent: Perfect, go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged back in. (pause) Um, it's starting to boot up. I see some lights flickering now.

Agent: Good, good. That's what we want to see. Give it about a minute or two to fully boot up and establish a connection. Just let me know when things have settled down.

Customer: (pause) Alright, so... I'm still seeing that red light. The other lights aren't really coming on like they should be.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That red light is still there—it's still solid red?

Customer: Yeah, it's solid. Nothing's changed really.

Agent: Alright, let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) Can you tell me what kind of modem you have? There should be a model number on the front or back of it.

Customer: Um... (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it. It says... FI-GIGA-2 or something like that?

Agent: FI-GIGA-2, okay, yeah we use those. And just to confirm, you haven't had any issues with your service recently? Like, was everything working fine yesterday?

Customer: Yeah, actually, it was working fine when I went to bed last night. This morning when I went to log in for work, nothing. The internet just wasn't there.

Agent: Okay. (typing sounds) I'm going to check if we're seeing any service issues in your area or any problems on our end with your line. (pause) Let me see here... (longer pause) Alright, so on my end I'm actually not seeing any outages reported in your area, and the line itself appears to be active, which is interesting.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could mean a couple of things. It could be an issue with the modem itself, or there might be a problem with the line coming into your house that we're not detecting yet. Let me have you try something. Can you check the cable coming into the modem? It should be a coaxial cable—kind of looks like a TV cable.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's connected to the back.

Agent: Okay, can you give it a little tug to make sure it's secure? Sometimes these can come loose.

Customer: (pause) I gave it a pull and it's pretty tight. Doesn't seem loose.

Agent: Alright. Here's another thing we can try. Do you see any other cables plugged in besides the internet cable? Like, is there a phone line or anything?

Customer: (pause) No, just the one cable.

Agent: Okay, good. Um... (pause) Let me try accessing your modem directly. Can you tell me the Wi-Fi name that usually shows up when you look for networks?

Customer: Yeah, it should be FRONTIER-2847 or something similar.

Agent: And are you able to see that network right now?

Customer: (pause) Let me check my laptop... No, I don't see it. Nothing's coming up for that.

Agent: Hmm, that's unusual. Alright, let me put you on a brief hold here while I consult with our technical team to see if they can pull up any diagnostics on your line. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Sure, yeah.

Agent: (hold music, approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Okay, thank you for holding. I've checked with the team here, and we're going to need to do a bit more investigation. I'm going to reset your modem remotely, and this will take about five minutes. During this time, you'll see all the lights go out completely, and then it'll restart.

Customer: Okay, is that going to help?

Agent: It should help, yeah. Sometimes the modem gets into a weird state and needs to reset. But if this doesn't work, we might need to schedule a technician to come out and check the line outside.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, how long does that take?

Agent: So I'm resetting it now. (typing sounds) Initiating remote reset... and it should take about five minutes to complete the full cycle.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, it's black now. All the lights are off.

Agent: That's exactly what should happen. Just give it a few minutes and it should come back online.

Customer: (pause, approximately 3 minutes) Okay, uh... the lights are coming back on. I see some blinking, but... (pause) ...the red light is back. It's still that same red light.

Agent: It's still red?

Customer: Yeah. Same thing as before.

Agent: (pause) Okay, um... I'm not going to lie to you, that's not what we were hoping to see. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) Are you currently under any kind of construction or maintenance happening outside your home? Sometimes our lines get accidentally severed.

Customer: No, nothing that I'm aware of. I mean, there might be some work happening on the street eventually, but not that I've noticed.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I've tried the power cycle and the remote reset, and the modem is still showing that red light, which indicates no signal coming from our line. At this point, what I'd really recommend is getting a technician out to your property to check the external line and the connection point.

Customer: How quickly can someone get out here? Like, I really need internet today for work.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. (pause) So the earliest I can get someone out would be... today is Wednesday... we have an opening this afternoon between two and four PM, or we could do tomorrow morning between eight and ten AM.

Customer: This afternoon would be better. Can you do that?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, so I've got a technician scheduled to come out to 2156 Maple Drive today between 2 and 4 PM. The ticket number is 847293. They should be able to diagnose whether it's an external line issue or something else.

Customer: Okay, great. Is there anything else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, with that red light staying on, there's not much more we can troubleshoot on your end. The issue is on our side. Just keep the modem powered on and connected, and the tech will be able to take it from there when they arrive.

Customer: Alright, I guess I'll have to tether to my phone for work today then.

Agent: Yeah, that might be your best bet. I'm sorry we couldn't get this sorted out over the phone. The technician should be able to fix whatever's going on. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Your technician appointment is set for today between 2 and 4 PM. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll get you back online soon.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
