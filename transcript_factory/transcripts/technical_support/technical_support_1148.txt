# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, uh... my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got work calls scheduled and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... um, 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. I'm pulling that up now. And just for verification, what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So the internet's been completely down since this morning, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, completely. No lights on the modem, nothing. Well, actually... wait, let me look again. The power light is on, but I don't see the internet light.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is on but no internet light. That's helpful. Let me walk you through some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me where your modem is located?

Customer: It's, uh, on a shelf in my office. It's the white box, right?

Agent: Yes, exactly. The white box should be our standard modem. Alright, Michael, I'm going to have you do a quick restart. Can you locate the power cable in the back?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. 

Agent: Great. Go ahead and unplug it for me, please.

Customer: Okay... it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds. While we wait, let me just check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) Let me see if there are any outages in your area... I'm not showing any active outages, so that's good news.

Customer: (pause) Okay, thirty seconds is up?

Agent: That should do it. Go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Now we're going to wait for the modem to fully boot up. This usually takes about two to three minutes. You should see the lights start to come back on.

Customer: (pause) Um... okay, so the power light came back on. That's good. But... I'm still not seeing an internet light.

Agent: Okay, no internet light yet. Let's give it another minute or so. Sometimes it takes a bit longer. While we wait, has anything changed recently? Any storms last night, or have you had any work done in your home?

Customer: No, no storms. It was working fine yesterday afternoon. I shut down my computer and when I came back this morning, nothing.

Agent: Understood. (pause) Okay, any lights yet?

Customer: No, still just the power light and... oh wait, there's a light next to it that's blinking red. That's not good, is it?

Agent: A red blinking light... okay. That's actually telling us there might be a signal issue coming into your home. Let me have you check something for me. Can you look at where the cable enters your modem? There should be a coaxial cable. Can you see it?

Customer: Yeah, I see a cable plugged in.

Agent: Okay, can you unplug that cable for me and just visually inspect it? Look for any visible damage, fraying, or anything that looks unusual.

Customer: (pause) Looks... okay to me. It looks normal. Silver connector, nothing weird.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug that back in. (pause) Now let's check something else. Do you have any splitters on your cable line? Maybe before it gets to your modem?

Customer: Um... splitters? I'm not really sure what that is.

Agent: No problem. They're small devices that look kind of like a little black or brass box that the cable goes through. Do you see anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Well, I mean, there's... I see something behind the TV in my living room, but I'm not sure if that's what you mean. It's hard to see back there.

Agent: That could be it. Can you take a look at your office where the modem is? Is there anything between where the cable comes in and where it plugs into the modem?

Customer: No, nothing that I can see. It goes straight from the wall to the modem.

Agent: Okay, that's good actually. Let me check something else on my system. (typing sounds) [inaudible] just... let me regenerate a provisioning signal to your modem real quick. That should take just a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay...

Agent: (pause) Alright, I've sent that through. Can you tell me if anything changes on the modem? Any new lights?

Customer: (long pause) No... still just the power light and that red blinking light.

Agent: Still the red light, huh? Okay. Michael, I'm wondering if we might have an issue with the modem itself or possibly a line issue. Let me try one more thing. Do you have another device you can connect to? Maybe a phone or tablet?

Customer: Oh, um... yeah, I have my phone. But wait, wouldn't that need Wi-Fi? I mean... is the Wi-Fi not working either?

Agent: That's actually a great question. Is your Wi-Fi... do you see a Wi-Fi network available on your phone when you look?

Customer: (pause) Let me check... no, I don't see our usual network at all.

Agent: Okay, so the Wi-Fi isn't broadcasting either. That confirms the modem isn't fully coming online. (pause) Michael, at this point, I think we might need to schedule a technician to come out. This could be a line issue in your neighborhood, or it could be the modem itself needs replacement.

Customer: Really? How long would that take? Like I mentioned, I have these work calls...

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) What does your schedule look like? Can you do today or would tomorrow be better?

Customer: Today would be... I mean, today's pretty packed. Could we do tomorrow morning?

Agent: Let me look... (pause) I'm showing we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that window work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine. I can work around that.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, we'll have a technician check the line at your location and potentially replace the modem if needed. Is there anything else I can help clarify before I get this scheduled?

Customer: No, I think that's... well, I mean, I wish we could've gotten it working today, but... I guess that's just how it goes sometimes, right?

Agent: I really wish we could have too. I apologize we couldn't resolve this remotely. The technician will be able to physically check the line and equipment, so they should be able to get you back up and running. Let me get this appointment locked in. Your appointment is tomorrow, [inaudible]... between 8 and noon. You'll receive a confirmation email and text message shortly with all the details.

Customer: Okay, perfect. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. And again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your patience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
