# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up and running. I work from home and I've got a meeting in like an hour.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. The area code is 206.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I see your account here. So your internet went down this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, around like 8 AM. I was just scrolling through my emails and then everything just... stopped. The whole connection died.

Agent: Alright, let's see what we can do. First thing I'd like to check—can you look at your modem and router for me? Are there any lights on them?

Customer: Uh, yeah, okay. (pause) So I'm looking at the modem right now. I see... there's a red light on it. That's not good, right?

Agent: A red light, okay. That usually indicates there's no connection being detected. Is it the power light or one of the connection lights?

Customer: Um... (pause) it's kind of on the left side. I'm not super technical, so I'm not really sure which one you mean.

Agent: That's totally fine. No worries. So on the modem—there should be a few different lights. One might say "Power," another might say "Internet" or have a globe symbol. Which area of the modem is the red light in?

Customer: Oh, okay, I see the labels now. It says "Internet" and that light is red. The power light is green, so at least that's working.

Agent: Good, good. So your power is on, but that red Internet light tells me the modem isn't receiving a signal from our network. Have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, why don't you go ahead and do that. Just unplug it from the back, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. I'll be right here.

Customer: (sounds of movement, rustling) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) ...thirty seconds... it's been a minute now. Let me plug it back in.

(pause)

Agent: Alright, you plugged it back in?

Customer: Yeah, I did. Now we're waiting for it to boot up, I guess? I'm seeing the lights come back on.

Agent: Perfect. So give it about another minute or so to fully boot up. Just watch and see if that Internet light turns green.

Customer: (pause) Okay... still red. It's still red.

Agent: Still red, okay. Hmm. Let me try a couple more things. Can you check the cables for me? There should be a cable running from the wall outlet to the modem. Can you just verify that's plugged in securely?

Customer: (rustling sounds) Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It looks pretty connected to me.

Agent: Okay, and is it a coaxial cable? It should look kind of thick and metallic.

Customer: Uh, yeah, I think so. Yeah, it's metal and kind of thick.

Agent: Great. And can you give that a little tug, make sure it's in there good and tight?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm pulling on it... feels pretty secure. Although, wait—let me check the other end. The end that goes into the wall. (pause) Oh. Hmm. It looks like it might be a little loose. Let me tighten that up.

Agent: Good catch. Go ahead and tighten that up.

Customer: (grunting sounds, pause) Okay, I got it tightened. Now what?

Agent: Now let's give the modem another minute to see if it recognizes the connection. Just keep an eye on that Internet light.

(longer pause)

Customer: ...Still red. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay. Um, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at our network here to see if we're showing any issues in your area... (pause, longer typing) ...Alright, so on my end, everything appears to be operational in your neighborhood. I'm not seeing any outages reported. That usually means the issue is with the modem or the connection on your end. 

Customer: Okay, so what does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: It's possible, but let me try a few more things before we go down that road. Have you experienced any storms or power surges recently?

Customer: Actually, now that you mention it, there was a pretty bad thunderstorm last night. Really intense. Lightning and everything.

Agent: That might be it. Sometimes a surge from a storm can damage the modem or affect the connection. Let me... let me have you try one more thing. I want you to do what's called a factory reset on the modem. This will clear everything and start fresh.

Customer: Okay. How do I do that?

Agent: So on the back of the modem, there should be a small button labeled "Reset." It might be recessed, so you might need a pen or paperclip to press it. Press and hold it for about ten to fifteen seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm looking for it... I see it. It says "Reset" right here. (sounds of movement) Okay, I'm pressing it with a pen. I'm holding it... ten seconds... fifteen seconds... (pause) Now what?

Agent: Now just let the modem reboot completely. This might take a couple minutes.

(longer pause)

Customer: Okay, it's rebooting. Lights are flashing and everything.

Agent: Perfect. Just give it another minute to stabilize.

(pause)

Customer: So... (pause) ...still red. I don't understand. Shouldn't something have changed by now?

Agent: Yeah, at this point I would have expected to see that Internet light turn green. The fact that it's remaining red even after the reset suggests there might be a deeper issue. It could be a problem with the modem hardware, or there could be an issue with the line coming into your house.

Customer: Oh no. So what do I do?

Agent: I think what we're going to need to do is dispatch a technician to your location. They can do an in-person inspection of the modem and check the line to see if there's a physical issue. Do you have availability coming up in the next few days?

Customer: A technician? How long is that going to take? I need my internet working for my meeting today.

Agent: I understand, and I'm really sorry. Unfortunately, with the troubleshooting we've done, this appears to be a hardware or line issue that requires an on-site visit. Our earliest availability is... (typing sounds) ...looks like we have an opening tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. We can also potentially get someone out the day after.

Customer: Tomorrow? The day after? I need this fixed today.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me see if there's anything else I can try... (pause, typing sounds) Unfortunately, today is pretty booked up with our technician schedule. Is there any way you could reschedule that meeting or use a mobile hotspot for today?

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, I guess I could use my phone as a hotspot. This is just really frustrating. Can you at least put me down for tomorrow during that 1 to 5 window?

Agent: Absolutely. I can get you scheduled for tomorrow. Let me just confirm your address...

Customer: Okay, it's 412 Maple Street, Seattle, 98103.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I have you down for tomorrow, September 15th, between 1 and 5 PM. Our technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive. Is the number we have on file the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Great. I've also put a note in your account about the suspected storm damage and the modem issue. That way the tech will have all this information when they arrive. Unfortunately we weren't able to resolve it over the phone today, and I really do apologize for that. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll get you back up and running. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: Have a good day.
