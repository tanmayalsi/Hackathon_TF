Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I have you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So the internet just stopped working this morning—did anything happen before that? Like a power outage or... did you restart your router at all?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine last night when I went to bed. I woke up this morning and just... nothing. The router's still on—I can see the lights, but no internet.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the router is powered on and you're seeing lights on it. What color are the lights, and are they solid or blinking?

Customer: Um... (pause) there's a green light and then there's like an orange light that's blinking.

Agent: Alright, so the orange blinking light typically indicates a connection issue with our network. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you plugged directly into the router with an ethernet cable, or are you on WiFi?

Customer: I'm on WiFi right now.

Agent: Okay. And have you tried restarting the router yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, let's give that a shot. Go ahead and unplug the power cable from the back of the router, and then just wait about 30 seconds before you plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just going to have you wait those 30 seconds. (pause) You can count it out or just give it a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been about 30 seconds. Plugging it back in now. (pause) Alright, it's booting back up.

Agent: Perfect. It'll take a minute or two to fully restart. While we're waiting, let me check if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) Where are you located, Michael?

Customer: I'm in Boulder, Colorado. On Pearl Street.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, checking now... I'm not showing any active outages in that area. That's good news. How's the router looking?

Customer: (pause) Um, still booting up I think. The lights are doing their thing. Give it another few seconds...

Agent: No problem. Take your time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... the green light is solid now, which is good, but that orange light is still blinking. And I'm still not getting internet on my phone.

Agent: Hmm, okay. The solid green is good—that means power is okay. But that orange blinking usually means the modem isn't connecting to our network properly. Let me try something else. Can you tell me what the model of your router is? It should be on a sticker on the back or the bottom.

Customer: (pause) Let me flip it over... (pause) It says "Frontier model FXC-1600."

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I have that one in the system. Let me check if there's been any recent activity on your account. (pause) Michael, when was the last time you had an issue or reset anything?

Customer: Not recently, no. Like I said, it was working perfectly fine last night.

Agent: Right, got it. Okay, um, let me try a factory reset on the modem from our end. (pause) That might take a minute or two, so just stay on the line with me.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I'm initiating that now. Go ahead and keep an eye on that router. The lights might flicker or go dark for a moment, which is totally normal.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Yeah, I'm seeing the lights kind of dim and... okay, they're coming back on. (pause) But that orange light is still there.

Agent: Still blinking?

Customer: Yeah, still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's... that's strange. Let me check a few more things on the backend here. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any connection issues on our network side. The modem should be registering as connected, but it's not. (pause) Michael, this might be a hardware issue with the modem itself. Have you tried plugging it in with an ethernet cable directly? Just to rule out any WiFi issues?

Customer: Um, I don't have an ethernet cable right here, but... I mean, shouldn't it still connect? Like, even without direct connection?

Agent: You're absolutely right, it should. Let me tell you what I'd like to do. Since we've restarted it and I've reset it from my end and it's still not connecting to the network, this could be a hardware failure with the modem. Do you have an ethernet cable anywhere in your home?

Customer: (pause) I could probably find one. Give me a second. (pause, background noise) Yeah, I found one. What do I do?

Agent: Great. Okay, so go ahead and connect the ethernet cable directly from the router to your computer or laptop. Let me know once it's plugged in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged in. But I don't see anything happening yet.

Agent: Can you check if your computer is recognizing the connection? You should see either a network icon on the taskbar or you could check in your settings.

Customer: (pause) Let me... no, it's not showing anything. I'm not getting internet through the cable either.

Agent: (pause) Okay, Michael, I think at this point we're looking at a modem hardware failure. The device just isn't communicating with our network properly. I've tried everything I can from the backend—the reset, checking for outages, making sure the account is active. Unfortunately, this seems to be a physical problem with the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long is this going to take to fix?

Agent: (pause) What I can do is schedule a technician to come out to your home and either repair or replace the modem. We can typically get someone out within 24 to 48 hours. Or, if you'd prefer, I can have a replacement modem shipped out to you, but that might take 3 to 5 business days depending on shipping.

Customer: (pause) Is there anything else we can try? I really need this working soon. I have work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I completely understand. (pause) Let me try one more thing. Sometimes a full power cycle—where we power everything down together—can help. Have you tried turning off your computer as well and letting everything rest for about five minutes?

Customer: I... I guess not. I've already unplugged the router though.

Agent: Right, but while it's unplugged, go ahead and turn off your computer as well. Then let's wait about five full minutes and restart everything together. The computer first, then plug the router back in about 30 seconds after that powers on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'll try it. Turning off the computer now. (pause) It's off. I'll wait... (long pause) (pause) Okay, it's been about five minutes. Turning the computer back on... (pause, background noise) Okay, it's booting up. Now let me plug the router back in. (pause) Plugged in.

Agent: Good. Let's give it another couple minutes to fully boot up and establish connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) No, Derek, I'm still not seeing anything. Same orange blinking light.

Agent: (pause) I'm sorry, Michael. I think we've exhausted the troubleshooting steps. This really does appear to be a hardware issue on the modem's end. The fact that it's not connecting even with the factory reset and the direct ethernet connection tells me the device isn't functioning properly.

Customer: (pause) Man, okay. So what's my fastest option here?

Agent: Your fastest option would be to have a technician come to your home. I can get you scheduled for tomorrow if there's availability in your area. Otherwise, the replacement ship-out is the next option, but that's going to be slower.

Customer: How much is that going to cost me?

Agent: (typing sounds) The technician visit and modem replacement is covered under your service plan, so there's no additional charge for that. You're all set there.

Customer: (pause) Okay, well... I guess schedule the technician for tomorrow then. What time works?

Agent: Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm showing we have a window available tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM in your area. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works. I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, you're all scheduled. The confirmation number is 7734-Q. Can I get a phone number where we can reach you if the technician needs to confirm?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as my account number.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone, Michael. The technician will be able to diagnose and fix this properly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying anyway, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for being patient with us, and we apologize for the inconvenience. You should get your internet back up and running tomorrow. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, Michael.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
