Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I work from home and I really need to get this figured out.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that, sir. I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're in the Riverside area on our fiber service. And you're saying your internet went down this morning?

Customer: Yeah, around 8 AM. One minute it was working fine and then it just... nothing. No lights on the modem, nothing.

Agent: Alright, let me start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what you're seeing on your modem right now? Are there any lights on it at all?

Customer: No lights. It's completely dark.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The modem might have lost power. Can you check the power cable for me? Is it plugged into the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's plugged in. Let me... actually, hold on. Let me check the outlet. (brief pause) The outlet feels fine and, um, yeah, the cable is definitely connected.

Agent: Good. Alright, let's try a power cycle. Can you unplug the modem from the wall outlet for me?

Customer: Sure, unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. While we're waiting, let me just verify a couple of things. Have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, this is the first time. It's been pretty reliable up until now.

Agent: That's good to know. Okay, go ahead and wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Alright... plugging it back in... (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now, what we're looking for is the lights on the front of the modem. We should see a power light come on first, usually within a few seconds. Then the internet light should start blinking. Do you see that?

Customer: Um... (pause) The power light came on, so that's something. But the internet light isn't doing anything. It's not even lighting up.

Agent: It's not lighting up at all?

Customer: Nope, nothing. Just the power light.

Agent: Okay, that tells me the modem is getting power but it's not syncing to the network. Let me check on our end real quick. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any service issues in your area currently. Let me look at your modem connection status... Hmm, it's showing as offline on our system too.

Customer: What does that mean? Is it the modem itself that's broken?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It might be an issue with the modem, or it could be a line issue on our end. Let me try one more thing. Do you have access to the back of the modem? Can you see the cable connection?

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (pause) Okay, I can see it. The cable's connected to the back.

Agent: Alright, I'm going to have you try something. Can you unplug that cable from the back of the modem and plug it back in?

Customer: (pause) Okay, doing that now... (pause) Alright, cable's back in.

Agent: Good. Now let's give it another thirty seconds or so and see if that internet light comes on.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Still nothing. Just that power light.

Agent: (sigh) Alright. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm going to reboot your modem from here. This might take a minute or two.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, the reboot has been initiated. Why don't we give it about two minutes and see if we get the internet light to come on?

Customer: How long is this going to take? I really need to get back to work here.

Agent: I completely understand. We're doing everything we can. The reboot should take just a couple of minutes. While we wait, let me ask you—have you noticed anything unusual? Any storms in your area, construction work nearby, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine all morning.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Let's check in on that modem. Do you see any change in the lights at all?

Customer: (pause) The power light is still on, but... no internet light. Still nothing.

Agent: (pause) I'm not seeing your modem sync to the network on our end either, unfortunately. This is concerning. Let me escalate this to our technical team. Can you hold for just one moment while I see what options we have available?

Customer: Yeah, sure. How long is this going to be?

Agent: Just a quick minute, sir.

Customer: Okay.

(hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So I've reviewed your account and the service connection on our end, and unfortunately, I'm not able to get your modem to come online from here. There are a few possibilities—it could be that the modem itself has failed, or there could be an issue with the line coming into your home that I'm unable to diagnose remotely.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: I think at this point, we're going to need to get a technician out to your location to do an in-person evaluation. They can check both the modem and the line connection to determine what the issue is.

Customer: How soon can someone come out? Like, today?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) We do have availability today, but the earliest window I'm showing is between 1 PM and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: I mean... I guess it has to, right? But that's still several hours away.

Agent: I know it's not ideal. I apologize for the inconvenience. The technician will be able to come out and resolve this, whether it's a modem replacement or a line issue. 

Customer: And you can't do anything else right now? Like, I'm dead in the water here.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Unfortunately, I've exhausted the remote troubleshooting steps we can do. We're not seeing any network-side issues, so the problem is either with your equipment or the physical connection to your home, and those require an on-site visit.

Customer: (sigh) Alright. So I'm scheduled for between 1 and 5?

Agent: Yes, sir. And I can text you a confirmation with the details. Do you want me to proceed with scheduling that appointment?

Customer: Yeah, go ahead. What's the number again?

Agent: I'll send that to the number we have on file, which shows as—

Customer: —no, wait, can you send it to my cell? 555-0198.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm updating that now. You should receive a text confirmation within the next few minutes with the appointment details. A technician will arrive sometime between 1 PM and 5 PM today.

Customer: Alright. And they'll be able to fix this?

Agent: They'll diagnose the issue and get you back online. If it's the modem, they can replace it. If there's a line issue, they'll repair that as well.

Customer: Okay. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: I do apologize that we weren't able to resolve this over the phone. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, sir. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your patience. Someone will be out to you today.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: Have a good day.
