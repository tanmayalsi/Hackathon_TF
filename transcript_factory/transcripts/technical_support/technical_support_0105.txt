Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've already tried unplugging the modem and router, but nothing's working.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm seeing your account here under... Robert Martinez?

Customer: That's right, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned you've already tried unplugging the modem and router. When exactly did you notice the internet went down?

Customer: Like I said, about an hour ago. I was working from home and everything just... stopped. One second it was fine, the next second nothing.

Agent: Okay. And just to confirm, you're not seeing any lights on the modem at all, or are there lights but they're not doing what they normally do?

Customer: There are lights. The power light is on, but like... I think the internet light? It's not on. It's usually blue and it's just... dark.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful. So the power is definitely on but we're not seeing an internet connection light. Have you had any storms in your area recently, or any construction work happening nearby?

Customer: No storms that I know of. It's been pretty clear all day actually. And no, no construction. It's just a regular suburban area here.

Agent: Got it. Well, let me have you try a couple of things for me, okay? First, can you unplug the modem again, but this time keep it unplugged for about 30 seconds? Count it out if you need to.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) One... two... three... (pause) Alright, it's been about 30 seconds. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (background noise of plugging in device) Okay, plugged back in.

Agent: Great. Now while that's booting up, let me ask you... when you're looking at the modem, is it the white box with the Frontier logo on it?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And, uh... (pause) the lights are starting to come back on. The power light's definitely on. I'm seeing... green lights, I think?

Agent: Okay, good. Those are coming up. Now just give it about another minute or two to fully boot up. While we're waiting, can you tell me if you've noticed any changes to your setup recently? New equipment, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. Everything's been the same for... I don't know, like six months now? Longer maybe.

Agent: (pause) Alright, Robert. How are those lights looking now?

Customer: Um... okay so the power light is solid now. I'm seeing some green. But that internet light... I'm still not seeing it come on.

Agent: Still not coming on? Okay. Let me try something else. Can you check the cables for me? Are they all plugged in securely? There should be cables running to the modem.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. There's like... one cable from the wall and then... (pause) okay, I see two cables. They both look plugged in pretty tight to me. They're not loose or anything.

Agent: Good. And the cable coming from the wall, it's plugged into the port labeled "Internet" or maybe "WAN"? It should be different from the other ports.

Customer: (pause) Uh... let me see here. It's... yeah, it's in like the single port that's kind of off by itself. I think that's the right one.

Agent: Perfect, that's the correct port. Okay, so what I'd like to try now is to check if there are any outages in your area. Let me look that up. (typing sounds) Can you give me your service address, just to double-check?

Customer: 2847 Maple Drive, Springdale.

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) Okay, 2847 Maple Drive. (pause) Alright, I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area currently. So it's likely something with the equipment or the line itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is there something else I can try?

Agent: Well, let me have you try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem again and also unplug the router if you have one? Let's do a full reset.

Customer: Okay, unplugging the modem... and the router. They're both unplugged now.

Agent: And just like before, wait about 30 seconds with both of them unplugged.

Customer: (pause) Alright, 30 seconds... counting... (pause) Okay, it's been 30 seconds.

Agent: Go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (background noise) Plugging it in now.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about a minute for that to fully boot, and then we'll plug the router in.

Customer: (pause, longer pause) Okay... I'm seeing the lights come back on. Power's solid. I'm still seeing some green lights, but that internet connection light... (trailing off) ...it's still not there.

Agent: It's still not coming on?

Customer: No, it's not.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Can you go ahead and plug the router in now?

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, plugging it back in.

Agent: [inaudible] alright. You know, Robert, I'm wondering if we might be dealing with a line issue on our end. Sometimes the signal just stops coming down the line and a reset won't fix that. 

Customer: So what does that mean? How do we fix it?

Agent: Well, typically we'd need to send a technician out to check the line. Before we do that though, let me just... (pause, typing sounds) ...let me try one more thing. I'm going to restart your connection from our end here. Give me just a moment.

Customer: Okay, I'm waiting.

Agent: (pause, longer pause) Alright, that's been restarted. Do you see any changes on your modem at all?

Customer: Uh... (pause) No. It's the same thing. The internet light's still off.

Agent: (sigh) Yeah, unfortunately I think we're past the point where we can troubleshoot this over the phone. I don't want to waste any more of your time with attempted fixes if there's an actual line issue here. I'm going to need to get a technician scheduled to come out and check your connection.

Customer: Really? How long is that going to take?

Agent: Let me check availability. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: (frustrated) Tomorrow morning would be... fine, I guess. I need this working because I work from home. This is pretty frustrating.

Agent: I totally understand, and I apologize for this inconvenience. We'll get someone out there tomorrow morning to figure out what's going on. They'll be able to test the line and either fix it on the spot or order new equipment if needed.

Customer: Alright. What else do I need to do?

Agent: Just keep everything as it is. Leave the modem and router plugged in and don't touch them until the technician gets there. They'll do a full diagnosis when they arrive. I'm going to send you a confirmation to the email on file, and you should have that within the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I got it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, Robert. Again, I'm sorry about this. Is there anything else I can help you with before we finish up today?

Customer: No, that's it. I'll see the technician tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll get your internet back up and running as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
