Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back on. I've tried restarting the modem and everything, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll definitely get this sorted out for you. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account here for... is this in the name of James Patterson?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned the internet went out about an hour ago. And you've already tried restarting the modem—that's great. Have you checked to see if the modem is showing any lights right now? Any activity on it at all?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) Yeah, so the power light is on, that's green. But the internet light—the one that usually blinks—that's not doing anything. It's just... dark.

Agent: Okay, so we've got power but no internet signal. That's helpful information. What I'd like to do is walk you through a few more troubleshooting steps, if that's alright?

Customer: Yeah, sure, go ahead.

Agent: Great. So first, can you tell me—do you have the modem router combo unit, or do you have a separate modem and router?

Customer: I think it's all in one? It's just the one box.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so what I need you to do is look at the back of the unit and tell me if all the cables are plugged in securely. Check the power cable, and then also the coaxial cable—that's the cable that comes from the wall.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at the back... yeah, the power cable looks good. And the other cable, the one from the wall, that's... (pause) ...that seems like it's in pretty tight too.

Agent: Good. And just to be thorough, is there any chance your service was interrupted or anything like that? Sometimes if there's been bad weather or construction in your area...

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine this morning and then boom—just died.

Agent: I understand. Okay, so here's what I'd like you to try next. I want you to unplug the modem from the power outlet completely. Hold on for about thirty seconds—

Customer: Thirty seconds?

Agent: Yes, just so the system can fully power down. Then plug it back in and let's see if that helps reset the connection.

Customer: Alright, I'm unplugging it now. (background noise) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. And just waiting... (pause) ...I'll wait with you here.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been like thirty seconds. I'm plugging it back in... (pause) ...and it's powering up again.

Agent: Great. Now let's watch those lights. Once it boots up completely, the power light should come back on green, and then we should see activity on the internet light. How does it look?

Customer: (pause) The power light is green again, yeah. But the internet light... still nothing. It's still off.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Still not showing. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any service interruptions in your area, so that's good news. Let me just verify—when the internet light doesn't come on, does it stay completely dark, or is it showing any color at all? Red, amber, anything?

Customer: No, it's just completely dark. Like, totally off.

Agent: I see. Okay, let me try something else. On the front of the unit, you should see a reset button. It's usually a small recessed button. Do you see that?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I see it. That's like... if I press that, won't that reset everything? Like my Wi-Fi password and all that?

Agent: It will reset your settings, yes, but at this point we need to get your connection back up and running. You can always update your password afterward. Do you want to go ahead and give that a try?

Customer: (hesitant) Yeah, I guess. If we have to... How long do I hold it?

Agent: For about ten to fifteen seconds. You might need a pen or a paperclip since it's recessed.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm gonna grab something... (background noise) Alright, I found a paperclip. Pressing in three, two, one... (pause) ...okay, I'm holding it. (pause) Still holding... (pause) ...and releasing. Did that do anything?

Agent: Let's wait just a moment for it to reboot. (pause) How are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) The power light is green again, but the internet light... still dark. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Alright. (pause) This is unusual. Let me check the signal coming into your area. (typing sounds) [inaudible] ...one moment please...

Customer: Is everything okay?

Agent: I'm just checking our network status here. Sometimes there can be an issue with the line coming into your home that we wouldn't necessarily see on our end immediately. Have you tried connecting a computer directly to the modem with an ethernet cable? Just to rule out the Wi-Fi?

Customer: I... I don't think I have an ethernet cable. Why, does that matter?

Agent: It can help us determine if it's a Wi-Fi issue or a broader connection issue. But if you don't have one handy, that's okay. Let me try a few more things. Are you still seeing that dark internet light?

Customer: Yeah, still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Okay, and just to confirm—you haven't made any recent changes to your modem? Moved it, updated anything...?

Customer: No, nothing. It's been in the same spot for like six months.

Agent: Right. (pause) I'm looking at everything I can access, and I'm not showing a service outage or any account issues on our end. Given that the modem isn't establishing a signal even after the reset, I think what we're dealing with here is either a modem hardware failure or potentially an issue with the line coming into your home.

Customer: (frustrated) So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Unfortunately, those are things we'd need to have a technician come out to diagnose in person. We can definitely schedule that for you, but I want to be upfront—we'd be looking at a service appointment, probably sometime in the next two to three business days depending on availability.

Customer: Two or three days? Can't you troubleshoot it any further right now?

Agent: (pause) I've walked through the standard reset procedures, verified there are no service outages in your area, and confirmed your account is active. Without an ethernet connection to test, or the ability for me to run a remote diagnostic—which our modem doesn't support—I really can't determine the exact issue from here. I wish I could do more.

Customer: (sighs) Okay... okay, so I need a technician.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone. But yes, scheduling a service call would be the next step. I can get you set up right now if you'd like. Are you available during the day typically?

Customer: Yeah, I work from home normally, so... (pause) ...yeah, any day works.

Agent: Great. Let me get some dates and times available for you.
