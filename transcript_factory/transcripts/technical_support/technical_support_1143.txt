Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. Account for James Mitchell at 412 Oakmont Drive, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Alright, James. So your internet's been down since this morning. Have you tried restarting your modem and router yet?

Customer: Um... I restarted the modem, but I'm not sure about the router. Where is that?

Agent: Okay, no problem. The router is usually a separate box, kind of rectangular shaped, might have antennas on it. Does that sound familiar?

Customer: Oh yeah, I see it. It's right next to the modem.

Agent: Perfect. So let's go ahead and restart that as well. Can you unplug it for me and wait about 30 seconds?

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now... (another pause) Alright, I'm waiting.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Yeah, it's back in. The lights are... they're lighting up now.

Agent: Excellent. Give it just another minute or so to fully boot up. While we're waiting, have you noticed any blinking lights on your modem? Like, is there a red light or an orange light at all?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) Yeah, actually, there's an orange light. Is that bad?

Agent: An orange light can mean a few different things. It could just be the modem initializing. Let's wait another moment here. (pause) Okay, is it still orange?

Customer: Yeah, still orange.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else. Can you check if all the cables going into the modem are plugged in securely? There should be a power cable and then a couple of network cables.

Customer: (pause) Let me check... Okay, yeah, they all look pretty secure to me. Wait, this one... (sound of adjusting) I'm gonna push it in a little more. Does that help?

Agent: That might actually help. Let's give it a few seconds to recognize the connection. Is that orange light still there?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... it's still orange.

Agent: Okay. And when you try to connect to the internet on your computer or phone, what happens? Can you see your wifi network?

Customer: Yeah, I can see the network. I'm connected to it, but like, nothing's loading. I tried to open a web page and it just keeps spinning.

Agent: Right, so you're connected to the network but there's no internet access. That's helpful information. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) When did you last have a working connection?

Customer: It was working fine yesterday. I shut everything down last night like normal, and when I turned it on this morning, nothing.

Agent: Got it. And there haven't been any storms or anything like that in your area recently?

Customer: No, not that I'm aware of. The weather's been nice actually.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Let me try one more thing with you. Can you restart your modem one more time, but this time hold the restart button on the back for about 10 seconds?

Customer: Oh, um, the restart button? Is that different from just unplugging it?

Agent: Yeah, good question. The restart button will do a soft reset. It'll keep your settings in place. Can you find a small button on the back of the modem? You might need a pen or something to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. I'm gonna press it now. (pause) I'm holding it... (another pause) Okay, releasing it.

Agent: Good. Now we're gonna give it about two minutes to fully restart. Let me put you on a brief hold while we wait.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (hold music for approximately 90 seconds)

Agent: Alright, I'm back. Are you still there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Has the light on your modem changed at all?

Customer: (pause) Um, no. It's still orange. Or maybe it's a little more yellow now? I'm not totally sure.

Agent: Okay. And you still don't have internet access?

Customer: No, nothing. Still can't load anything.

Agent: Alright, let me check our system here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area, so that's good news and bad news, right? But it does mean this might be something specific to your equipment. Let me see... (pause) Have you had any recent power outages or anything like that?

Customer: Not that I noticed. I mean, the power's been on the whole time.

Agent: Right. And you mentioned you've got work you need to do. How urgent is that?

Customer: Pretty urgent, yeah. I've got some deliverables due today that I need to upload.

Agent: I understand. Okay, so here's where we are. Based on what we've tried, I'm seeing a few possibilities. It could be that the modem itself has gone bad, or there could be an issue with the line coming into your house. There might also be something happening at our end.

Customer: So... what does that mean?

Agent: Well, unfortunately, I'm not able to resolve this over the phone right now. What I'd like to do is schedule a technician visit for you. We can usually get someone out within 24 to 48 hours. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sigh) I mean, I guess it'll have to. But is there anything else we can try right now?

Agent: (pause) Let me think... Um, one last thing. Can you try accessing the modem's admin panel? Do you know how to do that?

Customer: No, I have no idea how to do that.

Agent: Okay, that's alright. You'd go to your browser and type in 192.168.0.1, but honestly, that might not help us at this point. I think our best bet really is getting a technician out there. They'll have better tools to diagnose what's going on.

Customer: Yeah, okay. When can you get someone out here?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability. We have some openings tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM, or Wednesday morning. Which works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow's better. What time would they come?

Agent: I can set you up for tomorrow, and the window would be between 8 AM and 5 PM. The technician will call you about an hour before they arrive to narrow down the time. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. I'll make sure I'm home.

Agent: Perfect. I've got that scheduled for you. Your reference number is FRN-447829. Can you write that down?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I got it. FRN-447829.

Agent: Great. So just to recap, you've got a technician visit tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM. They'll call you before they come. In the meantime, if anything changes or if it suddenly starts working, just give us a call back and we can cancel the appointment.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. And is there... I mean, will I be charged for this visit?

Agent: Since we haven't been able to resolve this over the phone and it could be equipment-related, the first diagnostic visit is typically covered. If it turns out to be something we need to repair or replace, we'll talk about next steps with you then.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Again, I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved today. We'll get you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
