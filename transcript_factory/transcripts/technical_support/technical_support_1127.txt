Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went out completely. Like, I have no connection at all. I've been without it for about an hour now and I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I grab your account number real quick? It should be on your bill or modem.

Customer: Yeah, one second. (pause) Okay, it's 7-4-9-2-8-5-1.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thanks. So I'm showing your account here under the name... Robert Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. And you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago?

Customer: Yeah, roughly an hour. Everything was fine this morning and then I was just trying to work from home and nothing. The modem's still lit up and everything, but there's no actual internet connection.

Agent: Okay, okay. Let me pull up your service status here. (pause) So I'm not seeing any outages in your area currently, which is good news. That usually means it's something we can troubleshoot on your end. First thing I want you to do is take a look at your modem for me. Can you see the lights on the front?

Customer: Yeah, the lights are on. There's like... a blue light that's solid, and then there's a couple other lights that are blinking.

Agent: Okay, perfect. Which lights are blinking? Is it the internet light?

Customer: Uh, I think so? There's one that says like "internet" or something, and it's blinking. And then there's another one that's blinking too.

Agent: Alright, so when the internet light is blinking like that, usually it means the modem is trying to establish a connection with our network but it's having trouble connecting. What I want you to do is unplug the power cable from the back of the modem. Just pull it out completely.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Done.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds. I know it feels like a long time, but just... give it a half minute and then we'll plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, plugged back in. (pause) Okay, so the lights are coming back on. They're all flashing right now.

Agent: That's normal. That's the modem restarting and connecting to the network. Can you keep an eye on those lights for me? We're looking for that internet light to stop blinking and become solid blue.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so it's still blinking. We're like a minute in now.

Agent: Yeah, it can take a couple minutes sometimes. Let's give it another minute or so.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, still blinking. It's been like two minutes now.

Agent: (pause) Okay, um, let me ask you a couple more questions. Do you have a router, or are you connecting directly to the modem?

Customer: I have a router, yeah. It's connected to the modem.

Agent: Okay. And what lights are showing on your router right now?

Customer: The router... it's dark. Like, no lights on it at all.

Agent: No lights? Okay, can you check the power cable on the router? Make sure it's plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Oh, hmm. Yeah, it is plugged in. Let me try unplugging it and plugging it back in.

Agent: Good idea.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged back in. Nothing. Still no lights.

Agent: Alright. And on the modem end, is the cable that goes from the modem to the router... can you see that it's plugged in securely on both ends?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It looks pretty secure to me.

Agent: Okay. Can you try unplugging that cable from the modem and then plugging it back in?

Customer: (pause) Okay, done. Still nothing though. The router's still dark.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, well, let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any issues flagged on your line. Let me ask you... when you say the modem has lights, can you describe all the lights you see right now? What colors are they?

Customer: Um, okay. So I see a blue one that's solid now, actually. That one stopped blinking. Then there's a red light that's... it's like flickering on and off. And then there's a couple others that aren't lit up.

Agent: Okay, so the blue light is solid now. That's good—that means you should have connection. But the red light is concerning. A red light typically indicates an error. Can you tell me which red light it is? Like, what does it say next to it?

Customer: It just says, like, a little symbol. I don't think it has a label. It's the one closest to the bottom.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I want to try one more thing. Can you do a hard reset of the modem? There should be a small reset button on the back. You might need a paperclip.

Customer: A reset button? (pause) Yeah, I see it. You want me to hold it down?

Agent: Yeah, press and hold it for about ten seconds. That should do a full reset of the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... (pause) Alright, let go. (pause) The modem's restarting. All the lights are flashing again.

Agent: Good. Now we're going to let it boot back up fully. This might take a couple of minutes.

Customer: (pause) Okay, we're waiting. (pause) Still waiting. (pause) Alright, so... the blue light is solid again, but that red light is back too.

Agent: (sigh) Okay, um... (pause) Robert, I'm going to be honest with you. That red light suggests there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or potentially an issue with the line coming into your house. I'm not able to fully diagnose that over the phone.

Customer: Oh, man. So what does that mean?

Agent: What I'd recommend is we schedule a technician to come out and take a look at your setup. They can check the line, the modem, all the connections, and get you back up and running. Do you have availability this week?

Customer: Yeah, I mean... I need this fixed pretty soon. I work from home, so this is kind of a big deal.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) I can get a technician out to you tomorrow between 2 and 5 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Tomorrow? Yeah, that works. I just need this fixed.

Agent: Okay, perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. You're going to receive a confirmation email, and the technician will give you a call about thirty minutes before they arrive. Is the number on the account still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. And just as a final troubleshooting step before they come out, make sure everything is unplugged and then we'll have the tech handle it from there. They'll have the proper equipment to diagnose what's going on.

Customer: Alright. So tomorrow, 2 to 5.

Agent: That's correct. I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today, Robert. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying.

Agent: You're welcome. Again, sorry for the inconvenience. You have a great rest of your day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
