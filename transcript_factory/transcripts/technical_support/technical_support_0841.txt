# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, so my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home today.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... hold on, let me find it. (rustling sounds) Okay, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. And just to confirm, this is regarding your fiber internet service?

Customer: Yeah, the fiber. Like, there's nothing. No internet at all. The modem's lights are all weird too.

Agent: Okay, got it. So the modem lights are acting strange. Can you describe that for me? Like, which lights are on or off?

Customer: Um, there's the power light, and that one's on, it's like white or whatever. But the other ones... I think the internet light is red? Or maybe it's off, I don't know. (pause) I'm not super tech-savvy.

Agent: No, that's totally fine. Red light on the internet indicator usually means there's a connection issue. Have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in yet?

Customer: No, not yet. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Go ahead and do that for me, and then we'll wait about thirty seconds for it to boot back up.

Customer: (background noise of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) ...Waiting. (longer pause) Should it be making that noise? It's like beeping or something.

Agent: That's normal, that's just part of the startup sequence. Just give it another ten, fifteen seconds or so.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... (pause) ...the lights are coming back on. The power one's definitely on, and... oh, okay, the internet one is like, amber now? Or yellow?

Agent: Amber, okay. That usually means it's trying to connect. Let's give it maybe another minute or so. Sometimes it takes a little while to re-establish the connection. Are you seeing any changes?

Customer: (pause) Uh... still amber. How long should this take?

Agent: It shouldn't take much longer. Can you give it about... let's say another thirty seconds?

Customer: (pause) ...Still amber. It's been like a minute and a half now.

Agent: Okay, that's... that's a little longer than ideal. Let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) Hmm. I'm actually not seeing any service interruptions in your area, so that's good news. But let me see if there's an issue with your account specifically.

Customer: Okay, what does that mean?

Agent: It could be a few things. Sometimes the modem just needs to fully sync with our network. But I'm also gonna ask you to try something else. Can you check the cables going into the modem? Make sure they're all plugged in nice and tight?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. There's like three cables, right? One's the power, and then there's... (pause) ...wait, one of them is kind of loose.

Agent: Oh! Okay, try pushing that one in all the way.

Customer: (fumbling sounds) Okay, it's... it's in. (pause) Hmm. Still amber though.

Agent: Alright. And this loose cable, was it the one that goes to the wall jack or was it something different?

Customer: I'm not sure. It's just going into the modem. There's a white cable going into the wall in the corner over there.

Agent: Okay, so you've got the ethernet cable going into the modem, and you've also got... let me make sure I'm visualizing this right. You've got coax cable coming from the wall outlet, correct?

Customer: I think so? Yeah, there's definitely something coming from the wall.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so here's what I want you to try. Can you unplug the coax cable from the modem—that's the one that comes from the wall—and then plug it back in?

Customer: (pause) The one from the wall? (pause) Okay, I got it. (unplugging sounds) Plugging it back in... (pause) done.

Agent: Great. Give it another minute to reconnect.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... still amber. (pause) This is frustrating. I really need this working.

Agent: I totally understand. I know this is annoying. Let me check something on my backend here. (typing sounds, longer pause) 

Customer: ...Still here.

Agent: Yeah, yeah, I'm just pulling up some diagnostics. (pause) Okay, so I'm actually seeing that there might be a line issue on our end. I'm not getting a solid signal from your modem to our network.

Customer: What does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: So that would typically mean there's either a break in the line somewhere between our network box and your house, or there could be an issue with the equipment itself. Um, I can definitely set up a technician visit to come out and take a look, but before we do that, I want to try one more thing.

Customer: Okay, what is it?

Agent: I'm going to power cycle your modem from my end. You should see the lights go off in the next few seconds, and then they'll boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, they just went off. (pause) ...They're coming back on. (longer pause) Power light's on, the internet one is... (pause) ...still amber.

Agent: [inaudible] Still amber. Okay. (pause) Unfortunately, I'm still not seeing that solid connection come through. I think at this point, we're probably looking at something that needs to be checked out in person.

Customer: So you can't fix it from there?

Agent: Not with what I'm seeing, no. It looks like it could be a physical line issue, which would need a technician to diagnose. But here's the good news—I can get someone out there pretty quickly. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) 

Customer: How long are we talking?

Agent: Alright, so I've got an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or I can do Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning works. I'll make it work.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get all your information here and get that scheduled. (typing sounds) Okay, so that's... address is still... (pause) ...got it. Is the phone number 555-0148?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So I have a technician scheduled to come by tomorrow between 8 and noon. His name will be Marcus. He'll call you about fifteen minutes before he arrives. In the meantime, just to be safe, I'd recommend keeping the modem unplugged. That way there's no power surge or anything if there is a line issue.

Customer: Okay, I'll do that. So... is there anything I should try tonight or anything?

Agent: No, I think we've done pretty much everything we can from here. It's looking like a physical line issue, so the tech will be able to figure it out tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Well, not really "it" since my internet's down, but... you know what I mean.

Agent: (laughs) Yeah, I hear you. Well, I really appreciate your patience today, and we'll get you back up and running tomorrow. Your confirmation number is 447829. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You got it. Thank you so much for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
