# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So my internet just went out completely. I've been without service for like, I don't know, maybe twenty minutes now? And I really need to get it back up.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get this sorted out. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account here under... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing a complete outage with no internet connection at all?

Customer: Right, nothing. My WiFi's not working, the lights on the modem aren't doing anything either. It's completely dead.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful to know. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First thing I want you to do is locate your modem. It should be a white or black box, usually has some lights on the front. Do you see it?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's just... nothing. No lights at all.

Agent: Alright, so no lights whatsoever. That typically means there's a power issue. I want you to check the power cable in the back of the modem and make sure it's plugged in all the way.

Customer: (pause) Let me... yeah, it's plugged in. The cord looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay, good. Now, can you follow the cord back to the outlet and just verify that the outlet itself has power? Sometimes another device in the house might have tripped a breaker.

Customer: (sound of movement) Uh, the outlet... let me check. I'll plug my phone charger in here really quick. (pause) Oh, okay, so the outlet does have power. The phone charger's getting charged.

Agent: That's good news. So the outlet works. Now, what I'd like you to do is unplug the modem completely for about thirty seconds. Just pull it straight out.

Customer: Got it. (sound of unplugging) It's out.

Agent: Perfect. While we're waiting those thirty seconds, let me ask—have there been any recent storms in your area? Any power outages or weather issues?

Customer: Hmm, there was some heavy rain last night, actually. But I didn't lose power in the house or anything.

Agent: Okay, that's good to note. Sometimes that can affect things, though. Go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay, it's in. (pause) ...I'm waiting for lights...

Agent: (pause) How long has it been?

Customer: Maybe ten seconds? Still nothing. This doesn't look good.

Agent: Let's give it about twenty more seconds. The modem can take a minute to fully power on sometimes.

Customer: (longer pause) Alright... it's been about thirty seconds now, and... nope. Still completely dark. No lights at all.

Agent: Okay. That's unusual. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area currently, and your account shows that your service should be active.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It might be an issue with the modem itself, or there could be something with the line coming into your house. Let me ask you this—do you have a gateway or router separate from the modem?

Customer: Um, I don't think so? Just the one modem box.

Agent: Alright, that's the equipment we provided then. Okay, I want to try one more thing. Can you look on the back of the modem and tell me if there's a small reset button?

Customer: (sound of movement) Yeah, I see it. It's tiny, like a little pinhole.

Agent: That's the one. I'm going to have you press and hold that for about ten seconds. You might need a paperclip or something thin to press it. That'll reset the device to factory settings.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause, rustling sounds) Got a paperclip. (pause) Pushing it in... and I'll hold it... one, two, three... (pause) ...ten seconds. Okay, I'm releasing it.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait and see if the lights come back on.

Customer: (longer pause) ...No. Still nothing. This is really not working.

Agent: I know, I'm sorry. This is frustrating. Unfortunately, if the modem isn't powering on at all after a reset, it's likely a hardware failure with the equipment itself.

Customer: So what do I do about that?

Agent: Well, we have a few options here. I can schedule a technician to come out and either repair the modem or replace it with a new unit. That's typically our best option when we're seeing a complete power failure like this.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what availability we have... When would work best for you? We have morning and afternoon appointments available.

Customer: Tomorrow? Can someone come out tomorrow?

Agent: Tomorrow... (pause, typing) I'm showing we have an opening tomorrow between 1 and 4 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works for me. I'll be here.

Agent: Okay, excellent. Let me get your information for the technician. Is 555-0147 still the best number to reach you at?

Customer: That's correct.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, Robert, I'm getting you all set up. The technician will arrive tomorrow between 1 and 4 PM. They'll have a replacement modem with them, or they can try to diagnose the issue on-site.

Customer: Okay. So just to confirm—there's nothing else I can try right now?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. At this point, with no lights on the modem at all and it not responding to a power cycle or reset, it's definitely a hardware issue that needs to be handled by our tech team.

Customer: Alright. I guess I'll just have to wait until tomorrow then.

Agent: I'm really sorry about this, Robert. I know it's inconvenient. Is there anything else I can help you with while I have you on the line?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... make sure that technician shows up, okay?

Agent: Absolutely. They'll be there. We'll also be sending you a confirmation email and text message with all the appointment details. If you need to reschedule for any reason, you can call us back or reschedule online through your account.

Customer: Got it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: Thank you for your patience today, Robert. We really appreciate your business, and I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved remotely. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
