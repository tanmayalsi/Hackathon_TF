Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm really frustrated. I need it back up ASAP.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm pulling up your account now. And your name is...?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Great, David. I see here you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Riverside area. So when you say the internet has been down since this morning, did you notice any warning signs first, or did it just suddenly stop working?

Customer: It just... yeah, it just went out. One minute everything was fine, I was working from home, and the next thing I know, boom, nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Okay. And right now, when you look at your modem and router, what lights are you seeing? Are they on, off, blinking...?

Customer: (pause) Um, let me look... So the modem has a red light on top, and the router next to it, I don't... I don't think any lights are on on that one.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The red light on the modem typically indicates there's no connection. Let's try a few basic troubleshooting steps. First, can you unplug the modem for about thirty seconds and then plug it back in?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, unplugging it now.

(background noise of unplugging)

Customer: Alright, it's unplugged. I'm gonna wait the thirty seconds... (longer pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

(sounds of plugging in, beeping)

Customer: There's some beeping... lights are doing stuff now. There's a green light and an orange light.

Agent: That's good, that's normal. When it powers back up, it usually takes about two to three minutes to fully boot. Give it a moment and those lights should stabilize. While we wait, did you happen to have any weather issues last night or this morning? Sometimes weather can affect the fiber connection.

Customer: (pause) You know, now that you mention it, we did have a pretty bad storm last night. Power went out for like an hour.

Agent: Ah, that could definitely be related. The power surge from a storm can sometimes cause issues with the modem or the connection itself. Okay, let's give it another minute or so. Why don't you try connecting a device—maybe your laptop or phone—to the WiFi and see if you're getting any connection?

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me grab my laptop... Nope. Still nothing. The WiFi network isn't even showing up.

Agent: Alright. Let's try unplugging the router as well. Sometimes they need to be reset together.

Customer: (sighs) Okay...

(pause and background noise)

Customer: Alright, router's unplugged too.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and wait thirty seconds on that one as well, and then plug it back in.

(pause)

Customer: (longer pause) Okay, plugging it back in... (sounds of beeping) Still seeing the same lights on the modem though.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Can you tell me what color lights you're seeing on the modem now? And are any of them blinking or are they solid?

Customer: There's a solid green light, an orange light that's blinking, and... (pause) ...a red light in the corner.

Agent: The blinking orange light means the modem is trying to sync with the network. That should stabilize in a moment, but the red light is concerning. Let me just check something on your account here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, so it's likely an issue with your modem specifically or possibly the connection coming into your home.

Customer: Oh, great. So what do I do?

Agent: Let me ask you a few questions. Have you noticed any burning smells or anything unusual near the modem?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's fine.

Agent: Okay, good. Can you check—is there a reset button on the back of the modem? It might be small and recessed.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's a little button here.

Agent: Alright, try pressing and holding that button for about ten seconds. That'll perform a factory reset.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Doing that now.

(background sounds)

Customer: It's resetting, the lights are all going crazy...

Agent: That's expected. Let's give it a moment to boot back up.

(longer pause)

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... same thing. Green light, orange light blinking, red light. I'm not getting any internet.

Agent: Alright, I appreciate your patience, David. Unfortunately, if the reset didn't work, this suggests there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or possibly a problem with the line coming into your home from outside.

Customer: So what are you saying?

Agent: What I'm suggesting is that we'd likely need to send a technician out to your location to diagnose the issue properly. They can check the external line and also bring you a replacement modem if needed. Unfortunately, I'm not able to fully resolve this over the phone at this point.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet for work.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability for you. (pause) I'm showing we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we have an earlier appointment—well, actually, we have a same-day appointment window from 5 to 7 PM this evening if that works for you.

Customer: Tonight? That's... yeah, that could work actually. But it seems crazy that we can't just fix this over the phone.

Agent: I understand your frustration completely. In most cases we can, but with the reset not working and that persistent red light, it's pointing to a hardware or line issue that really does need an in-person look. The technician will be able to resolve it quickly once they're there.

Customer: (sighs) Alright, fine. Let's do tonight, 5 to 7.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I have a technician scheduled for tonight, 5 to 7 PM. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes. The technician will have all your account information, but it's helpful if you're home a few minutes early if possible.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Is there anything else I should try before they get here?

Agent: You can leave everything powered on and connected as is. That actually helps the technician see what's happening. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, David. We'll get you back online tonight. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Okay, bye.

Agent: Take care.
