Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I work from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that can be, especially when you're working from home. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. When exactly did you notice the internet went down?

Customer: Um, around 8 this morning? I was just trying to check my email and nothing was loading. Then I realized the whole thing was just... down.

Agent: Alright, and just to confirm, nothing is working at all, right? No lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Well, actually, let me look. (pause) Yeah, the modem has some lights on it. There's like a white light and... it looks like there's an orange one blinking?

Agent: Okay, so the orange light is blinking. That usually indicates a connection issue. Let me walk you through some basic troubleshooting. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Let that sit for about 30 seconds while I stay on the line with you. (pause) How's your day been otherwise?

Customer: Oh, you know, could be better. (chuckles) This internet thing isn't helping. I've got back-to-back calls this afternoon and I needed to prep some files.

Agent: Yeah, I totally get it. Alright, go ahead and plug that modem back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in... (pause) Alright, it's back on.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about a minute for it to fully boot up. While we do that, I'm going to check if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing now?

Customer: Um... still that orange light blinking. And the white one is still there.

Agent: The orange light is still blinking? Okay. And what about your router? Do you have a separate router?

Customer: Yeah, I've got a Netgear one that I set up myself.

Agent: Alright. Can you tell me what lights are showing on that?

Customer: (pause) It's not lit up at all, actually. Is that bad?

Agent: It might be. The router should be getting a signal from the modem. Let me have you unplug the router and plug it back in as well. Just give it a minute to boot up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging... (pause) and replugging. (pause) Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, hmm. Let me ask you this—have you had any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: Not that I know of, no. Everything else is working fine. My lights, my TV, everything.

Agent: Okay, good. Um, let me try a couple more things. That orange blinking light on the modem—can you tell me, is it a solid orange or is it flickering?

Customer: It's blinking. Like, on and off. On and off.

Agent: Right, okay. And the white light, is that solid?

Customer: Yeah, the white one is solid.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else. I'm going to have you do a factory reset on the modem. There should be a small reset button on the back. It might be recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something small.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking... (pause) Yeah, I found it. A small button?

Agent: That's the one. Go ahead and hold it down for about 10 seconds. This will erase all the settings, so we'll need to reprogram it, but let's see if that helps.

Customer: (pause) Okay, doing it now... (pause) Ten seconds... (pause) Alright, I let go.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait for the modem to restart. This might take a couple minutes. (pause) So, I'm assuming you've been a customer for a while?

Customer: Oh yeah, maybe three years now? I've never had a problem like this before. You guys are usually pretty reliable.

Agent: Well, I appreciate that. We do pride ourselves on our network reliability. (typing sounds) Alright, so it should be back online by now. What are you seeing?

Customer: (pause) Um... same thing. Orange light is still blinking. The white light is on.

Agent: (pause) Okay. And the router still isn't lighting up?

Customer: Nope, nothing.

Agent: Alright, let me check something on the modem itself. Is there a label on the back or bottom with any information on it?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's a sticker. It says... Frontier Fiber Modem, Model... FGW-B860. Does that help?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, FGW-B860. Let me see here... (pause) You know what, I'm wondering if there might be a line issue on our end. The factory reset should have cleared things up if it was just a configuration problem. The fact that the router isn't getting any signal from the modem is concerning.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: It could be, yeah. Or it could be an issue with the fiber connection coming into your home. Unfortunately, I'm unable to diagnose that remotely. What I'm thinking at this point is that we should get a technician out to your place to take a look. They'll be able to test the line and check your equipment.

Customer: How soon can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Let me check availability. (pause) Okay, so I can get someone out there... we have an opening tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Really? Can't someone come out today?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, our technicians are pretty booked up today. Tomorrow is the earliest I can get someone out. It would be a four-hour window, 12 to 4 PM.

Customer: (sighs) I guess I don't have much choice, do I? That's... that's going to have to work. I mean, it's not ideal, but...

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry about this. We'll waive the service call fee since this appears to be an infrastructure issue on our end. And hey, fingers crossed it's something simple once the tech gets there.

Customer: Okay, well... I guess I'll be there tomorrow between noon and four. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure someone is home to let the technician in. They'll have everything they need. The tech will be able to access the modem and check the line. Oh, and one more thing—I'd suggest having your account number handy. They might ask for it.

Customer: Yeah, I've got it. 555-0847.

Agent: Perfect. Just to confirm everything, we have a service call scheduled for tomorrow, [inaudible] 12 to 4 PM window. A technician will come out to diagnose the issue. We're waiving the service call fee. And you should receive a confirmation text or email shortly with more details.

Customer: Alright. Thank you. I really appreciate your help, even though we couldn't fix it remotely.

Agent: Of course. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve it today, but the tech should get you taken care of. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great rest of your day, and we'll see you tomorrow!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
