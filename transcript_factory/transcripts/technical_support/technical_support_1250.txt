Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just... it's just not working. Like, I can't get online at all.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, yeah it's... (pause) it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here. And your name is?

Customer: David. David Chambers.

Agent: Perfect, David. I see your account here. So you're saying you have no internet connection at all right now?

Customer: Right, yeah. Nothing. My computer won't connect, my phone won't connect to WiFi... nothing's working.

Agent: Alright, I understand. That's frustrating. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Do you have a modem and router, or do you have the combined unit we provided?

Customer: I think it's... it's the modem and router together? Like the white box thing?

Agent: Yes, that sounds like our combo unit. Okay, can you take a look at the lights on the front of that device for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, so... the power light is on. It's like, the green light. But um, I don't see any of the internet lights. Like, they're all off.

Agent: Okay, so just the power light. That's helpful information. Let's do a quick power reset. Can you unplug the modem for me, and then we'll wait about thirty seconds?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. While we're waiting, can I ask—did you have internet working this morning or earlier today?

Customer: Yeah, it was working fine this morning. I used it for like an hour before I left for work. Came home maybe twenty minutes ago and just... nothing.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so it was working this morning. Any storms in your area recently, or any outages you're aware of?

Customer: No, no storms or anything. It's been pretty clear actually. I did see something on the street earlier though—like a construction crew down at the end of the block. They were doing something with the lines.

Agent: Ah, interesting. That could be relevant. Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in... okay, it's back on.

Agent: Let's give it about sixty seconds to boot up fully. While that's happening, let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me the model number on the modem? It should be on a sticker on the bottom or back.

Customer: Um, hold on... (pause) It says... FTN-MOD-7842 I think?

Agent: FTN-MOD-7842, perfect. Okay, and you're seeing the power light come back on?

Customer: Yeah, the power light's on. The lights are... still just the power light though. No internet light yet.

Agent: It might take another moment or two. Sometimes it takes up to a minute and a half to fully boot. Let me just... (typing sounds) ...put you on a brief hold while I check the line status on your account. Should only be a moment.

Customer: Sure, yeah, okay.

Agent: (hold music for approximately 20 seconds)

Agent: Thank you for holding, David. Okay, so I'm seeing that there may be an issue on our network infrastructure in your area. The construction crew you mentioned might have actually impacted our fiber line. I'm showing some connectivity issues in your neighborhood starting about... (pause) ...about forty-five minutes ago.

Customer: Oh, so it's not my modem then?

Agent: Well, let me back up. The modem could still be part of it. Are you seeing any of the other lights now? The internet status light?

Customer: (pause) No, just the power light still. Hmm.

Agent: Okay. Let me try something else. Can you try restarting a device—like a computer or phone—while it's connected? Sometimes that helps initialize the connection.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'll restart my laptop real quick.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and do that.

Customer: (sounds of typing and clicking) Okay, restarting... (longer pause) ...still booting up here...

Agent: That's fine, take your time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back on. But like... I'm not seeing the WiFi network show up, and there's no ethernet cable plugged in anyway.

Agent: Right, okay. So you're not seeing the network broadcast at all. Let me ask—is your modem making any sounds at all? Like any clicks or unusual noises?

Customer: Sounds? No, I don't... I mean it's just kind of sitting there, humming like it normally does.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm—you tried the power reset, correct?

Customer: Yeah, I did that like, what, five minutes ago?

Agent: Right, we did. Let me try one more thing. Can you try a hard reset? There should be a small reset button on the back of the device. You'll need something like a paperclip to press it for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Hard reset? Um... (sounds of moving around) Okay, I'm looking... I see it. I see the button. (pause) Okay, holding it down... ten seconds you said? (pause) Let me count it out... one, two, three... (pause) ...eight, nine, ten. Okay, I'm releasing it.

Agent: Perfect. Now give it another minute or so to fully reboot after that hard reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, waiting here... The lights are still just—wait, I see... no, just the power light again. Still no internet light.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Alright, David, I've got to be honest with you. Given that you mentioned the construction in your area and that we're seeing issues on our network, combined with the modem not showing any connection status indicators, I'm thinking this might be a line-level issue rather than a modem issue at this point.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, how long is this going to take to fix?

Agent: That's a great question. Normally what I would do is send a technician out to diagnose and repair any line damage. However, because this appears to be related to that construction work, I want to make sure we get the right information to our field team. Let me transfer you to our technical support line where they can potentially expedite a technician visit or give you more information about what might be happening in your area.

Customer: Wait, why can't you just... schedule a technician for me now?

Agent: I absolutely can, and we should. But the technical support team has access to better information about what's happening in your neighborhood with that construction crew, and they might be able to tell you if this is something that's already being addressed. They can also prioritize your ticket accordingly.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, fine. Do I have to wait on hold long?

Agent: It shouldn't be too long. Let me get you transferred. Your confirmation number is 447829, just in case you need to reference this call. Can I have your best callback number?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Perfect. You're going to hear some hold music, and someone should be with you shortly. Thanks for your patience, David.

Customer: Yeah, thanks, I guess...

Agent: (transfer sounds, call ends)
