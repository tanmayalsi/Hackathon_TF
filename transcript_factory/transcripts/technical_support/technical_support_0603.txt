# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I'm showing an account for... is this David Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, David. So your internet service went down this morning? Let me just check our systems here... (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any outages in your area, so let's do some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what you're seeing? Is there any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Uh, let me look. The modem's in the bedroom. (pause) Yeah, there's... there's a red light on it. Just one red light.

Agent: Okay, so the modem's powered on but that red light typically indicates there's no internet connection coming into the device. Let's try a quick restart. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull it out completely.

Customer: Sure, unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, it's out.

Agent: Good. And while we're waiting, let me ask you—did anything happen before it went down? Any storms, power outages, anything like that?

Customer: No, no storms or anything. I was actually using it fine last night, watched some Netflix, and then when I got up this morning, nothing.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful information. Go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) It's booting up now. I can see the lights... (pause) ...and still just the red light.

Agent: Still just the red? Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm gonna send a signal to your modem to reinitialize it. That should take about 30 to 45 seconds. Can you tell me what other lights come on as it boots up?

Customer: Um... (pause) there's a green light on the left, then one that says like "internet" or something... (pause) ...oh, now it's orange.

Agent: Orange, okay. That's actually a step in the right direction. Orange usually means it's connecting or trying to negotiate with our network. Let's give it another minute or so to fully boot up.

Customer: Yeah, okay. (background noise of slight rustling) It's been like two minutes now and... (pause) no, it's back to just red again.

Agent: Hmm, it went back to red? (pause) Okay, let me try something else here. Have you checked if there's a coax cable—that's the thick cable that comes into the modem from the wall?

Customer: The cable? Yeah, it's... it's plugged in. I can see it right there.

Agent: Can you give it a gentle tug? Sometimes they can work themselves loose, especially if someone's moving things around.

Customer: (pause) Nope, it's tight. It's not going anywhere.

Agent: Alright. Let me try one more troubleshooting step. I'm going to reboot your modem from my end here. (typing sounds) Give me just a moment... (pause) Okay, I've sent the command. The modem should be rebooting now. You might see the lights flicker.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see them flickering. (pause) Okay, now they're... (pause) ...back to red again. This is ridiculous. I have a meeting in like twenty minutes and I need to get online.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. (pause) Let me check something in our system. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your modem history and... (pause) ...I'm actually seeing that there might be a signal issue coming into your location. The signal strength that we're reading is quite low on our end.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is that something you can fix?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It could be an issue with the line coming into your home, or it could be a problem further up the line in our network infrastructure. Unfortunately, from my end, I'm limited in what I can diagnose. What I'd like to do is schedule a technician to come out and physically inspect your line and equipment. They'd be able to test the signal strength in person and determine what's causing the problem.

Customer: When can someone come out? Like, is there any way they can come today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... (pause) We do have same-day appointments available. Our next available window would be between 2 and 4 PM this afternoon. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess that'll have to work. But I really need my internet back today.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get some information from you to schedule that appointment. Are you going to be home this afternoon?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. And what's the best phone number to reach you at if our technician needs to contact you?

Customer: It's the same number you have on file, 555-0847.

Agent: Great. (typing sounds) Okay, so I have a technician scheduled to arrive at your home sometime between 2 and 4 PM today. Your confirmation number is 847-FRN-2024. You should receive a text message and an email confirmation shortly with those details.

Customer: Okay, got it. So... is there anything else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: You know what, let's try one more thing just to be thorough. I want you to do a factory reset on the modem. This will clear any settings and restore it to factory defaults. Just to warn you, after this resets, you'll need your account number and some other information to set it back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, what do I need to do?

Agent: On the back of your modem, there should be a small recessed button labeled "Reset." You'll need to use something thin like a paperclip to hold it down for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm looking at the back. I see it. (pause) I'm holding it now... (pause) ...the lights are all going out... (pause) ...and they're coming back on.

Agent: Good. Now just let it fully restart. This should take a couple of minutes.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, waiting... (pause) ...okay, it's up. Still red light though.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, okay. Well, that confirms it's likely not a configuration issue on the modem itself. It's definitely something with the signal coming in from our network. The technician will be able to resolve this today.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything else, or...?

Agent: That's really all I can do from my end, unfortunately. But I want to make sure you have all the information. Your appointment window is 2 to 4 PM this afternoon, confirmation number 847-FRN-2024. The technician may arrive anytime in that window, so it's good that you'll be home.

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. I apologize again for the inconvenience, David. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I guess I'll just... wait for the technician.

Agent: Sounds good. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the trouble. We'll get you back online today.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day.
