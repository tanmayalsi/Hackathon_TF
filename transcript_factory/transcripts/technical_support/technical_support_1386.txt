Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it working because I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account really quick so I can help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing your account here. And just to confirm, you're calling from the service address on file?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. It's 342 Maple Street.

Agent: Perfect, thanks. So your internet's been down since this morning, you said? Have you tried unplugging the modem and router yet?

Customer: No, I haven't actually. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yes, that's usually the first thing we try. Go ahead and unplug both your modem and your router from the power source. Just wait about thirty seconds and then plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging them now... (background noise) Yeah, they're both unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's plug the modem back in and give it about two minutes to fully boot up.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's plugged back in. I can see the lights coming back on. It's got a green light and... hmm, it's got an orange light too, I think.

Agent: Okay, so you should see a solid green light once it's fully booted. The orange usually means it's still starting up. Let's give it just another minute or so.

Customer: (longer pause) Yeah, okay. Still got that orange light though. Do you think that's... is that bad?

Agent: Not necessarily. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, so that's good news. Now, after the modem fully boots, go ahead and plug your router back in.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (background noise) It's powered up.

Agent: Good. Give the router about ninety seconds to connect to the modem. In the meantime, can you tell me—have you noticed any damage to any of the cables outside your home? Any loose connections or anything like that?

Customer: Um... I mean, I haven't really looked recently. Everything seemed fine last night when I was using it. It just... it just stopped working this morning.

Agent: Right. Well, let's check that when we need to. So do you have any devices you can try connecting to the WiFi right now to see if you're getting a signal?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I've got my phone here. Let me pull up the WiFi settings... (pause) I don't see the WiFi network showing up at all, actually.

Agent: Okay, so the router isn't broadcasting a signal. Let me have you try something. Can you check the back of the modem and tell me if there's an ethernet cable plugged into it?

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, there's a cable plugged in. It's... it's got a light next to it. The light's amber or orange colored.

Agent: Okay, that amber light means it's not connecting properly. Can you unplug that ethernet cable and plug it back in? Make sure you hear it click into place.

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Okay... I'm doing that. (pause) Plugged it back in. The light's still... still orange.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) Can you tell me if you're seeing any red lights on the modem now?

Customer: Uh, no, I don't think so. Just the green one and the orange ones on a few of the ports.

Agent: And the WiFi light specifically—is that lit up at all?

Customer: (pause) I'm... I'm not really sure which one that is, honestly. I'm not great with tech stuff.

Agent: No problem, I get it. So just to the right of the power light, there should be a light that might say WiFi or have a signal icon. Is that on?

Customer: (background noise, pause) Oh, I don't think it's on, no. I don't see that light lit up.

Agent: Okay, so the router's not communicating with the modem. Let me have you do this—can you locate the reset button on the back of your modem? It's usually a small button you need to press with a paperclip or something.

Customer: (pause) I... I don't really want to reset it. Does that mean I'll lose everything?

Agent: No, it shouldn't affect anything on your computer or devices. It'll just reset the modem back to factory settings. But before we do that, let me try one more thing. Can you check and make sure the coaxial cable—that's the thicker cable that comes from the wall—is tightly connected to the modem?

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Yeah, it looks pretty tight. But, um... wait. I'm looking at it more closely and it looks a little... I don't know, it's hard to tell. Let me try tightening it.

Agent: Good idea. Just hand-tight, don't force it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm tightening it... (pause) I think that's good. Did that help?

Agent: Let me check the lights again. Are you seeing any changes?

Customer: (pause) No, it's still the same. Orange lights on the ports, and that WiFi light still isn't on.

Agent: Alright. Well, I think what we're dealing with here might be a signal issue from the street or possibly the modem itself. I'm going to need to escalate this to our technical team. But before I do that, let me have you try resetting the modem. It should only take a few minutes and it might resolve this.

Customer: Okay... (hesitant pause) If you think that'll help. How do I do it?

Agent: Grab a paperclip or a pushpin, hold down the reset button for about ten seconds, and then release. The modem will restart.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I found the button. Holding it down... (pause) Okay, releasing it now. Now what?

Agent: Now just give it a few minutes to restart. While it's doing that, let me check on some things in your account and see if there's anything else I can try remotely.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, I'm waiting. How much longer do you think this'll take?

Agent: Another minute or two, yeah. So while we're waiting, can you confirm the last time you had internet working properly? Was it last night?

Customer: Yeah, I was using it last night around... I don't know, maybe nine o'clock? And then this morning I turned my computer on and nothing.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so it just suddenly dropped. (pause) Alright, let's see if we're seeing any activity on your account now... I'm still not seeing a strong connection from your modem to our network.

Customer: Does that mean... is it broken or something?

Agent: It's hard to say at this point. It could be the modem, it could be a line issue from outside. I'm going to be honest with you—I think we're going to need to send a technician out to your place to diagnose what's happening. They'll be able to check the line and test everything properly.

Customer: (frustrated) Really? How long would that take? I need this fixed pretty soon.

Agent: I understand. Let me see what appointments we have available. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so we could get someone out there tomorrow between two and six PM, or the day after that in the morning, between eight and noon. Do either of those work for you?

Customer: (pause) I guess tomorrow afternoon would work. I'm just... I'm really frustrated that we couldn't fix this over the phone.

Agent: I hear you, and I'm sorry we weren't able to resolve it today. But sometimes these issues really do require hands-on troubleshooting. Let me get you scheduled. So that's tomorrow, two to six PM at 342 Maple Street. The technician will bring any equipment needed. You'll get a call from dispatch about thirty minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Tomorrow afternoon works.

Agent: Perfect. And in the meantime, if anything changes or if the internet somehow comes back on, just give us a call and we can cancel that appointment. But I'm confident the technician will get you sorted out.

Customer: Yeah, alright. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... that's everything.

Agent: Okay, well thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
