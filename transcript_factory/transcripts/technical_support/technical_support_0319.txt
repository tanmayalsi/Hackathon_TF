Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I work from home and I've got meetings all day.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the name on the account?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks, David. So your internet is completely down—you're not getting any connection at all?

Customer: Right, nothing. I tried restarting the modem this morning but it didn't help. The lights on it are just... they're not doing what they usually do.

Agent: Okay, good that you already tried that. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you looking at the modem right now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it. It's sitting right here on my desk.

Agent: Great. So on the front of the modem, there should be several lights. Can you tell me what colors they are and if any of them are blinking or solid?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I see... there's one that's red right now. And then there's another one that's just off, I think. It's not lighting up.

Agent: The red light—is it solid red or is it blinking?

Customer: It's solid. It's just... solid red.

Agent: Alright, and the other lights on the modem—are any of them green or blue?

Customer: (pause) Um, no. I don't see any green or blue. Just the red one and then a couple that are completely dark.

Agent: Okay, that solid red light typically indicates a connection issue between the modem and our network. Let's try a few things. First, I want you to unplug the modem from the power source completely.

Customer: Okay, (pause) unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. While that's unplugged, I want you to count to about thirty. Just give me a second.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been about thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in and let's see what happens.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Hmm, so the red light is back on and... actually, there's a yellow one now too.

Agent: Yellow is good—that means it's trying to reconnect. We should see that change in the next minute or so. Do you have a laptop or phone nearby that you can try to connect to the Wi-Fi?

Customer: I've got my phone. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at my Wi-Fi networks and I can see my Frontier network showing up.

Agent: Excellent. Go ahead and try to connect to it.

Customer: (pause) Entering the password... okay, it says it's connecting but... (pause) no, it's not connecting. It says "can't connect to this network."

Agent: Alright. Let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) David, I'm not showing any active connection from your modem to our network right now. Let me ask—do you have any other devices plugged into the modem? Like a computer or anything?

Customer: Just my ethernet cable for my desktop in the other room.

Agent: Okay, let's try disconnecting that ethernet cable. Sometimes if there's an issue with a connected device, it can cause problems.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. (pause) But... the modem's doing the same thing. Still red and yellow.

Agent: Okay. Can you check something for me? On the back of the modem, there should be a small reset button. It's usually recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something to press it.

Customer: Oh no, you want me to reset it?

Agent: I know it sounds drastic, but it might help. This will reboot the modem completely and reinstall the firmware. You'll need to set it back up, but—

Customer: Ugh, okay. (pause) I'm grabbing a paperclip. (pause) Do I hold it down?

Agent: Yeah, hold it down for about ten seconds until you see all the lights go out, then release it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, they're off. Now they're starting to come back on... lights are coming back.

Agent: (pause) Give it a minute or two to fully boot back up. This usually takes a couple minutes.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. (pause) Um, it's been a minute and I'm still just seeing the red light again and... I don't see the yellow anymore.

Agent: No yellow now, just red?

Customer: Just red. Is that bad?

Agent: (pause) That's... let me check something on the network. (typing sounds) (longer pause) David, I'm going to be honest with you. I'm not seeing your modem registering on our network at all right now. This could indicate a few things. It might be a provisioning issue or, um, it could be that there's something wrong with the modem itself.

Customer: Oh man. So what do we do?

Agent: Well, let me try something else. Are you able to access your account online? On the Frontier website?

Customer: I could, I guess. Why?

Agent: I want you to try logging into your account and see if there's any error messages or notifications about your service.

Customer: (pause) Okay, give me a second... (pause) Let me try to load the website... (pause) Okay, I'm logged in. It says my account is active, but then under service status it says "degraded service" with like a little warning symbol.

Agent: Alright, so the account recognizes there's an issue. Let me see... (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your service history. David, I see here that our technicians detected a signal issue at your location about forty-eight hours ago. Did you notice any connection problems yesterday?

Customer: Now that you mention it, yeah. It was really slow yesterday afternoon. I figured it was just my Wi-Fi.

Agent: Right, okay. So this has been degrading. I wish I had better news here, but given that the modem isn't even provisioning on the network and the signal issue we're seeing, this might be something that requires a technician visit to your location.

Customer: (frustrated) A technician? How long would that take? I have important calls today.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (pause, typing sounds) (pause) Okay, um... the earliest I can get someone out would be tomorrow afternoon between two and four PM.

Customer: Tomorrow? That doesn't work. I need this today.

Agent: I hear you, and I'm really sorry about that. Let me see if there's any possibility... (pause, typing sounds) I'm not showing any emergency slots available today. But let me ask—is there any possibility that you could access your internet through your mobile hotspot today as a temporary solution?

Customer: (pause) I mean... I guess? My data plan might get crushed though.

Agent: I know it's not ideal. And I want to make sure we get this resolved for you today if possible. Let me transfer you to our technical support escalations team. They have access to more tools and might be able to identify the exact issue or possibly get someone out sooner. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yeah, I guess that's my best option at this point.

Agent: Alright, David. I'm going to put you through to them now. Your reference number for this call is 4729-DFC. I apologize that we weren't able to get everything working today. The team I'm connecting you to is really great, and they'll do their best to help.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. You'll be connected shortly.
