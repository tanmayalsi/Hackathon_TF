# Frontier Communications - Technical Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications technical support. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I see your account here. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning? Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you able to see any lights on your modem right now?

Customer: Uh, yeah, let me walk over to it. (pause) Okay, so I've got... there's a green light on the front, and then there's like a red light blinking next to it.

Agent: Alright, and which light is which? Do you know what they indicate?

Customer: Um, I'm not really sure, to be honest. One looks like the power light, I think? And the other one is just... blinking red.

Agent: Okay, that red blinking light could indicate a connection issue. Let me have you try something for me. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet?

Customer: Right now?

Agent: Yes, please. Just unplug it, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) ...Alright, waiting. (longer pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and give it about two minutes to fully restart. While that's happening, let me just verify a few things on my end. (typing sounds) Have you had any recent storms in your area, or any service disruptions that you're aware of?

Customer: Uh, no storms that I know of. Yesterday was sunny, and today's been pretty nice too. Why?

Agent: Just covering all the bases. Sometimes weather can affect the lines, or there might be maintenance happening in your area. (pause) Okay, so it's been about a minute and a half now. How are those lights looking?

Customer: Um, still got the green light, but... the red one is still blinking. It's blinking a little slower maybe? I don't know.

Agent: Okay, let's give it another thirty seconds or so. Sometimes it takes a bit longer. (pause) Actually, while we're waiting, can you tell me... when you say the internet isn't working, do you mean you're not getting any connection at all, or is it just very slow?

Customer: No connection. I tried resetting my router, I tried unplugging it, I even restarted my computer. Nothing's working. I can't get online at all.

Agent: Alright, I understand. Let me check something. (typing sounds) So I'm looking at your line here, and I'm not seeing any active connection on our end either. That red light you're seeing actually matches what I'm seeing on my system.

Customer: Does that mean it's a problem with Frontier, or with my equipment?

Agent: That's a good question. It could be either. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you check the cable that goes from your modem to the wall? Sometimes they come loose or get damaged.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, I'm looking at it now. It looks fine to me. It's plugged in pretty tight.

Agent: You can try unplugging that cable from the modem and plugging it back in, just to make sure it's getting a good connection.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Done. Anything changing on your end?

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) No, I'm still not seeing a connection. Hmm. Let me try power cycling the equipment from my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I've sent a signal to reset your modem. Can you tell me if anything changes with those lights?

Customer: Uh... (long pause) No, same thing. Green light on, red light blinking.

Agent: Alright, I'm going to be honest with you. The fact that I'm not seeing a connection from my side suggests this might be a line issue rather than an equipment issue. The modem seems to be powering on fine, but it's not able to establish a connection to our network.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, ideally I would, but typically when we see this, it means there's either a problem with the line coming into your house or there's an issue at the node serving your area. (pause) I can schedule a technician to come out and investigate. They would be able to check the line physically.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what appointments we have available. (typing sounds) The earliest we have is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow morning? I mean... that's not ideal, but I guess if that's what we need to do. Can you guarantee they'll fix it?

Agent: I can't guarantee it, but they'll definitely get to the bottom of what's happening. They may be able to fix it on site, or they might need to order parts. But they'll have the tools and access to troubleshoot it properly.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, let me do that.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I have you scheduled for tomorrow, April 15th, between 8 AM and noon. A technician will come out to your address at... (pause, confirms address) Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. You'll receive a confirmation text and email with the appointment details. Make sure someone's available during that window to let them in.

Customer: Okay. So there's nothing else I can try tonight?

Agent: (pause) Well, honestly, I don't want to have you keep doing the same troubleshooting steps over and over. You've already done most of what I would recommend. The best thing to do is wait for the technician. If something changes before they arrive, you can always give us a call back.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate it, I guess. This is frustrating because I have meetings tomorrow morning.

Agent: I hear you, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Hopefully the technician will be able to get you up and running quickly. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Okay, thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone. We really do appreciate your business, and we'll get someone out to you as soon as we can tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, I guess. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Have a great day.
