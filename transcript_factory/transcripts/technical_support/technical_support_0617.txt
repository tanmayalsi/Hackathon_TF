# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so my internet just completely stopped working about an hour ago. I've got no connection at all.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your phone number or account number?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. Your service address is on Maple Street in Portland, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So your internet went down about an hour ago, you said? And you're not seeing any connection at all right now?

Customer: Right, nothing. My laptop, my phone on Wi-Fi... everything's just dead. I really need this for work, so...

Agent: I completely understand. Let me help you troubleshoot this. First, can you tell me what you're seeing? Is your modem powered on?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) ...yeah, the modem's on. I can see the lights are... well, some of them are blinking, but the internet light is red. Is that bad?

Agent: That red light typically indicates no internet connection coming to the modem. Okay, so let's do a power cycle. Can you unplug the modem for me right now?

Customer: Sure, one second. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. While that's unplugged, can you also unplug your router?

Customer: Oh, I don't have a separate router. I've got the combo unit you guys provided.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. So just leave the modem unplugged, and let's wait about thirty seconds. (pause) Are you there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: All right, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged in. (pause) The lights are coming back on. (longer pause) ...Um, the internet light is still red though.

Agent: It might take a moment to establish the connection. Let's give it about sixty seconds. While we wait, I'm also going to check on our end to see if there are any outages in your area or any issues with your account.

Customer: Okay, thanks. (background noise of waiting)

Agent: (typing sounds) All right, I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, and your account looks active on our end. How's that light looking now?

Customer: (pause) Still red. This is frustrating.

Agent: I know, I'm sorry. Let me try a few more things. Can you check the cable connections on the back of the modem for me? Make sure everything's plugged in tight?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... (pause) Yeah, they all look pretty secure to me. Both cables are in there.

Agent: Okay. And those are the coax cable coming from the wall and the power cable, right?

Customer: Yeah, exactly.

Agent: All right. Let me try something on my end. I'm going to send a signal refresh to your modem. This might take a minute or two. Can you keep an eye on the lights?

Customer: Okay, I'm watching them. (pause) Anything happening?

Agent: (typing sounds) It's processing now... (pause) ...and there we go, I've sent it through. What are you seeing?

Customer: (pause) Um... the lights are... they're flickering a bit now, but... (pause) ...still no internet light. It's still red.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Okay, let me try resetting the modem completely. This will clear out everything, so I'll need to set you back up. Can you press and hold the reset button on the back of the unit for about ten seconds?

Customer: The reset button? (pause) I'm not sure where that is.

Agent: It's usually a small recessed button. You might need a paperclip or a pen to press it. Look on the back panel.

Customer: (pause) Oh, I see it! It's super small. (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... (pause) ...and I'm still holding... ten seconds right? (pause) Okay, I let it go.

Agent: Good. Now the modem should restart completely. This might take a couple minutes. What's happening?

Customer: (pause) The lights are all going crazy for a second, and now they're starting to come back on one by one.

Agent: Perfect, that's normal. Let's wait for it to fully boot up. (pause) (typing sounds) While that's happening, let me see if I can get more information about what might be going on on our end. Have you had any recent storms or any kind of physical damage to your lines that you're aware of?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine this morning, and then I just... came back from lunch and nothing.

Agent: Okay. And you haven't made any changes to your equipment or anything?

Customer: Nope, nothing. It just stopped.

Agent: All right. How are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) They're still coming back on. I've got some green ones now, but that internet light... (pause) ...it's still red.

Agent: It's still red? (pause) Okay, that's... that's concerning. Let me check something. The modem should have gotten a new IP address from that reset. Can you tell me if you see any lights that are solid green right now, or are they all blinking?

Customer: (pause) Um, I see one that's solid green, and the others are blinking. The internet one's the only red one.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Let me try one more thing. I'm going to check if there's an issue with the line coming into your house. Can you look for the network interface box on the outside of your home? It might be mounted on the side or front of the house, usually has the Frontier logo on it.

Customer: Uh... (pause) ...give me a second. I'll have to look outside. (pause) Yeah, there's a box out here on the side. It looks like it might be covered in dirt though.

Agent: Can you see any lights on that box?

Customer: (pause) ...No, I don't see anything. It's pretty dark in there. Should there be lights?

Agent: There should usually be at least one light. Let me... hmm. (pause) Okay, we might have an issue with the signal coming into your house. Have you noticed any loose cables outside, or anything that looks unusual?

Customer: (pause) Not really, I mean, I'm not exactly a technician. Should I be checking for something specific?

Agent: Just look where the cable enters the box. Is it securely connected?

Customer: (pause) I can't really tell. It's pretty dark out here. Should I go get a flashlight?

Customer: Actually, you know what, let me come back inside. It's cold. I don't think I can really tell anything from just looking at it anyway.

Agent: I understand. Okay, let me be honest with you here—I've tried several troubleshooting steps, and typically at least one of them would have resolved the issue. The fact that we're not seeing any improvement suggests this might be a service delivery issue or a problem with the equipment itself, which could require an on-site technician.

Customer: (pause) So what does that mean? How long would that take?

Agent: Well, normally we can get someone out within 24 to 48 hours, depending on availability. But let me try just one more thing before we schedule that. I'm going to have you hard restart your modem one more time using the power button on the front.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) I'm holding down the power button... (pause) The lights just went off. Now I'm releasing it. (pause) Okay, it's powering back on again.

Agent: And let's see... (pause) ...we'll give it another minute or so to fully restart and connect.

Customer: (longer pause) Yeah, it's been a minute. The internet light is... [inaudible] ...still red, Derek.

Agent: (long pause) Yeah. I'm not going to mislead you—I think we're at the point where we need to get a technician out there. We've ruled out the basic troubleshooting, and there's likely something happening either with the line coming to your house or with the modem hardware itself that I can't diagnose over the phone.

Customer: Great, so how do I set that up?

Agent: I can schedule that for you right now. Let me just pull up our availability. What days work best for you?

Customer: Uh, I work from home, so pretty much any day. But sooner is better, obviously.

Agent: I understand. (typing sounds) (pause) It looks like our earliest availability is actually tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: That's... I guess that'll have to work. Do I need to do anything before they come out?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home to let them in, and if you could leave the modem plugged in so they can see the status of the lights when they arrive, that would be helpful. I'm going to put a note in your account about everything we've tried today.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Is there anything else I should do?

Agent: No, I think we've covered everything. The technician will take it from there. You should receive a confirmation text or email shortly with the appointment window. If you need to reschedule, just let us know as soon as possible.

Customer: All right. I appreciate you trying, Derek. I just... I really need this working for work tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. The technician should get you back up and running. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow. Have a good evening.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye now.
