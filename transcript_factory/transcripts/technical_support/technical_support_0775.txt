# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I work from home.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick so I can help you out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And what's the best number to reach you at if we get disconnected?

Customer: You can use that same number.

Agent: Great. So you're experiencing no internet connectivity at all right now, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. The router's on, the lights are blinking, but I can't get online. I tried resetting it earlier but that didn't help.

Agent: Alright, good thinking on trying that restart. Let me ask you a few questions. When did this start happening exactly?

Customer: Um, sometime this morning. I woke up around 7 and it was already out. So it's been probably like four or five hours now.

Agent: Okay. And have there been any storms or weather issues in your area recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been pretty clear all morning.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me just check your line here... (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, which is good news. So let's troubleshoot this together. First, can you tell me—do you have the modem separate from your router, or is it a combo unit?

Customer: It's separate. So I've got the modem and then the router next to it.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so here's what I want you to do. Can you unplug the modem first? Just pull the power cord out.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, unplugged.

Agent: Great. Leave that unplugged for about thirty seconds. While we wait, let me just clarify—when you say there's no internet, are you getting any error messages or anything?

Customer: Uh, just can't connect to anything. Like when I try to open Chrome, it just says no internet.

Agent: Mm-hmm, okay. That's helpful. Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Good. Give it about sixty seconds to fully boot up. You'll see some lights come on.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the lights are coming back on. Like they were before.

Agent: Okay, and what color are they? Can you describe which lights are on for me?

Customer: There's a green one on the top, and then... there's a red one below it. Is that bad?

Agent: The red light could indicate a connection issue. Let me think... (pause) Okay, so we want that to be green. Let me ask you this—do you see a power light that's just solid green?

Customer: Yeah, there's one that's solid green. That one's fine. But the other one below it is definitely red.

Agent: Right, and is that red light blinking or solid?

Customer: (pause) It's blinking. Like every couple seconds it blinks red.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to be honest with you—that usually means the modem is having trouble connecting to our network. Let me try a few things here. (typing sounds) I'm going to send a refresh signal to your modem right now. This might take a minute.

Customer: Okay, um, should I do anything?

Agent: No, just keep an eye on that red light and let me know if it changes color. It might take about a minute or two.

Customer: (pause) Alright... still red. Still blinking.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try something else. Can you check the cable connections for me? The coaxial cable—that's the thick cable—coming from the wall into the modem. Is it connected securely?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... yeah, it looks pretty tight. Like, it's screwed in good.

Agent: Alright, and is that cable coming from a wall outlet or is it... can you describe where it's coming from?

Customer: It's coming from like, the outlet in the wall. The cable box.

Agent: Right, okay. And do you see any damage on that cable at all? Any cuts or anything?

Customer: No, looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay. Let me try powering down the modem again, but this time I want you to also unplug the router while we're at it. Can you do that for me?

Customer: (pause) Uh, yeah, both unplugged now.

Agent: Perfect. Leave them unplugged for about two minutes this time. While we wait, let me just double-check some things on my end here. (typing sounds) You know, this could also be an issue with the line itself. When was the last time you had internet working normally?

Customer: This morning it was fine. Everything was working when I went to bed yesterday. So overnight, I guess. Sometime overnight it went out.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's helpful. Yeah, go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) It's back in.

Agent: And then once you see it fully boot up, we'll plug the router back in. Give it about ninety seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) Alright, it's booted up.

Agent: And are we still getting that red blinking light?

Customer: Yeah, unfortunately. Same thing.

Agent: Same red blinking. Okay... (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug your router back in now.

Customer: Okay, router's back in.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me try one more thing. I'm going to send another signal to reboot your modem remotely. Just give me one second... (typing sounds) Okay, this is going to restart the modem on my end. It's going to take a few minutes.

Customer: How long do you think this is going to take? I'm supposed to log into a meeting in like twenty minutes.

Agent: I understand. Unfortunately, if this doesn't work, we may need to get a technician out to your location to check the line coming from the street. That typically takes about 24 to 48 hours to schedule. But let's see if this next attempt works. Just give it a couple minutes.

Customer: (pause) Okay...

Agent: (longer pause) Okay, are you still there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here. Still red light.

Agent: (sighs) I'm not seeing any change on my end either, unfortunately. Let me check one more time if there are any outages... (typing sounds) No, still showing clear in your area. 

Look, I think at this point what we might be dealing with is either a line issue coming from outside your home or possibly a modem failure. I want to be upfront with you about that.

Customer: So what do you mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: It could be. Or it could be something with the connection line itself from the street. I can't really tell from here. Given everything we've tried—the power cycles, the signal resets—[inaudible] this is pointing to a hardware issue on one end or the other.

Customer: So what do I do?

Agent: So here's what I can do. I can schedule a technician to come out and diagnose the issue. They'll check the line from the street and potentially swap out your modem if needed. Would that work for you?

Customer: How long is that going to take? I really need internet today if possible.

Agent: (pause) I completely understand. Let me see what we have available... (typing sounds) It looks like we might be able to get someone out there tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that window work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... I mean, not ideal, but I guess that's better than nothing.

Agent: I know it's not ideal. I'm sorry about that. But our technicians should be able to resolve this pretty quickly once they're there. They'll either fix the line issue or replace the modem.

Customer: Alright, I guess I'll take that appointment.

Agent: Great. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so that's tomorrow, Tuesday, between 8 AM and noon. We'll send you a confirmation text and email. Your confirmation number is 847-FRX-2204. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: I guess... is there any way to like, get a credit or something for today? I mean, I can't work without internet.

Agent: (pause) You know what, let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) I'm actually going to apply a service credit to your account for today's outage. That should show up on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, well... thanks for that, I guess. I just really hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I understand completely. I apologize for the inconvenience today. Our technician should absolutely be able to get you back up and running. If you have any questions before they arrive, feel free to give us another call.

Customer: Alright, I'll do that. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today. We'll see you tomorrow. Have a good one.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
