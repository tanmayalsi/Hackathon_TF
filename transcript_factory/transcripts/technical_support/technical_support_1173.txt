Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of and nothing's working.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's... (pause) ...hold on, let me find my bill. Okay, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm pulling that up now. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have there been any recent changes or storms in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine last night and when I woke up this morning, the router just had no lights on it. Like, nothing. Not even the power light.

Agent: Okay, so the router isn't powered on. Let me start with the basics here. Is the power cable plugged in securely to both the router and the wall outlet?

Customer: (slight frustration) Yeah, I checked that. The cable's plugged in. I even tried a different outlet and nothing happened.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful information. And you're not seeing any lights on the device at all?

Customer: No. It's completely dead. But I can see the modem—that's the box next to it—and that one has some lights on it. Just not the router.

Agent: Okay, so the modem has power but the router doesn't. That actually helps narrow things down. Let me ask—do you see a power button on the router itself? Sometimes they have a separate power switch.

Customer: (pause) Oh, wait... (sounds of movement) ...let me check. There's like a... yeah, there's a button on the back. Let me try pressing that.

Agent: Great, go ahead.

Customer: (pause) I pressed it but... nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay. And the power adapter for the router, the brick that plugs into the wall, does it feel warm to the touch at all?

Customer: (pause) No, it's cold. Completely cold.

Agent: That suggests the power adapter itself may have failed. But before we go down that route, let me try one more thing. Can you unplug the router from the wall for about thirty seconds? Just the power cable.

Customer: Sure. (pause) (unplugging sounds) Okay, it's unplugged. How long do you want me to wait?

Agent: About thirty seconds should do it. I'll wait with you here.

Customer: (pause) Alright... (pause) ...okay, it's been about thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (plugging sounds) (pause) ...okay, it's plugged back in and... (pause) ...nope. Still nothing. No lights at all.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, unfortunately that didn't do the trick. Let me check something on my end here. (pause) I'm looking at your account and I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, so that's good news. But given that the modem has power and the router doesn't, and that the power adapter isn't providing any power... I believe your router's power supply has failed.

Customer: So the router's broken?

Agent: It appears that way, yes. The power adapter isn't functioning, which is why you're not getting any power to the device. Now, the good news is we can get you a replacement. How long have you had that router with us?

Customer: (pause) I don't know, maybe two years? Maybe three?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see... it looks like you've had it for about twenty-eight months. So it's still covered under our standard warranty. We can absolutely get a replacement shipped out to you.

Customer: Okay, how long will that take?

Agent: Standard shipping is usually three to five business days. However, let me check if we have any expedited options. (pause) We do have next-business-day shipping available, but there would be a fifteen-dollar expedited fee for that.

Customer: (slight frustration) ...fifteen dollars? So I don't have internet for three to five days and then I have to pay extra to get it faster?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Unfortunately, since this is equipment failure rather than a service outage on our end, the standard shipping wouldn't have an additional fee. But if you'd like it sooner, the expedited option would be available for that fee. Alternatively, you could visit one of our local retail locations if you have one nearby to pick up a replacement today.

Customer: Do you know where the closest one is to me?

Agent: I can look that up for you. I'm showing... (pause) ...the closest location would be on Maple Street, about four miles from your address. They're open until 6 PM today if you want to swing by.

Customer: (pause) It's already 3:30, so I guess I could do that. But what if they don't have the right router? The same model I have?

Agent: That's a fair concern. Let me get you the phone number for that location so you can call ahead and confirm they have your model in stock. (pause) The number is 555-0198. Just let them know you need a replacement under warranty and they should be able to help you.

Customer: (pause) Alright. Yeah, I guess I'll give them a call. So if I pick it up today, I should be good to go once I set it up, right?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. Once you get home with the replacement, just plug it in and connect it to your modem. The setup should be straightforward since your previous configuration should still be on file. You should be back online pretty quickly.

Customer: Okay. And... I guess I just wanted to ask... I mean, is there any possibility that it's something else? Like, I don't know, maybe something with the service itself?

Agent: Well, let me do one more check. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your modem connection and your service is provisioned correctly. The modem is showing as connected to our network, which is a good sign. The issue is really just that the router isn't powered. If the router were to come on, you'd have internet access.

Customer: But what if I pick up the router and plug it in at home and it still doesn't work? Then what?

Agent: That's an understandable worry. If for some reason the replacement router still doesn't power on, we can absolutely troubleshoot further or look into other options. But typically, if the issue is the power adapter, a new unit should resolve it completely.

Customer: (pause) Alright. Alright, I'll head over to that store then.

Agent: Perfect. Just remember to give them a call first to make sure they have your model available. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. I'm sorry you had to deal with this, but I'm glad we got you sorted out. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
