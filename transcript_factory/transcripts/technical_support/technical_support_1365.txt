Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I work from home and I've got meetings coming up.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... hold on, let me grab my bill. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the address on 42 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Can you tell me what you're experiencing right now? Are you seeing any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Uh, yeah, so I have the modem here in front of me. The power light is on, it's green, but the internet light... it's not on. It's just dark. And my router is, uh, also powered on but nothing's connecting to it.

Agent: Okay, okay. So the modem has power but the internet indicator isn't lit up. That's actually really helpful information. Let me ask you a couple quick questions. Did anything change with your setup recently? Like, did you move anything around or have any storms last night?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine yesterday. I was using it all evening and I shut everything down before bed, and then this morning when I turned it on, nothing.

Agent: Got it. Alright, so let's try a few troubleshooting steps. First thing I'd like you to do is unplug the modem from the power outlet. Just the modem, not the router yet.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Done.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about thirty seconds. Just... give it a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm counting. It's been about thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: (pause, then plugging sound) Alright, it's back in. The lights are coming back on. Power light is green again. Um... (pause) But the internet light is still not on. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's... that's interesting. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Hmm. So I'm looking at your modem here and I'm not seeing it connecting to our network. That tells me it could be an issue on the line side. Have you checked the coaxial cable coming into your modem? The one that comes from the wall?

Customer: The cable from the wall? Let me... yeah, I see it. It's plugged in. It looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay, can you try unplugging that cable from the modem and then plugging it back in? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: Sure, let me try that. (pause, unplugging sound) Alright, it's out. (pause) And... plugging it back in. (clicking sound) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Good. Give it a moment to reconnect. Do you see any change on the modem?

Customer: (pause) No, nothing. The internet light is still off. It's been like ten seconds and... no, still nothing.

Agent: Alright, let me check the network status on my end again. (typing sounds, longer pause) Um, so I'm still not seeing your modem come online. That's... that's a bit concerning. Let me ask you something. Do you have a backup battery backup connected to your modem?

Customer: A backup? Like a UPS or something?

Agent: Exactly, yeah. A UPS or a battery backup system.

Customer: No, I don't think so. It's just plugged straight into the wall outlet.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. Um, can you tell me... when you look at the modem, are there any other indicator lights that seem unusual? Any red lights or anything blinking erratically?

Customer: Let me look. (pause) There's the power light which is solid green. There's a light that says "online" next to it and that one is off. Then there's like three more lights below that and they're all... they're all dark. No blinking or anything.

Agent: Okay. And none of them are red?

Customer: No, all dark except the power light.

Agent: (sighs) Alright, so at this point, what I'm thinking is that either the modem itself might have gone bad, or there could be an issue with the line coming into your house. Since we're not seeing any connection on our side, I want to try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the modem?

Customer: A factory reset? Is that going to... I mean, will I lose anything?

Agent: No, you won't lose anything important. It'll just reset it back to the default settings. But before we do that, let me make sure this is the right step. Do you remember what model modem you have?

Customer: Um, it says... Frontier... and then there's a number. It's a Frontier-branded one. I think it says something like FXC or FX... FXC-something on the back.

Agent: Okay, that's one of our standard models. The factory reset should be fine for that. You should see a small recessed button on the back of the modem. You might need a paperclip or something thin to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking for it. (pause) Yeah, I see a little button. It's recessed.

Agent: Perfect. So what you're going to do is hold that button for about ten seconds while the modem is powered on.

Customer: While it's powered on? Okay. (pause, then straining sound) I've got a paperclip, I'm pressing it... (pause) Okay, holding it... this feels like it's been ten seconds, should I let go?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and let go.

Customer: (pause) Okay. So the lights just went out completely. Now they're coming back on. The power light is on again... (pause) ...and it's cycling through. I can see different lights turning on and off. There's... is this normal?

Agent: Yeah, that's normal. That's the modem rebooting. Just give it a couple minutes to fully start back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. (pause) It's still cycling through. (pause) Alright, so now... the power light is steady green. And... no, the internet light is still off. Still nothing.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so we still don't have a connection on this end. I'm not seeing your modem check back in. At this point... (pause) I think there might be a hardware issue with the modem or possibly a line issue that I can't diagnose over the phone. What I'd like to do is schedule a technician to come out and take a look at this in person.

Customer: A technician? How long is that going to take? I really need my internet back up today if possible.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) So ideally, we have some technicians available later this week. The soonest I can get someone out there is... (pause) tomorrow afternoon, between one and four PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I have meetings all day. Isn't there anything earlier? Could someone come this morning or this afternoon?

Agent: I wish I could help you there. Let me see if there's any way to expedite this. (pause, typing sounds) Unfortunately, all of our afternoon slots are booked up today. Tomorrow at one to four PM is the earliest opening we have. I know it's not ideal...

Customer: Yeah, it's not. But I guess I don't have much choice. Can you at least make sure someone comes? I really need this fixed.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to get you on the schedule for tomorrow, and I'll put a note on your account that this is a priority. Before I do that, though, is there anything else we can try right now? Anything at all?

Customer: I... I don't know. What about my router? Should I reset that too?

Agent: You know what, that's actually a good idea. Let me... let me have you try that. Go ahead and reset your router the same way. There should be a button on the back of that too.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I found it. (pause) Okay, holding it down... (pause) And the lights are going out... (pause) Coming back on... (pause) Okay, it's rebooted. But... (sighs) the modem still doesn't have an internet connection, so my router still can't connect either.

Agent: Yeah, I expected that, unfortunately. If the modem isn't connecting to our network, the router won't help. Okay, well, let me get you scheduled for that technician visit tomorrow. I'm going to send a confirmation email to the address on your account. Can you confirm that email is still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yes, that's still correct.

Agent: Great. So tomorrow, one to four PM, we'll have a technician come out and check your line and possibly replace your modem if needed. Is there anything else I can help clarify?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just... I really hope this gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I understand, and I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone today. The good news is that once the technician gets out there, we should be able to identify what's going on and get you back online. In the meantime, if anything changes or if you happen to get it working on your own, just give us a call back and we can cancel the appointment.

Customer: Okay, will do. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize. We really appreciate your patience. You should receive that confirmation email within the next few minutes. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's everything.

Agent: Alright, have a good day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
