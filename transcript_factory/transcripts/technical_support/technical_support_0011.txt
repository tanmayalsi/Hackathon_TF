Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, my name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out and I can't get it back up. I've been without service for like, I don't know, twenty minutes now? And I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I grab your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Yeah, it's... hold on. (rustling sounds) It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get your name please?

Customer: It's David. David Chen.

Agent: Thanks, David. Okay, I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan in the Aurora area. Before we jump into troubleshooting, have you experienced any outages in your area recently? Or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, this is the first time. Everything was working fine this morning, and then like an hour ago I just... nothing. The internet just stopped.

Agent: Okay. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you able to see the router right now? And can you tell me what lights are showing on it?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I'm looking at it now. Um... the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light—the one that should be blue—that one's not on at all. It's just dark.

Agent: Okay, so the power is good but we're not seeing an internet connection light. That's helpful. Have you tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, let's try that first. Go ahead and unplug it from the power outlet, and then we'll wait about thirty seconds before you plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) ...waiting... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. And while that's booting back up, let me also ask—do you see the optical network terminal? It's usually a white box, might be near your router or could be mounted on a wall?

Customer: Oh, um... yeah, I think I see it. There's a white box over there by the window.

Agent: Perfect. Can you check the lights on that for me? There should be a few of them. What colors are you seeing?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it... there's a green light and... there's a red light. Is that bad?

Agent: A red light, yeah, that actually tells us something. That usually means there's an issue with the connection coming into your home. The red light indicates a signal problem on our end. Let me check our system here to see if there's anything going on in your area... (typing sounds, pause)

Customer: Okay... so what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, I'm not seeing any reported outages in your neighborhood, which is good news actually. But that red light is telling us the signal isn't getting through properly. Let me have you try something. On that optical network terminal, there should be a small reset button. It's usually a little recessed button you'd need a paperclip or pen to press.

Customer: Uh, let me see... (pause) Yeah, I see it. Should I press it?

Agent: Go ahead and hold it down for about ten seconds. That'll do a full reset of the terminal.

Customer: (pause) Okay... holding it... (pause) ...and it's rebooting, I think. The lights are cycling through. (pause) Now it looks like... the green light is back, but the red light is still there.

Agent: Hmm, okay. (pause) Let me check something here. Has your internet been working perfectly up until today? No slowdowns or anything like that?

Customer: No, it's been great actually. Really fast. That's why this is so weird.

Agent: Right, I understand. Okay, so the red light persisting after the reset is... it's suggesting that maybe there's an issue with the line itself coming into your area. I'm going to be honest with you, David—this could be something on our infrastructure side that I'm not going to be able to fix from here.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, what happens now?

Agent: Well, I can definitely get a technician scheduled to come out and do a full diagnostic on everything. They can check the line, the terminal, all of it. Do you have availability in the next day or two?

Customer: I mean... I need this fixed as soon as possible. I'm working from home right now. Can they come out today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available... (pause) Unfortunately, our next available appointment in your area is tomorrow between 2 and 6 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: (frustrated sigh) I guess it has to, doesn't it? But like, there's no way to fix this right now? You're sure?

Agent: I've walked through the basic troubleshooting steps with you, and normally that would resolve most connection issues. The fact that that red light is still showing on the terminal after a reset... that typically indicates it's on our end. The technician will be able to test the actual line and see if there's a break or a signal degradation somewhere. They might be able to fix it on the spot.

Customer: Okay... yeah, fine. Go ahead and schedule it for tomorrow.

Agent: Perfect. So I've got you down for a technician visit tomorrow, between 2 and 6 PM. A technician will call you about an hour before they arrive to confirm. Your confirmation number is 445782. We really do apologize for this inconvenience, David.

Customer: Yeah, well... hopefully they can actually fix it. This is pretty frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand. And listen, once the technician resolves this, if you're still experiencing any issues, don't hesitate to call us back. We'll make it right.

Customer: Okay. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, David, thank you for calling Frontier Communications. We appreciate your business, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
