Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I can't figure out what's going on. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get your name?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Alright, I see your account here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Did anything happen before it stopped working? Like a power outage or a storm in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I was just using it normally and then... I don't know, it just died. No warning or anything.

Agent: Okay. Well, let's troubleshoot this together. First, I'd like you to look at your modem—it should be a black box, probably near your router. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on it?

Customer: (pause) Uh, yeah. So there's... there's no lights on at all. It's completely dark.

Agent: Completely dark? Okay. And the power cable—is it plugged in?

Customer: Of course it's plugged in. (slight irritation) I'm not an idiot.

Agent: No, no, I apologize. That's just something we have to check. Um, can you unplug the power cable and count to ten, then plug it back in? That's going to do a hard reboot.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, unplugging it now. One... two... three... (pause) ...ten. Plugging back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about a minute for it to boot up. Can you watch the lights and tell me when they start coming on?

Customer: (long pause) Okay, so I'm seeing a red light now. Just red.

Agent: Just red? Okay, that's... that's not ideal. Ideally we'd see a green light. The red typically indicates an error. Um, is there any number on the front of the modem? Can you read me the model number?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it says... "Netgear CM500."

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, CM500. That's a good modem. Alright, so what I'm thinking is... there might be a service issue in your area, or there could be a problem with your modem itself. Let me just check if there are any outages reported in your neighborhood. (pause) What's your address?

Customer: 427 Riverside Drive, apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm checking that now. (longer pause) Hmm. I'm not seeing any reported outages in that area. But that doesn't mean there isn't something. Can you try the other reboot procedure? It's called a factory reset. On the back of the modem, there should be a small reset button. You'll need to hold it down for about fifteen seconds with a paperclip or something small.

Customer: (sounds of rummaging) I don't have a paperclip... do you have something else I can use?

Agent: A pen, a toothpick, anything small and pointy should work.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I got a pen. (more movement sounds) I'm holding the button down... I can feel it clicking in.

Agent: Good. Just keep holding it for the full fifteen seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm at about fifteen now. I'm letting go.

Agent: Alright. The modem should restart again. This time it might take a couple minutes. While we wait for that, let me ask—your router is still powered on and everything, right?

Customer: Yeah, the router's fine. It has lights on it.

Agent: Okay, good. And are you seeing any lights on the modem yet?

Customer: (pause) No... still nothing. This is really frustrating. I have to work from home today.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. (pause) You know what, let me wait another minute here because sometimes it takes a little longer after a factory reset. (pause) Anything now?

Customer: No. Still dark. Not even the red light this time.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Unfortunately, James, it sounds like your modem might have experienced a hardware failure. When a modem won't power on at all, especially after a hard reset, that's usually a sign of a physical problem with the device itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? I need a new modem?

Agent: Yes, I think so. So here's what we can do—we can send you a replacement modem at no charge. It should arrive within... (typing sounds) ...two to three business days with standard shipping. Or, if you want, you can visit one of our retail locations today and pick one up.

Customer: Two or three days? I need internet today. I have conference calls and everything.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see if we have any expedited shipping options. (pause) Unfortunately, the expedited shipping would be an additional fee, and it might still be tomorrow at the earliest.

Customer: How much is expedited?

Agent: That would be... (typing sounds) ...twenty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents for overnight.

Customer: (long pause) That's ridiculous. Why is my modem broken? What did you guys do?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Based on what we've troubleshot here, it appears to be a hardware failure, which can happen occasionally with equipment. It's not something we did—sometimes these things just fail. But I do apologize that you're in this situation.

Customer: Can't you just, I don't know, get someone to come out today? I'll pay for it.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) For a technician visit today, it looks like... (pause) ...unfortunately, we don't have any same-day appointments available in your area. The earliest I can get someone out would be tomorrow between 8 AM and 6 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow? And I'd have to pay for that?

Agent: A service call would normally be forty-nine ninety-nine, but given that this is a modem failure, I can waive that fee for you.

Customer: (pause) So my only options are either pay thirty dollars for overnight shipping, pick it up somewhere today, or wait until tomorrow?

Agent: Those would be your fastest options, yes. Or we can send the standard shipment at no charge, but that would be two to three business days.

Customer: [inaudible] This is... okay, where can I pick one up? Do you have a store near me?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see. The closest Frontier authorized retailer to you would be... (pause) ...the one on Meadowbrook Avenue, about four miles from you. They're open until 6 PM today.

Customer: Okay. And they'd have the modem in stock?

Agent: Let me just... (pause) I can't check their live inventory from here, but I can put in a note that you're coming and have them set one aside. What time do you think you'd be able to get there?

Customer: I don't know. Maybe in an hour or so?

Agent: Perfect. Let me make that note for you. (typing sounds) Alright, I've flagged that a customer named James Mitchell will be coming in today to pick up a replacement modem. The store address is 1247 Meadowbrook Avenue, Suite B. The phone number there is 555-0831 if you want to call ahead just to confirm they have it.

Customer: Okay, I guess that's... that's my best option.

Agent: I really am sorry about this, James. Once you get the new modem installed, if you have any issues, just give us a call back and we'll walk you through the setup.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No. That's it.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for calling Frontier, and again, I apologize for the trouble. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
