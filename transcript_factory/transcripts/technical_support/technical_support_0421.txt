Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you taken care of. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage this morning. Just to start troubleshooting, can you tell me—is your modem powered on? Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Um, yeah. Let me look... The lights are on. I see like a green light, I think, and maybe a blue one?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So you're getting power to the modem at least. Can you describe what you're seeing? Are the lights steady or are they blinking?

Customer: They're... I think they're steady. One of them's steady. Wait, actually, I'm looking at it now and it looks like one of them might be blinking. The... I don't know, the bottom one maybe?

Agent: Alright. So if one light is blinking, that could indicate it's still trying to sync. The modem might just be initializing. How long has it been down?

Customer: Since like seven or eight this morning? It's almost noon now, so... over three hours.

Agent: Okay, so it's been a while. That's definitely longer than a normal boot cycle. Let me ask you this—when you try to connect to the internet on your computer or phone, what happens? Do you see the Frontier network available?

Customer: Yeah, I can see the network name, and I can connect to it, but like, nothing loads. The pages won't load. It's just stuck.

Agent: Interesting. So you're able to connect to the WiFi but you're not getting any internet. That actually narrows it down a bit. Can you do me a favor and unplug the modem for about thirty seconds? Just pull the power cable out completely.

Customer: Sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: And just wait about thirty seconds while it's off. That'll help clear any cached information.

Customer: (pause) Alright, thirty seconds... should be about right.

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. (pause) The lights are coming back on.

Agent: Good. Sometimes that helps reset the connection to our network. Let's give it about a minute to fully boot back up and establish that connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay...

Agent: While we're waiting, I'm not seeing any service outages on your line, so that's... that's a good sign. (pause) Alright, try checking now. See if you can open a website or something.

Customer: (pause) Um... no. Still nothing. It's still not working. I'm trying to load Google and it's just... nothing's happening.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Let me check a couple other things. Can you tell me if you see any lights that are red on the modem?

Customer: No, I don't see any red lights.

Agent: Right, so the status lights seem normal, which is... (pause) that's unusual. Okay, let me try one more thing. Can you restart your computer as well? Sometimes it's a configuration issue with the device.

Customer: You want me to restart the computer?

Agent: Yeah, just restart your device and then we'll test again.

Customer: Alright, hold on... (pause) This might take a minute. It's restarting. (pause) [inaudible] ... should be good in a second...

Agent: No problem, I'll be right here.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back up. Let me try again... (pause) No. Still nothing. It's still not connecting.

Agent: Alright. Um, this is... let me see here. (typing sounds) So I'm looking at your account and everything looks provisioned correctly on our end. Let me check if there's maybe an issue with the line itself. Can you tell me—do you have any other devices you could try? Like a phone or a tablet?

Customer: Yeah, I have my phone. Let me try connecting...

Agent: Go ahead.

Customer: (pause) Same thing. It connects to the WiFi but there's no internet. Nothing loads.

Agent: Okay, so it's affecting all devices, which tells me it's a modem or connection issue, not a device issue. (pause) I'm going to be honest with you, this is... this is a bit tricky. We've done the basic troubleshooting and the modem seems to be functioning from a power and status perspective, but you're not getting an internet connection. This might indicate a hardware failure or a line issue that I can't fully diagnose over the phone.

Customer: So what do I do? I need my internet working.

Agent: I completely understand. I think what we need to do here is get a technician out to your location to physically check the modem and the line connection. They'll be able to swap out the modem if needed or check for any physical issues with the line.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... We have an opening tomorrow afternoon, between 1 PM and 5 PM. Or we could potentially get someone out the day after tomorrow in the morning if that works better for your schedule.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be better. Can you do that?

Agent: Absolutely. I can schedule that for you. Let me just confirm—that's still 555-0147, and the service address is on Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right. And someone will be there tomorrow between 1 and 5?

Agent: Yes. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly, and we recommend having someone at home to let the technician in. Is there anything else I can help you with while we wait for the service appointment?

Customer: No, I guess that's... I guess that's it. I'm just really frustrated that I've been without internet all day.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. Our technician should be able to get you back online tomorrow. If anything changes or you need to reschedule, just give us a call back. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: Thank you for your patience, and sorry again for the inconvenience. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's all.

Agent: Alright, thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
