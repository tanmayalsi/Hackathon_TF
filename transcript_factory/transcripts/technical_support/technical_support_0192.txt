Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, my internet went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of. It's just completely down.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here... and I've got you. Your name is David Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So your internet service is completely out right now?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. I've got no connection at all. My router's lights are all dead.

Agent: Okay, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First thing I'd like you to do is locate your modem and router. Do you have those handy?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at them right now. They're both just sitting here on the shelf by my desk.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, the lights on both devices are off?

Customer: The modem has... wait, actually the modem has a couple of lights on. Let me look closer. There's like a power light that's on, but the internet light is red or... no, it's not on at all. And the router is completely dark.

Agent: Okay, so the modem has power but no internet indicator. The router appears to be off. Let's start by power cycling both devices. Can you unplug the modem first and just hold for about 30 seconds?

Customer: (background noise, rustling) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) thirty seconds...

Agent: While we're waiting on that, I'm also going to check if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) What's your service address, David?

Customer: It's 342 Maple Street, Apartment 4B, in Henderson.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm checking... Henderson, Nevada?

Customer: Yeah.

Agent: (pause) I'm not showing any reported outages in your area right now, so that's good news. Go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: Plugging it back in... (rustling) Okay.

Agent: And give that about a minute to fully boot up. While that's happening, can you also unplug your router?

Customer: (pause) The router... okay, unplugging that too.

Agent: Perfect. Now while those are rebooting, let me ask you—when did this actually start? Was there a power outage or anything unusual happen before the internet went out?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I was just working from home and then... I don't know, I think I noticed it maybe around three o'clock? I was in the middle of a Zoom call and everything just froze and then I lost the connection.

Agent: Ah, so it happened pretty suddenly.

Customer: Yeah, pretty sudden.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Is the modem showing any lights now?

Customer: Um, yeah. The power light is on and... I think I see a couple other lights blinking. Not the internet one though.

Agent: Alright, that's normal during boot-up. Give it another 20 seconds or so. And then go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause, rustling) Okay, plugging the router in now.

Agent: (pause) How about now? Is the internet light on the modem coming on?

Customer: (pause) No... no, still nothing. The router is starting to light up though. I can see... yeah, I see some orange lights on the router now.

Agent: Orange lights typically mean it's connecting. Give that another 30 seconds to establish the connection.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... waiting... (pause) Nope, still no internet light on the modem. The router lights are still orange.

Agent: Still orange, okay. Let me try something else. Can you unplug the power cable on the modem one more time, but this time also unplug the coaxial cable—that's the cable that comes from the wall into the modem. Just the one from the wall.

Customer: The cable from the wall? Like the one that looks like... it has the twist connector?

Agent: That's exactly it, yes.

Customer: Okay, (rustling) I'm unplugging that. I've got the modem unplugged too now.

Agent: Leave both of those unplugged for about 60 seconds. (pause) David, is there any chance you recently had any work done on your line, or did you move things around recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Everything's been the same for... I don't know, months.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Alright, go ahead and reconnect that coaxial cable to the modem first.

Customer: (rustling) Okay, cable's back in.

Agent: And then plug the modem back in.

Customer: (rustling) Modem's plugged in.

Agent: (pause) Let's see what happens. Give it another minute to boot up.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, booting up... (pause) Um, I'm still not seeing that internet light. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand. (typing sounds) I'm going to check something on my end. Can you tell me what model modem you have? It should say something on the front or back of the device.

Customer: (rustling) It says... um... "Frontier Quantum" something... it looks like "Quantum Gateway" maybe?

Agent: Okay, Quantum Gateway. That's good. (pause, typing) I'm looking at your account and... hmm. (pause) It's showing here that... actually, you know what, I want to check one more thing. Can you look at the coaxial cable where it connects to the modem? Is it tight? Sometimes they can work loose.

Customer: (rustling) Let me check... no, it feels pretty tight to me. Seems secure.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Let me put you on hold for just a moment while I check with our network team to see if there's something on our end. This should only take a couple minutes.

Customer: Sure, okay.

Agent: (hold music, then return) Okay, David, I'm back. Unfortunately, the network team is showing a signal issue on the line coming into your building. They're not picking up a strong enough signal from your modem.

Customer: Oh. So what does that mean?

Agent: It means there could be an issue with the line itself, or potentially an issue at the network termination point outside your building. This is typically something we'd need to send a technician out to look at.

Customer: Really? So you can't fix this from here?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. I've run through the standard troubleshooting steps and the signal issue they're seeing on our end indicates this is going to require a physical inspection. I can schedule a technician to come out and take a look at your line.

Customer: (sigh) When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available... What does your schedule look like? Are you typically home during the day?

Customer: I work from home, so I'm here most days. But with my internet being out, I kind of need this fixed pretty soon.

Agent: I completely understand. We do have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or I also have Thursday afternoon from 2 to 6 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better.

Agent: Excellent. I'm going to get you scheduled for tomorrow, 8 to 12 PM window. And David, just to make sure we can reach you if the technician arrives a little early or late, what's the best phone number to use?

Customer: It's 555-0149.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, you're all set. Your service ticket number is 8847-FRN. Your technician will be out tomorrow morning. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I hope so too. We really appreciate your patience, David. If you have any questions before the technician arrives, feel free to give us a call back. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
