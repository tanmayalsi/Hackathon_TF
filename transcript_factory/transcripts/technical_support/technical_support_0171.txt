Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I work from home and I've got meetings coming up.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get back online. First, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. And your name?

Customer: Tom. Tom Richardson.

Agent: Perfect, Tom. So your internet's been down since this morning, you said? Do you have any lights on your modem right now?

Customer: Um, let me look. (pause) Yeah, there's... there's a couple lights on it. The power light is green, I think, and there's like an orange or red light on the side.

Agent: Okay, that orange or red light is what we need to focus on. That typically indicates a connection issue. Can you tell me which light exactly? Is it the one that says "online" or "internet"?

Customer: I'm not really sure. I'm not great with this tech stuff. It's just... it's red or orange colored and it's blinking.

Agent: No problem, Tom. We'll figure this out. The blinking light usually means the modem is trying to connect. Let me have you try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem from the power source?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I'm going to have you wait about 30 seconds before plugging it back in. This is called a power cycle and it helps reset the connection. Just count to thirty for me.

Customer: (counting) One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten... eleven... twelve... thirteen... fourteen... fifteen... sixteen... seventeen... eighteen... nineteen... twenty... twenty-one... twenty-two... twenty-three... twenty-four... twenty-five... twenty-six... twenty-seven... twenty-eight... twenty-nine... thirty.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged in. The lights are... they're coming back on.

Agent: Good. Now we're going to wait a couple minutes for it to fully boot up and establish a connection. While we wait, can you tell me if there have been any storms in your area? Sometimes that can affect the line.

Customer: There was a pretty bad one last night, actually. I remember hearing thunder around two in the morning.

Agent: Okay, that could definitely be a factor. (pause) Let's see... have you tried connecting to the internet yet? Can you check one of your devices?

Customer: Yeah, let me grab my laptop. (pause) Okay, so... no, I'm not seeing the WiFi network. It's not showing up.

Agent: Hmm. The WiFi network isn't broadcasting. That's interesting. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds, longer pause) Tom, I'm looking at your line here and I'm actually not seeing a strong signal coming from the street to your home. It's possible the storm last night damaged the line or a junction box.

Customer: Oh no. So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, I can't fix it remotely, but what I can do is dispatch a technician to your location. Before we do that, though, let me try one more thing. Can you check the back of the modem and make sure all the cables are plugged in securely? There's usually a coax cable and an ethernet cable.

Customer: (background sounds of moving objects) Um, yeah, let me see. There's the power cord, and... yeah, there's a coax cable. It looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: And the other end of that coax cable—do you know where that connects to? Is it in a wall outlet or [inaudible]?

Customer: It comes from the wall, yeah. It's in one of those cable outlet things in the wall.

Agent: Okay, can you disconnect it from the modem and then reconnect it? Just make sure you really tighten it.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I'm tightening it... it's pretty tight now.

Agent: Good. Let's give it another minute or two and see if that helps.

Customer: (pause) Nope. Still nothing. The lights are... still the same blinking red light.

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, based on what I'm seeing here and what we've tried, I believe there's a line issue between the street and your house. The good news is this is something we can absolutely repair, but I will need to get a technician out to you.

Customer: Okay. When can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds, longer pause) Let me check our availability... We have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we also have a window on Thursday afternoon from 1 PM to 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be great. I really need this fixed.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. The technician will text you 30 minutes before arrival. What's the best number to reach you?

Customer: It's the same number you pulled up, 555-0147.

Agent: Got it. And Tom, just to confirm—you're at... (typing sounds) ...1847 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. So we have you all set for tomorrow morning. Is there anything else I can help you with while we're on the line?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I hope you guys can get it fixed quickly. I really can't be without internet.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm confident our technician will take good care of you tomorrow. In the meantime, if you do see any changes with the modem or if it somehow comes back online, just give us a call back. But we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Alright, thanks Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Tom. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
