Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got work stuff I need to do and... it's just not connecting.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's 555-0847. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0847. And can I get a name for the account?

Customer: It's under David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Thanks for that. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was approximately?

Customer: Yeah, I'd say around 7 or 8 AM. I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing was working. I've been without it for a couple hours now.

Agent: Okay, so a few hours. Let me pull up your account here... (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, David, I'm looking at your account now. I do see you have our Fiber 500 service. Before we go through some troubleshooting steps, let me just check our system to see if there are any outages in your area.

Customer: Yeah, that'd be great. I'm in the northeast part of the city.

Agent: (pause) Okay, and I'm checking that zip code now... I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area at this time, so we should be able to get you back up and running. Let's do some quick troubleshooting, alright?

Customer: Sure, go ahead.

Agent: Great. First thing I want you to do is take a look at your modem and router setup. Can you tell me what you're seeing? Are there any lights on them?

Customer: Okay, so... (pause) yeah, I'm looking at them now. The modem has some lights on it. There's like a green light and a red light, I think. And the router... the router's also got lights but I'm not... I'm not totally sure what they're supposed to look like.

Agent: That's okay. So we've got a green light and a red light on the modem. Can you tell me which lights those are? Like, are they on the front of the modem?

Customer: Yeah, they're on the front. Um, let me see... there's a green power light I think, and then there's a red light on the right side. It looks like maybe it says "internet" or something near it?

Agent: Okay, so that red light on the internet port is actually what's concerning. That should be green if everything's working properly. Let me have you try a couple things. First, can you unplug the modem from the power outlet?

Customer: Sure, unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, it's out.

Agent: Great. Just leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds, and while we're waiting, let me ask you—have you made any changes to your setup recently? New equipment, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been working fine up until this morning. I didn't change anything.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful. Okay, why don't you go ahead and plug the modem back in now?

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in... okay, it's back in. Give it a second... (pause) Alright, the lights are coming back on.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give it about a minute to fully boot back up. While that's happening, are you able to see your WiFi network name popping up on your device at all?

Customer: Um... (pause) let me check my phone real quick. (pause) No, I'm not seeing it. I'm not seeing the WiFi network.

Agent: Okay, so the network isn't showing up yet. That's fine, we should give it another 30 seconds or so. Sometimes it takes a minute for everything to come back online after a restart. Go ahead and check again in just a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay... still nothing. The red light is still red too, actually.

Agent: The red light's still red? Okay. Alright, let me have you try something else. Can you check the cable connections on the back of the modem? I want to make sure all the cables are plugged in securely.

Customer: Yeah, I can do that. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at the back here. There's like... (pause) ...there's a coax cable, looks like it's plugged in. There's an ethernet cable. And then the power cable. They all look pretty secure to me.

Agent: Alright, good. Now, one thing you could try is unplugging the coax cable—that's the cable that comes from the wall—and plugging it back in.

Customer: (pause) The coax from the wall? Okay, I'm doing that now. (pause) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: (typing sounds) Good. Let's give that a moment. Check your WiFi network again. Is it showing up?

Customer: (pause) No... still nothing. The red light is still there. This is weird, man. I don't... I don't really know much about this stuff.

Agent: I understand. These things can definitely be frustrating. Let me try one more thing here. I'm going to have you do a factory reset on the modem. Now, this will take a few minutes, but it should clear out any issues. There should be a small reset button on the back of the modem. It might be recessed, so you might need a pen or paperclip to press it.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I see a little button on the back. Do I just... press it?

Agent: Yes, press and hold it for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Holding it... okay... (pause) ...and... releasing. The lights are all going off now.

Agent: That's exactly what should happen. Let's give it a couple minutes to fully reboot. This process takes a little while.

Customer: (long pause) Okay. (pause) Alright, I'm getting some lights back on again. (pause) Green light's back. But the internet light is still... it's still red.

Agent: The internet light is still red?

Customer: Yeah. It came back red just like before.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, that's not what we typically see. (typing sounds) David, let me check something in the system here. (pause) I'm going to have our technical team look at your line remotely. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Sure, okay.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) (pause) Thank you for holding. Alright, so I've got our technical diagnostics running on your line. One second here... (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing some signal issues coming from your ONT—that's the device outside or on your home that connects to our network. 

Customer: Oh, so it's not the modem?

Agent: It could be related to both. The signal we're seeing is below our normal parameters. This typically indicates either a problem with the ONT itself or an issue with the line coming to your home. It's also possible there's a problem with our connection on our end.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can we fix it over the phone?

Agent: Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be able to resolve this remotely. Given what I'm seeing in the diagnostics, I think we need to get a technician out to your location to investigate further. They'll be able to check the outside line and the ONT directly.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest I'm showing is tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sighs) Tomorrow? I mean... I guess it has to. I don't have a choice, right?

Agent: I wish I could get someone out sooner. These types of line issues really do require an on-site visit. But tomorrow afternoon we can definitely get someone out there to take a look. Let me get that scheduled for you.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Fine. Tomorrow.

Agent: Great. And is that phone number still the best way to reach you? The 555-0847?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap, we have a technician visit scheduled for tomorrow, [inaudible] between 12 and 4 PM. They'll check your ONT and the line connection. In the meantime, unfortunately, your internet will likely remain down. Do you have any questions for me?

Customer: No, I think I've got it. Just... hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I certainly hope so too, David. And again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We really do appreciate your patience. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with the appointment details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good rest of your day.
