Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because my internet just went out completely. Like, it's been down for about an hour now and I can't get anything to work.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And what's the best number to reach you at?

Customer: You're calling me on it—it's 555-0892.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet's been down for about an hour. Just to confirm, are you getting any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) yeah, actually. The modem has like, a green light, but the router doesn't have anything. It's all dark.

Agent: Okay, good information. The green light on the modem is actually normal—that means it's powered on. The router being dark is what we're concerned about. Can you check if the power cable is securely plugged into the back of the router?

Customer: (pause) Hold on... (background noise, rustling) Yeah, it's plugged in. I mean, it looks plugged in from where I'm standing, but let me actually... (more rustling) Okay, yeah, it's definitely in there.

Agent: Alright. And do you see any kind of power indicator on the router at all? Even if it's orange or red?

Customer: No, nothing. It's completely black. No lights.

Agent: Let me have you try a couple of things. First, can you unplug the power cable from the back of the router?

Customer: Okay... (pause) done.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about thirty seconds before we plug it back in. This'll do a full restart.

Customer: (pause) Alright... (pause) ...thirty seconds, right?

Agent: That's right. Just count it out if you want. (pause) Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (rustling, plugging sound) Okay, I'm plugging it in now.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and give it about two minutes to fully boot back up. While we're waiting, do you remember if there were any power outages in your area recently, or did anything happen before the internet went down?

Customer: (pause) No, nothing that I noticed. I was just working from home and everything was fine and then suddenly the WiFi just disappeared. No power outage though.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. (pause) So about two minutes should be up now. What are you seeing on the router?

Customer: Um... (pause) I'm getting a green light on the left side, but the one on the right is amber or orange or something. That wasn't there before.

Agent: Okay, so a green and an amber light is actually... (pause) that's usually a sign that the router is trying to sync with the modem. It should fully boot up in just another minute or so. Can you give it one more minute?

Customer: Sure, I can wait. (pause) One more minute...

Agent: (pause) Alright, how's it looking now?

Customer: (pause) Umm, still the same. Green and orange.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm. Let me check something on my end. (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing a connection from your router to our network. The modem is registering, but the router isn't syncing. Can you tell me what model of router you have? There should be a label on the back.

Customer: (rustling) Let me see here... it says... Frontier... something... (pause) Netgear? Or is that... yeah, Netgear. N-E-T-G-E-A-R.

Agent: Okay, Netgear. Do you see any other model information on there? Like an N-whatever number?

Customer: (pause) I'm not really seeing it clearly. I'm getting older and the print is tiny. (chuckles) Can you... I don't know, can't you just reset it or something from your end?

Agent: I wish I could. Unfortunately, the router needs to establish that connection first. Let me try something else. Can you unplug the modem as well now? Just temporarily.

Customer: The modem too? Okay... (pause, rustling) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now let's leave both of those unplugged for about two minutes this time. We want to do a full reset of both devices.

Customer: (pause) Both of them just sitting there unplugged?

Agent: Exactly.

Customer: (pause) Okay, this is... this is frustrating. I have a work meeting in like twenty minutes.

Agent: I understand, and I'm going to do everything I can to get you back online. I know this is inconvenient. (pause) Go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause, rustling, plugging sound) Okay, modem's back in.

Agent: Now give that about forty-five seconds to fully boot up before you plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright... (pause) seems like forever when you're in a hurry, you know?

Agent: Yeah, I totally get it. (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: (rustling, plugging sound) Done.

Agent: Alright, let's give it two minutes again to fully sync up.

(extended pause)

Agent: Still there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here. Just staring at these lights trying to will them to turn green.

Agent: (chuckles) Fair enough. (pause) How we looking now?

Customer: (pause) Same thing as before. Green on the modem, green and orange on the router. It's not changing.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let me check the line status on my end. (typing sounds, longer pause) I'm seeing... (pause) actually, I'm not picking up a signal from the modem itself now. That's strange.

Customer: What do you mean you're not picking it up?

Agent: Let me have you try one more thing. Can you check the cable that goes from the modem into the wall outlet? The coaxial cable?

Customer: (pause) The cable coming out of the wall?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Can you see if that's firmly connected?

Customer: (rustling) Yeah, I mean it looks pretty connected to me. I'm not a tech person though, so...

Agent: I know, I know. Try giving it a quarter turn clockwise, just to make sure it's snug.

Customer: (rustling, pause) Okay... I did that. (pause) Now what?

Agent: Now let's check if we're getting a signal. Give me about thirty seconds and then look at the modem again.

Customer: (pause) Is it supposed to reboot or something?

Agent: It might. Just keep an eye on it.

(pause)

Customer: No, nothing's happening. Same lights as before.

Agent: Okay. (pause, typing sounds) So, I'm not picking up any connection from your address right now, and that's unusual. Let me ask you this—is there any chance there was any work being done in your area? Like, any construction or anything like that recently?

Customer: Not that I saw. I mean, I don't really pay attention to that kind of stuff.

Agent: Understandable. Here's what I think might be happening. It's possible the signal isn't reaching your modem properly from our network. That could be a line issue on our end.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it something you guys need to come fix?

Agent: Let me try a couple more things before we go down that road. (pause) Can you do me a favor and restart your modem one more time? I'm going to watch it on my end and see if we pick up any kind of signal.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, unplugging the modem again...

Agent: (pause) Yep, I'm clearing the connection on my end too.

Customer: (pause, rustling, plugging sound) Okay, plugging back in.

Agent: (pause) Alright, watching... (pause) ...still nothing. Let me try initiating a signal from my side. (typing sounds, pause) How about now?

Customer: (pause) Nothing. Still the same.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I'm looking at the line diagnostics here and I'm actually seeing an issue on our network side. The signal strength is really low coming to your address.

Customer: So... you're saying it's a problem on your end?

Agent: It looks like it could be, yes. There could be a few different things causing this—it could be an issue with the line connection at the network hub in your area, or there could be a problem with the connection at our equipment facility. Without being able to troubleshoot it remotely, I'm going to need to get a technician out to your location.

Customer: (pause) When can they come? Like, I need this today if possible.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) We do have availability for a technician visit today. The earliest we can get someone out there is between 2 and 5 PM. Does that work for your schedule?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess that'll have to work. My meeting's at 10, so maybe I can find a workaround for the morning.

Agent: Great. Let me get some information for the technician visit. Can I get the best contact number again?

Customer: It's 555-0892.

Agent: And the service address is what's on file here—555 Maple Street, Apartment 3B?

Customer: That's correct, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to schedule a technician visit for today between 2 and 5 PM. Someone will come take a look at the line and get to the bottom of why the signal isn't reaching your modem. Is there anything else I can help you with, or do you have any questions?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it today.

Agent: I understand, and hopefully they will. The technician should be able to determine what's going on pretty quickly once they're on-site. You should receive a confirmation text within the next few minutes with the appointment details.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone, but we'll get you back online as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: Alright, thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
