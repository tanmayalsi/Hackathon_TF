# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and everything.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! We'll get this sorted out for you. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up here... I see your account. Your name is Robert?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So your internet went down about an hour ago. Just to confirm, you've already unplugged the modem—did you wait a couple minutes before plugging it back in?

Customer: Yeah, I did. I waited like three minutes and it came back on, but it was really slow, and then it just died completely.

Agent: Okay, I see. And right now, when you look at your modem, what color are the lights on it?

Customer: Um... (pause) the power light is green, but the internet light—I think it's the one with the little globe—that one's red.

Agent: The red light, okay. That tells me the modem isn't getting a signal from our network. That's actually pretty common. Let me just do a quick reset on the modem from here. (typing sounds) I'm going to do a remote reboot. This should take about two minutes. Can you just keep the modem plugged in and we'll see if that helps?

Customer: Okay, I'll wait.

Agent: (pause) Alright, the reboot is processing. While we wait, have you had any weather out that way recently? Any storms or anything?

Customer: Uh, no, actually the weather's been pretty nice all week. Why?

Agent: Oh, just checking. Sometimes we see outages related to weather damage on the lines, but if you haven't had anything like that, we can rule that out. (pause) Okay, the reboot should be completing here in a moment...

Customer: I'm still seeing that red light.

Agent: Still red? Hmm. Okay, no problem. Let me try something different. Can you unplug the modem one more time for me, but this time I want you to also unplug the router if you have one separate from the modem?

Customer: Okay, there's a separate router. You want both unplugged?

Agent: Yes, both of them. Just for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright, unplugging... (pause) okay, both are unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now just wait about thirty seconds... (pause) ...and now go ahead and plug the modem back in first. Wait until you see that internet light, then plug the router in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the modem's back in... (pause) ...the lights are cycling... (pause) okay, the internet light is—oh, it's still red.

Agent: (pause) Still red?

Customer: Yeah. I mean, it's not even blinking or anything. It's just solid red.

Agent: Okay, I'm looking at your connection here and we're not detecting any signal coming to your modem from our end. This might indicate an issue with either the line coming into your home or possibly the modem itself. Robert, how long have you had that modem with us?

Customer: Um, I'd say like... three years? Maybe four?

Agent: And this is the first real issue you've had with it?

Customer: Yeah, it's been working fine until today.

Agent: Okay. Well, what I'd like to do is check on the line. Can you tell me—do you have a battery backup on your modem or any surge protector?

Customer: It's just plugged into the wall directly.

Agent: Alright, that's fine. Let me check something on the line side. (typing sounds, pause) Robert, I'm running a diagnostic on the connection to your address and... hmm, that's interesting. I'm seeing some inconsistencies on the signal. This could mean there's an issue on our infrastructure side, or there could be a problem with the line running to your house.

Customer: So what does that mean? How do we fix it?

Agent: That's a really good question. Normally what we'd do is send a technician out to your location to physically inspect the lines and the equipment. They'd be able to pinpoint exactly where the issue is. But I do want to try one more thing before we go down that route, if that's okay with you?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: Can you check your outlets? Is the outlet you're plugged into working? Like, try plugging something else in there—a lamp or something—just to make sure it's not a power issue.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm plugging in my desk lamp and... yeah, the lamp works fine. The outlet's good.

Agent: Good. Alright, and your modem's back in that same outlet?

Customer: Yeah, same outlet.

Agent: Okay. (pause) I'm going to try one more reboot from our end, but I have to be honest with you, given what I'm seeing on the line diagnostics, I don't think this is going to resolve it. But let's try anyway.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) Initiating another reboot now... (pause, longer pause) ...alright, let's give that about ninety seconds to complete. What are you seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Red light still. Nothing's changed.

Agent: (sigh) Alright, Robert. I've tried the remote reboots and we've done the manual reset, but the issue persists. The diagnostics are telling me there's something on the line that's preventing your modem from establishing a connection to our network. This really does require a technician visit to diagnose properly.

Customer: Okay... so when could someone come out?

Agent: Good question. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) So I can get a technician out there... it looks like we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM, or we have some slots on Thursday morning as well. What works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow's fine. I can be there.

Agent: Excellent. Before I set that up, I just need to let you know—if the issue is determined to be on your end, like with the modem or your internal wiring, there would be a service call fee of $99. However, if it's determined to be on our infrastructure side, there's no charge.

Customer: Okay, I understand.

Agent: Alright, let me get you all set up. Your service appointment is scheduled for tomorrow from 8 AM to 5 PM. The technician will arrive and diagnose the issue. They'll have all your account information. Is there a phone number where we can reach you if the technician needs to confirm their arrival time?

Customer: 555-0147—that's the same number as before.

Agent: Perfect. Actually, I'm seeing that's the account phone number. Do you have a cell number as well? That way the technician can call you directly.

Customer: Oh, yeah, it's 555-0289.

Agent: (typing sounds) Excellent. I've got that down. So to recap, Robert, you've got a technician visit tomorrow, 8 AM to 5 PM. We'll have your account pulled up and they'll be able to diagnose what's happening with your internet connection. In the meantime, if you want to try anything else—and I know we've already done a lot—you could try a factory reset on the modem, but honestly, I don't think it'll change anything given what the diagnostics are showing.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate your help. I guess I'll just wait for the technician tomorrow.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get you back online today, but I'm confident the technician will be able to figure this out for you. Is there anything else I can help you with before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: No problem, Robert. Thanks for calling Frontier and sorry again for the trouble. You have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
