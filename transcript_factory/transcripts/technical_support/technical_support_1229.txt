Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I see you're on our fiber service in the Riverside area. And you're saying your internet is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. No connection at all. The modem's been like this since around 8 this morning.

Agent: Alright, let's get this sorted out for you. First thing—can you tell me what you're seeing on your modem right now? Is it powered on?

Customer: Yeah, it's powered on. All the lights are lit up, I think... (pause) Yeah, there's like a blue light and a red light that's blinking.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing a blue light and a red light blinking. The red blinking light typically indicates an issue with the connection. Let me try a couple things on my end first. Have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, definitely. Go ahead and unplug it for about 30 seconds and then plug it back in. That'll do a hard reset. While you're doing that, I'll check if there are any service issues in your area.

Customer: (background noise of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged. I'm gonna wait... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great. Go ahead and give it about a minute or two to fully boot back up. While we wait, let me check the system here. Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area, so that's good news.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so it's back on now. Still showing that red blinking light though.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That red light is still concerning. Can you walk me over to the back of your modem? There should be an ethernet cable plugged into it. Can you check if that cable is seated properly?

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I see it. It looks like it's... it's plugged in pretty tight, I think.

Agent: And can you see where that cable connects at the other end? Does it go into a wall jack or anything?

Customer: Oh yeah, it goes into a wall jack. Hold on, let me look at the connection. (pause) It seems fine to me. It's plugged in.

Agent: Okay, just to be thorough, can you unplug that ethernet cable and plug it back in? Sometimes the connection can get a little loose.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (background noise of unplugging) Okay, plugging it back in... (pause) There. Done.

Agent: Alright. Any change on the modem lights?

Customer: (pause) Um... no, the red light's still blinking.

Agent: Okay. Let me check something else. Can you tell me what model modem you have? It should say on the front or back of the unit.

Customer: (pause) It says... looks like a Frontier-issued... uh, the model is... (pause) I'm having trouble reading it. There's a lot of numbers. It's a white box, if that helps.

Agent: No problem. I can look this up based on your service address. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm checking your modem specifications. Let me ask you this—when you look at the ethernet port on the wall jack, do you see any of the indicator lights around it?

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) Yeah, actually there are some lights around it. There's like a green light.

Agent: Is the green light steady or blinking?

Customer: It's... it's not really doing anything. It's kind of dim. Is that bad?

Agent: Well, that could indicate an issue with the line itself. Let me put you on a brief hold while I run a line test from here. It should only take a minute or two.

Customer: Sure, okay.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Thank you for holding. Okay, I've run a diagnostic on your line and I'm actually getting a signal, so the infrastructure seems fine on our end. This is pointing toward either an issue with the modem itself or possibly a problem with the connection at the wall jack. Have you had any storms recently, or any power surges?

Customer: (pause) No, not that I know of. It was working fine yesterday.

Agent: Alright. Let me try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem, wait about a minute, and then—actually, while it's unplugged, can you also disconnect that ethernet cable from the wall and look inside the jack? Just visually, is anything loose or disconnected in there?

Customer: (background noise) Okay, modem's unplugged... (pause) Looking at the wall jack. Um... I don't really know what I'm looking at, to be honest. [inaudible]... there's some wires in there?

Agent: Yeah, there should be some wires. They should be color-coded. Do they all look like they're... well, do you see any wires that look damaged or pulled out?

Customer: No, they all look pretty much connected. They're all color-coded like you said.

Agent: Okay, good. Go ahead and plug the modem back in now and let's see if anything's changed.

Customer: (background noise) Plugging it in... (pause) Okay. (pause) Still the same. Red light blinking, no internet.

Agent: Yeah... (pause) Look, I've run through all the standard troubleshooting steps, and unfortunately I'm not able to resolve this remotely. This could be an issue with the modem hardware itself, or there might be a problem with our line connection that requires an in-person technician visit.

Customer: So... what does that mean? How long would that take?

Agent: Let me check our technician availability. (typing sounds) Okay, so depending on your location, we can typically schedule a technician visit within 24 to 48 hours. However, I can also get you a replacement modem sent out, which would take about 3 to 5 business days.

Customer: (pause) So I'm basically without internet for the next couple days either way?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. But if you want, I can set up a technician visit for tomorrow or the next day, and if it's a hardware issue, we can get you back up and running right away. Or if you'd prefer, we can send you a replacement modem to try, and if it works, then we know it was the device.

Customer: I... I really need internet for work. Can't you, like, expedite anything?

Agent: I understand, and I'm sorry about this. Let me see if there's anything else... (pause) Okay, so the earliest I can get a technician to you is tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess that'll have to work. Tomorrow afternoon.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. And just to confirm, this is at 555 Oak Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So we'll have a technician out tomorrow, and I'm gonna make a note here that the red light on your modem won't turn off and you're experiencing a complete loss of connection. If that technician can't resolve it on-site, we'll get that replacement modem to you as quickly as possible.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, thank you. I don't like it, but... yeah.

Agent: I know, and again, I'm sorry you're going through this. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright. You should receive a confirmation text and email with your appointment details. Is there a preferred contact number for the technician?

Customer: The number I called from is fine.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll get this taken care of for you tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, thanks for trying. I appreciate it.

Agent: Of course. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
