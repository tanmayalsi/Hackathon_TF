# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Marcus. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I totally understand how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your phone number or account number, please?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I've got you here. So your service address is 2341 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Okay, great. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have you had any power outages or storms in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The power's been fine all day. I woke up this morning and just... nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Alright. And just to clarify—you're not seeing any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, let me look. (pause) The modem's got a red light on it. Like, it's just... red. Not blinking or anything.

Agent: Okay, red light. That's helpful. That typically means there's no connection being detected. Let's try some basic troubleshooting first. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Sure, doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And while we're waiting, let me ask—have you noticed any damage to the cable line outside? Any loose wires or anything that looks out of place?

Customer: I haven't really looked, but... I mean, I don't know what I'd be looking for.

Agent: That's fair. We can check on that in a second. First, go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugging back in now. I see the lights coming back up. (pause) There's white, then yellow, and now... still red. It's still red, Marcus.

Agent: Still red, okay. That's... hmm. Let me just check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your service line here, and it actually shows as active on our end. So the issue might be at your equipment or with the physical line to your house.

Customer: So what does that mean? What do I do?

Agent: Well, here's what I want to try. Let me walk you through resetting your modem completely. This is different from just unplugging it. I want you to hold down the reset button on the back of the device for about ten seconds. It's usually a small button you might need to use a pen or something to press.

Customer: The reset button... okay, I'm looking. Yeah, I see it. (pause) I'm holding it down... ten seconds... and... okay, I'm releasing it.

Agent: Perfect. Now we're gonna let it boot back up. This should take about two to three minutes. Can you give it a minute or so and then tell me what you see?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. The lights are cycling through again. Yellow... (longer pause) ...still yellow. It's been like thirty seconds now.

Agent: That's normal. It takes a little time. Let's give it another minute.

Customer: (pause, background noise of waiting) Okay... still yellow. Is that... is that good?

Agent: Yellow usually means it's trying to sync. So that's actually... that's a decent sign, yeah. Let me check something over here. (typing sounds) I'm gonna reboot your line from my end.

Customer: Okay, um... (pause) ...oh, the light just went out.

Agent: It went out completely?

Customer: Yeah, now it's dark. Like, all of them are off. Is that bad?

Agent: It shouldn't be. It's probably responding to the reboot I just sent. Give it another minute to come back up.

Customer: Alright. (long pause) Okay, lights are coming back... there's white... still white... (pause) ...now there's a little green one.

Agent: Oh! You're getting a green light? That's good! That's progress. Is the green light staying steady or is it blinking?

Customer: It's, um... (pause) ...it looks like it's blinking? But the others are still... there's red ones over here too.

Agent: [inaudible] Okay, so we might have partial connectivity. Can you try opening a browser on your computer and see if you can load any website? Anything at all.

Customer: (pause) Let me grab my laptop. (pause) Okay, opening Chrome now... (longer pause) ...nothing. The page won't load. It's still trying to load and... nope, timeout error.

Agent: Alright, so we don't have internet access quite yet. Let me... (typing sounds) ...let me take another look here at what's happening on the backend. Can you tell me if you're seeing any lights that are solid green on the modem now?

Customer: Um, no. Like I said, it's mostly red. There's one that's like green or yellow, I can't quite tell in this light...

Agent: Can you maybe move the modem somewhere brighter or pull it closer so you can see it better?

Customer: (pause) Oh, yeah, okay. Moving it now. (pause) Yeah, so it's definitely a blinking green light. And the rest are red.

Agent: Okay, blinking green. That's... that's telling me that the modem is registering on our network, but it's not getting a downstream signal. That usually points to either a line issue or potentially a modem issue, but given that this just happened today, I'm suspecting it might be something external.

Customer: So like... what does that mean I need to do?

Agent: Well, I want to try one more thing before we go further. I'm gonna send a refresh signal to your modem. It's gonna take just a few seconds. And then I want you to pay close attention to those lights, okay?

Customer: Okay. (pause) Okay, doing it... (pause) Lights went out again for a second. Now they're coming back... (longer pause) ...same as before. Red lights, one blinking green.

Agent: Alright, yeah, we're still seeing the same issue. I've tried the resets and the refresh, and the modem keeps trying to connect but it's not getting the signal it needs. At this point, I'm pretty confident the issue is either with the line coming into your house or with the modem itself having an issue that's preventing it from fully syncing.

Customer: So what happens now? Can you send someone out?

Agent: Yes, actually, that's what I recommend. We can definitely schedule a technician to come out and diagnose this. They can check the line, potentially replace the modem if it's defective, and get you back online. Unfortunately, the earliest we have available is... (typing sounds) ...actually, looks like tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Seriously? Tomorrow? I need internet today. I have work I need to do.

Agent: I completely understand the urgency. Let me see... (typing sounds) ...unfortunately, all our same-day appointments are booked. It's been pretty busy today. But I can flag this as priority so when the technician comes out tomorrow, they'll know it's urgent.

Customer: This is really not ideal, Marcus.

Agent: I know, and I'm genuinely sorry. I wish I had a same-day slot available. But I promise the technician will get you taken care of as quickly as possible. And hey, in the meantime, is there any way you could use mobile hotspot from your phone? At least for the urgent work stuff?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess I could. But my data's limited.

Agent: I get it. Well, just to recap—I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM window. A technician will come by, and they'll troubleshoot and fix whatever's going on. Does that all sound good?

Customer: I mean, it's not great, but... yeah, I guess that's what we're doing.

Agent: Alright. Is there a good number to reach you at if they need to confirm or if there's any delay?

Customer: The number you already have should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. I've got that in the system. You should get a confirmation email and possibly a text as well. And again, I really do apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get you back up and running tomorrow.

Customer: Okay. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for your patience, and we really do appreciate your business with Frontier. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
