Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of. It's just completely down.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm showing an account under... is this Michael Harrison?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're having no internet connectivity at all right now?

Customer: Right. I've got like, zero signal. Usually I can at least see the lights on the modem, but right now nothing. It's all dark.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful to know. So the modem appears to be completely powered down. Let's start with the basics. Can you check and make sure the power cable is firmly connected to the modem? It should be plugged in both to the device and to the wall outlet.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. It's... it's plugged in.

Agent: Great. And the outlet itself—is that outlet working? Do you have another device you could plug in to test it?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, let me try the lamp that's on the table. (pause) Okay, I plugged the lamp in and... no, it's not coming on either.

Agent: Ah, so the outlet isn't working. That would explain it.

Customer: Right? So I can just plug it into a different outlet?

Agent: Exactly. Yeah, try plugging both the modem and your router—if you have a separate router—into a different outlet.

Customer: (pause) Okay, okay... I'm going to move this. (background noise) Alright, so I've got the modem plugged into the outlet in the hallway. (pause) It's... it's still not coming on.

Agent: Hmm. It may take a moment to power up. Give it about 30 seconds or so and see if you see any lights coming on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm waiting... (pause) Still nothing. That's weird.

Agent: Okay, let's try something else. Do you have another modem you could test with, or—actually, you know what, let me check on our end. I'm going to see if there are any outages in your area or any issues with your line.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Let me pull that up... (pause) Alright, so I'm not seeing any outages reported in the 94110 area. Your service appears to be active on our end. (pause) The issue seems to be with the modem itself. Did you have any storms recently? Or any power surges?

Customer: Actually, yeah. There was some lightning last night. I didn't even think about that.

Agent: That could very well be it. Lightning strikes can sometimes damage the modem or the power supply. Since you've tried a different outlet and it's still not powering on, I think we might be looking at a hardware failure. Here's what I'd like to do. We have a couple of options. I can send a technician out to your location to diagnose and replace the modem if needed. Or, if you'd prefer, we can mail you a replacement modem and walk you through the setup.

Customer: How long would that take? The technician, I mean?

Agent: We could typically get someone out there within the next 2 to 3 business days.

Customer: (pause) And the modem in the mail?

Agent: That usually takes about 5 to 7 business days to arrive, though you'd need to install it yourself, but I'd be happy to walk you through that.

Customer: Okay, um... I think I'd rather have a technician come out. I'm not really tech-savvy and I don't want to mess anything up.

Agent: That's completely understandable. Let me get some information from you. Are you available during business hours—that's 8 AM to 6 PM—next Tuesday through Thursday?

Customer: Tuesday or Wednesday should work. Thursday might be tight.

Agent: Alright, I'll note that you prefer Tuesday or Wednesday. (typing sounds) And do you have a working phone number where we can reach you to confirm the appointment?

Customer: It's 555-0148.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) So I've set up a technician visit for next Tuesday between 8 AM and 6 PM. You should receive a confirmation call or email within 24 hours with a more specific time window. Does that sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that works. But is there... is there anything I can do in the meantime? Like, is there any way to get internet before then?

Agent: Unfortunately, with the modem completely unresponsive, there's not much we can do remotely. Without power to the modem, we can't establish a connection. If you have mobile hotspot available on your phone, that could be a temporary workaround.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I do have that, I guess.

Agent: That might help you get by until the technician gets out. And Michael, I apologize for the inconvenience. I know being without internet is really disruptive.

Customer: Yeah, it is. But okay, I appreciate your help. So I'll just wait for the technician to call and confirm?

Agent: Exactly. They'll reach out within 24 hours. The ticket number for your service visit is 447829—do you want me to repeat that?

Customer: Um, sure. What was it?

Agent: 447829.

Customer: 447829. Got it.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
