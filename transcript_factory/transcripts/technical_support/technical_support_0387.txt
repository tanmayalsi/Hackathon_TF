# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. Can I get your name and account number please?

Customer: Yeah, hi. My name is Tom Richardson. Um, my account number is... (pause) ...let me find that real quick. It's 847-555-0234.

Agent: Perfect, Tom. I've got your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Aurora area. What's going on today?

Customer: Yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago. Like, completely down. I tried unplugging the modem, waiting a few minutes, plugging it back in, but nothing's happening. I've got nothing right now.

Agent: Okay, I understand how frustrating that is. Let me help you troubleshoot this. First, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your modem right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...okay so I'm looking at it. The power light is on—that's green. But the internet light, the one that's usually blue? It's red.

Agent: Alright, the red light on the internet connection tells me there might be a connection issue. And when you say it just went out, did you have any storms in your area recently? Any power outages?

Customer: No, no storms or anything. It was working fine this morning, and then around 3 o'clock it just... died.

Agent: Got it. Okay, Tom, I want you to try something for me. Can you unplug the modem from power, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in? I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (sound of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) ...waiting... (pause) ...alright, 30 seconds. Plugging it back in now. (sound of plugging in)

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about two minutes for it to fully reboot. While that's happening, can you tell me—do you have a modem and router combo unit, or are they separate?

Customer: They're separate. I've got the modem that Frontier gave me, and then I've got my own router hooked up to it.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. (typing sounds) And just so I know, when you say the internet went out, were you able to see the network at all, or did the WiFi just disappear completely?

Customer: The WiFi just... it was gone. And I couldn't even see the Frontier network anymore either.

Agent: Alright, let's check the modem lights again. Are they any different now?

Customer: (pause) Um... no, it's still the same. Power is green, internet light is still red. That's... that doesn't seem good, does it?

Agent: Not necessarily. Sometimes these things take a little longer. Let's give it another minute or two. In the meantime, can you see if there's a small reset button on the modem? It's usually recessed.

Customer: Yeah, there's a little hole on the back. Should I press it?

Agent: Actually, let's hold off on that for just a second. Let me check our systems here to see if we're having any outages in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any outages on our end, which is good news and bad news, I guess. It means the issue is likely with your equipment or the line coming into your house.

Customer: Oh, okay. So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, let's try one more thing before we move forward. Can you unplug the cable that goes from the wall into your modem? Just the cable, not the power.

Customer: The coaxial cable?

Agent: Yes, exactly.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. I can see it now. There's no kind of... (inaudible) ...anything blocking it.

Agent: Good. Now plug it back in nice and firmly.

Customer: (sound of connection) Done. Should I wait again?

Agent: Yeah, let's give it about a minute this time. (pause) And while we wait, I'm looking at your account—I see you've had service with us for about three years now. Have you had any issues like this before?

Customer: No, never. It's usually pretty solid actually.

Agent: That's great to hear. Okay, Tom, check the modem lights again for me.

Customer: (pause) Still red. Still just the power light that's green.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Let me try something else here. Can you check if the coaxial cable is screwed in all the way? Sometimes if it's not tight enough, it can cause connection issues.

Customer: (pause) Let me see... I'm trying to tighten it... (sounds of adjusting) Yeah, it didn't seem like it was fully tight. I'm giving it another turn.

Agent: Perfect. Let's wait about another minute or two and see if that helps.

Customer: Okay. (long pause) ...anything yet?

Agent: Let's check now. What are you seeing?

Customer: Nope. (pause) Still the same. Red light. Nothing.

Agent: I wish I had better news for you, Tom. At this point, it seems like either the modem itself might be having an issue, or there could be a problem with the line coming from outside into your house. I want to be honest with you—I think we're going to need to send a technician out to take a look at this in person.

Customer: Really? How long does that take? I really need my internet back. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm showing we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have a later slot at 3 PM to 6 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow at 8 AM should work. But... is there anything else we can try right now? I mean, I could try that reset button we talked about earlier?

Agent: You know what, we can try that. That might actually reset the modem to factory settings. Just be aware that if it works, you're going to have to set up your WiFi and everything again.

Customer: Alright, let me do it. (sound of poking, beeping noise) Okay, I pressed it, and... (pause) ...now it's like, all the lights are flashing. Is that normal?

Agent: Yes, that's normal. That means it's resetting. Let's give it about three to five minutes to fully reboot from the reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'll wait. (long pause) ...anything?

Agent: What are the lights showing now?

Customer: Um, they're still flashing. Wait, no—the power light is solid green again, but the internet light is... (pause) ...still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay, Tom. I think at this point, we've done what we can from here. I'm going to get you scheduled with a technician for tomorrow at 8 AM. They'll be able to come out, check the modem, and inspect the external line to figure out what's going on.

Customer: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Is there a charge for that, or...?

Agent: Since this is your first service call, there's no charge for the visit. The technician will let you know if they need to replace any equipment, and we can discuss that at that time.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate it.

Agent: I'm going to send you a confirmation text and email with the appointment details. The technician's window is between 8 AM and 12 PM. Is your phone number 720-555-0891?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. I'm sending that over now. (typing sounds) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just hoping they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I understand. I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved today, Tom. Our technician is really going to be able to help. Is there a good number to reach you if they need to contact you before they arrive?

Customer: The number you just confirmed is fine.

Agent: Great. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I'm sorry again for the trouble today. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for your help.

Agent: Thank you, Tom. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
