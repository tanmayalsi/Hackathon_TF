# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out completely about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got work calls coming in and I really need this fixed.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you taken care of. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm showing an account here for David Chen at 4821 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage. When exactly did this start?

Customer: Like I said, about an hour ago. I was just working from home, everything was fine, and then suddenly the connection just dropped. My whole house is down. The modem's still got lights on it, so it's not completely dead, but nothing's connecting.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me ask you a few troubleshooting questions. First, can you look at your modem for me? What color are the lights on the front?

Customer: Um... (pause) okay, so I'm looking at it now. There's a green light on the power indicator, and then there's... there's an orange light that keeps blinking on one of the other ones.

Agent: Orange, okay. That light you're seeing—is it the one that says "internet" or is it maybe the one labeled "ethernet"?

Customer: Uh... (pause) I think it says... I'm not entirely sure. It's kind of small print. But the orange one is definitely blinking.

Agent: No problem. An orange or amber light blinking on the internet indicator typically means the modem is having trouble connecting to our network. Here's what I want you to do first—can you unplug the modem from the power? Just pull the power cable right out.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Done.

Agent: Great. Now, while that's unplugged, let's also do the same with your router if you have one separately.

Customer: Oh, okay. Yeah, I've got one. (pause) Alright, both are unplugged now.

Agent: Perfect. Can you just wait about thirty seconds for me? This will reset everything and hopefully clear out whatever's causing the issue.

Customer: (pause) Okay... yeah, I'm waiting.

Agent: (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first. The power cable.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged it back in. Now I'm just... watching it boot up.

Agent: Take your time. It should take maybe a minute or two to fully power on and connect. While we wait, let me ask—have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or has this been working fine up until today?

Customer: No, everything's been working great. This is totally out of the blue. No warning or anything.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. (pause) So how are those lights looking now?

Customer: Um... okay, so the power light is green again, but that orange light... (pause) it's still blinking. Still blinking orange.

Agent: Still blinking, okay. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any service disruptions in your area, and our network is showing good. Let me have you plug the router back in now, and then we'll see what happens.

Customer: Alright. (pause) It's back in. Should I wait for it to boot up too?

Agent: Yeah, give it about thirty to forty-five seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's on now. Got all the lights back up.

Agent: And can you check if you're seeing any networks available to connect to from your phone or computer?

Customer: Yeah, let me... (pause) okay, I'm looking at my laptop. I can see my Wi-Fi network listed, so that's a good sign.

Agent: That is good. Go ahead and try connecting to it for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, trying to connect... (pause) hmm. It says it's connecting but it's not... it's not actually connecting. It just keeps spinning.

Agent: It's just spinning and not connecting. Okay, um... (pause) Let me ask you something—when the internet went out, did you notice any weather or any physical changes around your modem or your external equipment?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been clear all day. No storms or anything.

Agent: Alright. Let me put you on a brief hold while I escalate this to our technical team. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure. How long do you think this will take?

Agent: Shouldn't be more than a minute or two. I just want to see if we're detecting anything on our line to your house.

(hold music plays)

Agent: (returns) Okay, I'm back. So I'm checking our network diagnostics and I'm not seeing any signal coming from your modem at all, which is strange because you're telling me the lights are on and it's powered up.

Customer: Right, the lights are definitely on. I can see them.

Agent: Let me have you try something else. Can you go ahead and restart the modem one more time, but this time hold down the reset button for about ten seconds?

Customer: The reset button? Um... (pause) I'm looking for it... I think I see it. It's the little button on the back?

Agent: Yes, that's the one. It might be recessed, so you might need something small like a pen or a paperclip to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I've got a pen. (pause) Pressing it now. (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... holding it... (pause) and released.

Agent: Good. Now give it about two to three minutes to fully reboot and reestablish connection. This might take a little longer than the last time.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm waiting. How long do you think before we know if this works?

Agent: Should be pretty clear in a couple minutes. In the meantime, I do want to let you know that if this doesn't resolve the issue, we may be looking at a hardware failure or a line problem on our end, which would require a technician to come out and take a look.

Customer: Oh man, I don't really have time for a technician visit today. I've got back-to-back meetings.

Agent: I completely understand. Let's see if we can get this working before we go down that road. How are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the power is green again, but... (pause) that same orange light is back. It's blinking orange again.

Agent: [inaudible] still blinking. Okay. Let me check our diagnostics one more time. (typing sounds) (pause) Yeah, so I'm still not picking up any signal from your modem on our end, which tells me there might be an issue with the modem itself or potentially with the line coming into your house. 

Customer: What does that mean? Is the modem broken?

Agent: It could be. Or it could mean there's a connectivity issue on the line itself. The orange light indicates your modem is trying to connect but can't complete the handshake with our network. Without a technician being able to physically check the line and possibly swap out equipment, it's difficult for me to pinpoint the exact issue from here.

Customer: So what are my options then?

Agent: Well, your best option would be to schedule a technician visit. They can come out, check all the connections, test the line, and if needed, replace the modem. I can schedule that for you right now if you'd like.

Customer: And how soon can they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what availability we have. (pause) The earliest I can get someone to you would be tomorrow morning between 8 and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow morning? I really needed this fixed today.

Agent: I know, and I'm sorry about that. Unfortunately, we don't have any availability for today, and based on the diagnostics, this really does need an in-person visit. What I can do is make sure we prioritize your appointment and get a senior technician out to you first thing.

Customer: (sigh) Yeah... okay. I guess that's the best I can do then.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me go ahead and set that up for you. That would be tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. I'll have them call you about thirty minutes before they arrive, and they'll bring a replacement modem just in case that's what we're dealing with.

Customer: Okay. Can I get a confirmation number or something?

Agent: Absolutely. Your appointment number is TFS-8847291. I'm also going to email you a confirmation with all the details, including a direct number you can call if you need to reschedule. Is the email on file still current?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. I haven't changed it.

Agent: Perfect. Just to recap, you have a technician visit scheduled for tomorrow morning between 8 and noon at 4821 Maple Street. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I guess I'll just have to wait until tomorrow.

Agent: I really do apologize that we couldn't get this resolved remotely today. Hopefully, the technician will have you back up and running first thing tomorrow morning. Thank you for calling Frontier, and I apologize again for the inconvenience.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day. Bye now.
