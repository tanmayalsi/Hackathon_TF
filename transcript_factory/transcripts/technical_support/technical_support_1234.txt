# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, David. I'm pulling up your account now. So your internet service went down about an hour ago, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, around 1 o'clock. One minute it was fine and the next, just... nothing. No lights, no connection, nothing.

Agent: Okay, and have you noticed any issues leading up to this? Like slowness or disconnections?

Customer: No, no, it was working perfectly fine this morning. This just happened all of a sudden.

Agent: Alright. Let's walk through some basic troubleshooting steps. First, can you tell me what you're seeing on your modem right now? Are there any lights on it at all?

Customer: Um, let me go look at it. (pause) No lights. Nothing. It's completely dark.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. What we're going to do is perform a hard reset on your modem. Can you locate the power cable on the back of the unit?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. Do I just... pull it out?

Agent: Exactly. Go ahead and unplug it from the wall outlet.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait for about thirty seconds while it fully powers down. Let's give it a moment here.

Customer: (pause) Alright.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) It's back in. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing a light now. There's like a white light on the front.

Agent: Good, good. That's the power indicator. That should be normal. Now we're going to give it about two to three minutes to boot back up completely. During that time, you should see some other lights come on. Can you describe what you're seeing?

Customer: Um, yeah, so there's the white one, and now there's... I think a blue light? And it's blinking.

Agent: Perfect. The blue blinking light is the internet connection indicator. That means it's trying to sync with our network. Let's give it just a little bit more time here. (pause) How are we looking now?

Customer: Still blinking. It's been like thirty seconds I think.

Agent: That's normal. Sometimes it takes a minute or two for everything to sync up properly. (pause) While we're waiting, let me pull up your account information more thoroughly. I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, which is good news. 

Customer: Okay... (pause) Oh wait, now there's like a red light too. Is that bad?

Agent: A red light? That's... let me check on that. Can you tell me where exactly that red light is positioned on the modem?

Customer: It's on the bottom left. Is that the internet light?

Agent: Not typically. There shouldn't be a red light under normal operating conditions. When did that appear?

Customer: Just a few seconds ago. Right after the blue one started blinking.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Do you have a gateway unit, or is this just a modem? Sometimes the terminology varies.

Customer: I'm not... I don't know? It's a Frontier router. It's white and kind of rectangular.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, that helps. We might be looking at a hardware issue here. Let me have you try something else. Can you check if the cable coming into the back of the unit—the coaxial cable, it's the thicker cable—is firmly connected?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it. It looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Okay, try unscrewing it just slightly and then screwing it back in firmly. Sometimes these can get a little loose.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, I'm doing that now. (pause) Alright, I tightened it up.

Agent: Great. Now let's power cycle the unit one more time. Can you unplug it again?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Go ahead and wait about thirty seconds this time.

Customer: (pause) ...okay.

Agent: And plug it back in.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in, pause) Okay, plugged back in.

Agent: Alright. We should see that boot sequence again. What are you seeing now?

Customer: The white light is back. And the blue light is... it's not blinking anymore. It's steady now. That's good, right?

Agent: That's actually great, David. A steady blue light means you have a connection. Let me have you walk over to a computer or a device and see if you can connect to the Wi-Fi. Do you see the network name appearing?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see "Frontier" in my available networks. Let me try to connect. (pause, typing sounds) It's asking for the password. (pause) Okay, I'm typing it in. (pause) It says... it says "wrong password."

Agent: Hmm, okay. Do you happen to know what your Wi-Fi password is? It might be written on a card that came with your equipment, or it could be on a sticker on the back of the router.

Customer: Let me check. (pause, sounds of searching) I see a sticker here. It says... F-R-2-8-4-K-P-Q. Is that it?

Agent: Let's try that. Go ahead and enter that.

Customer: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm entering it now. (pause) Still says wrong password.

Agent: That's odd. Are you capitalized letters or lowercase?

Customer: Um, I think lowercase? Let me try it in all caps. (pause) Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, let me take a different approach here. Let's see if we can reset the Wi-Fi password on the gateway itself. There should be a reset button on the back of the unit. It's usually small and recessed.

Customer: (pause) I see a button. It says "Reset" on it.

Agent: That might be a factory reset button though. I actually don't want you to press that, as that will erase all your settings. Let me think about this for a second. (pause) 

Actually, David, I'm going to be honest with you. Given the red light that appeared earlier and the Wi-Fi connectivity issues we're experiencing even with a stable internet connection light, I think we might be dealing with a hardware malfunction on the gateway unit itself.

Customer: What do you mean? Is it broken?

Agent: It appears that way, yes. I'm pulling up your account details and I can see that you're out of warranty on the original equipment. However, what I can do is schedule a technician to come out and either replace or repair the unit. Would that work for you?

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet for work.

Agent: I understand. Let me check availability. (typing sounds) The earliest I'm showing is tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 6 PM. Is that something that could work?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... (pause) ...I guess it has to be. I don't have much choice here.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. I know this is frustrating. I'm going to get that appointment scheduled for you, and I'll also make a note on your account about what we tried today so the technician knows exactly what's going on.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything I can do in the meantime?

Agent: Unfortunately, with the equipment malfunction we're seeing, there's not much we can do from a software standpoint. You could try the factory reset if you wanted to, but I have to be honest—I don't think it's going to resolve this particular issue.

Customer: Yeah, I don't think I want to do that. I'll just wait for the technician.

Agent: That's probably your best bet. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly with all the appointment details. Is the email on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, that appointment is tomorrow between 2 and 6 PM. If you need to reschedule for any reason, you can call back or modify it online through your account portal.

Customer: Alright. Thank you, I guess. Even though we couldn't fix it.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't resolve it over the phone, David. But our technician will take good care of you tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
