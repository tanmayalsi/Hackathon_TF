Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I've already restarted the router like three times. Nothing's working.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got you here. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Whitmore.

Agent: Great, James. Thanks for that. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning and you've already restarted the router. Let me ask you a few questions real quick. Are you seeing any lights on the modem right now?

Customer: Um, yeah. There's like... the power light is on, but I don't see the internet light. Is that bad?

Agent: Okay, so the power light is on but no internet light. That's definitely something we can work with. Let me have you check a few things. Can you see if there's a cable box or anything near your modem?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, there's a white box... looks like maybe a gateway thing? It's connected to my wall.

Agent: Perfect. That's what we call the ONT, the optical network terminal. So that's where the fiber signal comes in. I need you to look at the lights on that box. What colors are you seeing?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. The power light is green, but... uh... the internet light or whatever you call it is... it's red. Is that the problem?

Agent: Yeah, that red light tells us there's an issue with the signal coming from the ONT. That's actually really helpful information. Alright, here's what we're gonna try. I'm gonna have you unplug that ONT box for about thirty seconds, okay? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now.

Agent: (pause) Great. Now, while we wait, can you tell me... have you experienced any issues with weather lately? Any storms in your area?

Customer: Actually, yeah. We had some pretty heavy rain and wind last night. Does that matter?

Agent: It can, actually. Weather can sometimes affect the fiber line. Okay, go ahead and plug that back in now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugged back in. (pause) Hmm, the lights are... still red. Same thing.

Agent: Still red on the internet light?

Customer: Yeah. Still red.

Agent: Okay. Let me try something else. Can you check if there are any loose cables? Specifically, look at where the cable is coming into the ONT and just make sure it's firmly connected.

Customer: (pause) Um, I'm checking... no, it looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Alright. And do you see any damage to the cables at all? Like, any cuts or anything?

Customer: No, I don't think so. They look fine.

Agent: Okay. (typing sounds) Let me... let me check something on my end here. (pause) I'm going to put you on a very quick hold while I check your line. This should only take a moment.

Customer: Sure, go ahead.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Alright, I'm back. James, I've got some good news and some not-so-good news. The good news is I'm not seeing any outages in your area currently. But I am seeing that we're detecting an issue with the signal strength coming to your location. It's reading very low, which would explain why that internet light is red.

Customer: Okay, so what does that mean? Is that something you can fix?

Agent: Well, that could be a few things. It could be an issue with the line itself, or there could be a problem with the ONT at your location. Since you mentioned the weather last night, it's possible something got damaged. What I'd like to do is... (pause) have you try one more thing, and then if that doesn't work, we'll need to get a technician out to you.

Customer: Alright, what do I try?

Agent: I want you to take a look at the back of the ONT. There should be a small reset button. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Let me... yeah, I see a little button here. It says reset on it.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, go ahead and hold that down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... (pause) Alright, ten seconds is up.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about thirty seconds for it to reboot and see if those lights change.

Customer: (pause) Okay... still waiting... the power light's green but... no, still red on the internet. This isn't working.

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately it looks like that didn't resolve it. (pause) I'm sorry, James. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to take a look. This could be anything from a damaged line to an issue with the ONT hardware itself, and they'll need to inspect it in person.

Customer: How long before someone can come out? I really need my internet back. I work from home.

Agent: I understand completely. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) What does your schedule look like? We have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have a window Thursday afternoon from 1 to 5 PM.

Customer: Um, tomorrow morning would be better. Let me do that.

Agent: Excellent. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got a technician scheduled for tomorrow, March 15th, between 8 AM and noon. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. The tech will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Okay, that works. Will I have to pay anything for this?

Agent: Since we're not able to troubleshoot this remotely and we suspect it may be a hardware or line issue on our end, there shouldn't be a service call charge. Our technician will assess the situation once they're there.

Customer: Alright, well, I guess that's something. This has been really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Especially since you work from home. The technician should be able to get you sorted out pretty quickly tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully tomorrow fixes it.

Agent: I'm sure it will. Thank you for your patience, James. We appreciate your business with Frontier. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
