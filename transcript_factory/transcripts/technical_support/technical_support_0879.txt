# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went out like twenty minutes ago and I have no idea what's going on. I need to get this fixed pretty quickly if possible.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I start by getting your account information? What's the phone number or account number associated with your Frontier account?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0147. That should be it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I see your account here. So you mentioned your internet went out about twenty minutes ago. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. Everything was working fine and then just... nothing. All my lights went out on the modem.

Agent: Okay, so the modem is completely unresponsive. Got it. Let me walk you through a few things here. First, can you tell me what color lights you're seeing on the modem right now? Or you said all the lights are out?

Customer: Yeah, all of them are off. The whole thing's dark.

Agent: Alright, that sounds like it might be a power issue then. Can you check the power cable for me? Make sure it's firmly connected to the back of the modem?

Customer: (pause) Okay, hold on. Let me... (sound of movement) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. The cable looks pretty secure to me, but let me just... (clicking sounds) ...tighten it up a bit.

Agent: Great, thank you.

Customer: Okay, done. But nothing's happening. Still no lights.

Agent: Right, no worries. Let's try unplugging it from the wall outlet completely. Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...done.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about thirty seconds for the modem to completely power down.

Customer: (pause) ...Alright.

Agent: While we're waiting, let me ask—did anything happen before the internet went out? Like, was there a storm in your area, a power outage, anything like that?

Customer: No, actually it was totally fine. Beautiful day out here. I don't know what happened. I was just working from home and then it just died.

Agent: Okay, that helps. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug that power cable back in now.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Um... I'm waiting... nothing yet. Just... nothing.

Agent: It can take about a minute to fully boot up. Just keep an eye on it. You should start seeing some lights come on.

Customer: (longer pause) ...No, still nothing. It's still completely dark. This is weird.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, David, let me ask you this—is the outlet itself working? Like, do you have anything else plugged into that same outlet that you could test?

Customer: Oh, good question. Um... (sound of movement) ...I have a lamp here. Let me plug it in... (pause) ...yeah, the lamp works. The outlet's fine.

Agent: Okay, so the outlet has power but the modem isn't responding. (typing sounds) This might indicate a hardware issue with the modem itself. Before we go down that road, let me check something on my end. Sometimes there can be service interruptions in your area. Let me look at that real quick.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any service alerts for your area at the moment. And I'm not showing any service interruptions on your account either. The last activity shows everything was running smoothly until... (pause) ...well, until right around the time you're telling me it went out.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it the modem?

Agent: It's looking that way. The modem appears to have either lost power or experienced a hardware failure. One more thing I want to try, though. Do you see a small reset button on your modem? It's usually recessed into the device.

Customer: (sound of searching) A reset button? Um... let me look... I see there's like a little hole here. Is that it?

Agent: That's it! Exactly. What you'll need is a paperclip or a pin—something small and thin. Hold the button down for about fifteen seconds. It's going to restart the modem.

Customer: Okay, finding a paperclip... (pause) ...I got one. (pause) Pushing in... how long did you say?

Agent: Fifteen seconds. Just hold it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, counting... this is... (pause) ...alright, I think that's about fifteen.

Agent: Alright, release it.

Customer: (pause) ...Nothing. Still nothing, Marcus. Still dark.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Yeah, I'm going to be honest with you, David. At this point, I'm fairly confident we're looking at a hardware failure. The modem isn't responding to any of the standard troubleshooting steps.

Customer: So you're saying it's dead? It's just... broken?

Agent: It appears so. The good news is that we can definitely get you a replacement unit. The bad news is, it'll take a few days for a new modem to arrive.

Customer: A few days? How many days are we talking about?

Agent: (typing sounds) Depending on your location, typically three to five business days. Let me see what I can do for expedited shipping here. (pause) Unfortunately, it looks like standard shipping is what we have available right now. But I can get a replacement modem ordered for you today, and we can waive the replacement fee given that this appears to be a device failure on our end.

Customer: Yeah, okay, I guess that's... I mean, that's better than nothing. But I really need internet before then. Is there any way to get it sooner?

Agent: (pause) I wish I could help you there. We don't have any faster options available currently. But let me make sure we get this order in right now so you're not waiting any longer than necessary.

Customer: (sighs) Alright. Yeah, okay. Go ahead and order it.

Agent: Great. I'm going to get that placed for you. You should expect the modem to arrive by... (typing sounds) ...Friday of next week at the latest. We'll send you a tracking number via email and text. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I mean... no, I guess not. This is just really frustrating, you know? I work from home and I need this.

Agent: I completely understand, David, and I'm sorry we're not able to get this resolved right away. I do have one suggestion—if you need internet access over the next few days, a lot of coffee shops and libraries have free WiFi if that's an option for you.

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I could do that, but it's not ideal. But I appreciate the suggestion.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, David. We really do appreciate your business with Frontier, and again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Your replacement modem is on its way, and you should receive that email confirmation within the next few minutes. You have a great day.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. You too.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
