Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And can I also get the last four digits of the Social Security number on the account, just to verify?

Customer: Sure, it's 4329.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. So you're experiencing a complete outage right now?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. No internet at all. The router's on, I can see the lights, but there's just... nothing's working.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Well, let's walk through a few things here. First, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on the router right now? Like, which ones are lit up?

Customer: Um, let's see... there's a green light on the left, and then there's an orange one blinking kind of in the middle somewhere.

Agent: Alright, so the orange blinking light—that usually indicates the router is trying to connect but hasn't established a connection yet. Have you tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in?

Customer: No, I haven't. Let me try that right now.

(pause)

Agent: Sure, go ahead.

Customer: (background noise of movement) Okay, unplugging it... (pause) And I'm waiting a minute like you... like, that's the typical thing to do, right?

Agent: Exactly, just give it about a minute to fully power down. That clears the memory and helps reset the connection.

(pause)

Customer: Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, the lights are coming back on. Green light on the left again... and now the orange light is blinking again.

Agent: Hmm, still blinking. So it's not establishing a full connection. Let me check our system here to see if there are any service issues in your area. (typing sounds) What's your address, please?

Customer: It's 4521 Maple Drive, Apartment 12B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 4521 Maple Drive, 12B. Let me just... (pause) Looking at that now. Okay, so I'm not seeing any major service outages reported in your area at this time, which is good news. Let me ask you a couple other questions. Do you have a modem as well, or is it all built into the router?

Customer: No, I have a separate modem. It's like... it's the white box thing?

Agent: Yes, that's it. And what lights are you seeing on the modem right now?

Customer: Uh... (pause) there's a red light on it. Just red.

Agent: Okay, so the red light on the modem indicates it's not connected or there's an issue. Let's try the same thing with the modem. Can you unplug that one and wait about a minute?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, waiting. This is taking forever, man.

Agent: I know, I appreciate your patience. It should just take about a minute and we'll see if that helps.

(pause)

Customer: Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Lights are coming on... and... nope. Still red.

Agent: Still red, okay. When was the last time you had your internet working normally?

Customer: This morning, like around seven or so. I got up and it was just... gone. No warning or anything.

Agent: Alright. And you haven't had any recent storms or power outages, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The power's been fine all morning.

Agent: Okay. Let me have you try one more thing. On the back of your modem, there should be a small reset button. It might be recessed. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, I think so. It's like... really small, right? Like I'd need something to push it?

Agent: Exactly. You can use a paperclip or a pen. Just hold it down for about ten to fifteen seconds while the modem is still plugged in.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause) I'm grabbing a paperclip. (pause) Got it. (pause) Pressing it in... and holding... (pause) ten seconds... fifteen seconds... and... (pause) okay, let go. Now what?

Agent: Give it another minute to boot back up and reestablish the connection. Let me know what color the light is.

(pause)

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's booting up. Lights are flashing... and uh... (pause) it's back to red again.

Agent: Still red. Alright, that's... that's not what we want to see. (pause) Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account and I can see that your service should be active. But it sounds like there might be a connectivity issue between our line and your modem. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it the modem that's broken?

Agent: It could be, but it could also be an issue with the line coming into your apartment. Have you noticed any loose cables at all where the line comes into your unit?

Customer: (pause) Let me check. (background noise) I'm looking behind the TV here where the cable comes in... I don't see anything obviously loose, but I'm not really... I mean, I don't really know what I'm looking at.

Agent: That's fair. Can you follow the cable from the wall where it enters and just make sure it's connected securely to the back of the modem?

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) Looking at it now. (pause) It seems pretty snug to me.

Agent: Alright. Unfortunately, we've gone through the basic troubleshooting steps and the modem isn't responding the way it should. At this point, I think we're looking at either a faulty modem or a line issue that I'm not able to diagnose remotely.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: I can schedule a technician to come out and take a look. They'll be able to check the line, inspect the connection, and if needed, replace the modem. How soon would you need someone to come out?

Customer: As soon as possible. Today if you can.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. (pause) We have a technician that could come out this afternoon between 1 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that works. That's fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to go ahead and schedule that for you. Your appointment is confirmed for today, between 1 and 4 PM. A technician will come out and get this resolved. Is there anything else I can help you with while I have you on the line?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I really need this working soon. I've got work stuff I need to do online.

Agent: I completely understand. The technician will get you back up and running today. Is the phone number on your account still the best way to reach you if there are any changes?

Customer: Yes, that's fine.

Agent: Great. So to confirm, we have your appointment for today between 1 and 4 PM at 4521 Maple Drive, Apartment 12B. You should receive a confirmation text or email shortly. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, and sorry again for the inconvenience. We'll have you back online today. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
