# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been trying to figure it out for like an hour now. It's completely down.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got that pulled up here. Account for... Robert Martinez, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage this morning. When did you first notice it wasn't working?

Customer: Um, around 7 AM, I guess? I tried to check my email before work and nothing was loading. I restarted the router like three times already, so I don't think that's gonna help.

Agent: Alright, well let's walk through a few things just to be thorough. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the router powered on?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. The lights are... (pause) okay, so the power light is on and it's white, but the internet light—the blue one—it's not on at all. That's not normal, right?

Agent: Right, no, that's definitely not normal. That blue light indicates an active internet connection, so the fact that it's off tells us the modem isn't connecting to our network. Let's try a few things. First, can you locate the power cable on your modem?

Customer: The modem? Uh, yeah, it's... it's right next to the router. There's a lot of cables back here.

Agent: Okay, so what I'd like you to do is unplug the power cable from the modem—just the modem, not the router—and wait about 30 seconds. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Sure, one sec. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. While we're waiting, I'm just gonna take a look at your account here to see if there's anything on our end that might be causing this. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any service alerts or outages in your area, so it does seem like it's isolated to your equipment.

Customer: (pause) Alright, 30 seconds is up. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay... the power light came back on, and now... (pause) I'm still not seeing the blue light.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let's give it a moment. Sometimes it takes 30 to 45 seconds for the modem to fully boot up and recognize the connection.

Customer: Yeah, okay. (long pause) Still nothing. The blue light's still off.

Agent: Alright, I'm not seeing that light come on. Um, let me ask you a few more questions. Do you see the coaxial cable? That's the thick cable with the connector on the end that plugs into the modem.

Customer: Uh, yeah, I see it. It's connected.

Agent: Can you verify that it's hand-tight? Sometimes they can work loose, especially if there's been any activity back there.

Customer: (sound of movement) I'm checking now... it seems pretty tight to me. Wait, actually, let me... (sound of unscrewing) Okay, I'm turning it and... oh, it was a little loose. Let me tighten it up. (sound of screwing, pause) Okay, it's tighter now.

Agent: Great. Hopefully that was the issue. Let's see if the blue light comes back on now.

Customer: (pause) Nope. Still nothing. This is... this is really not good. I've got a work call in like 20 minutes.

Agent: I understand, and we're gonna get this resolved. Let me try a couple more things. Is there an ethernet cable connected from the modem to your router?

Customer: Yeah, there's a yellow cable going from the back of the modem to the router.

Agent: Perfect. Can you unplug that ethernet cable on both ends and then plug it back in?

Customer: (sound of unplugging, pause) Okay, it's unplugged. Now I'm plugging it back in... in the modem... and now in the router. Done.

Agent: (pause) Still no blue light?

Customer: Nope. Nothing.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Let me check something here on my end. (typing sounds, longer pause) One moment, let me check the connection to your address specifically. (more typing) Actually, it looks like... hmm, the line shows as active on our end, but we're not getting a connection handshake from your modem.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: That means our system can see that you have service provisioned to your address, but your modem isn't communicating back to us. That could indicate a problem with the modem itself, or potentially an issue with the line coming into your house.

Customer: So what do I do? Do I need a new modem or something?

Agent: Well, let's try one more thing before we go down that road. I'm going to have you do what's called a factory reset on the modem. Now, this will erase all the settings, but it should restore the modem to its original state, and hopefully it'll reconnect to our network. There's usually a small reset button on the back.

Customer: A reset button? (sound of movement) Yeah, I see it. It's tiny. How do I...?

Agent: You'll need to hold it down with a paperclip or something thin for about 10 to 15 seconds. Do you have something like that?

Customer: Hold on. (pause) Okay, I found a paperclip. (pause) I'm holding it down... (long pause) Okay, now the modem's lights are doing weird stuff. They're all blinking.

Agent: That's normal. That means it's resetting. Give it about two to three minutes to fully reboot and reconfigure.

Customer: (pause) Two or three minutes? Uh... okay. (long pause) [inaudible] ...sorry, what?

Agent: Just let it sit there for a moment. (pause)

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, so the power light is back to being solid white, but... the blue light is still not on.

Agent: (sigh) Okay. Um, I'm gonna be honest with you here, Robert. I think at this point we might be looking at a hardware issue with the modem itself, or possibly a line problem on our end that's going to need a technician to come out and check.

Customer: Are you serious? So we've done all this and it's still not working?

Agent: I know, I'm frustrated too. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I can definitely schedule a technician to come out to your home. We have availability... let me see... tomorrow afternoon between 1 and 5 PM, or we have Thursday morning between 8 AM and 12 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow? I need internet today. This is... I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize. Unfortunately, we don't have same-day availability in your area right now. But if you need internet urgently, I can expedite this for you, and we might be able to get someone out this evening. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check with dispatch.

Customer: Okay, fine. Please do that.

Agent: Thank you. One moment.

(hold music plays for approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. Unfortunately, our dispatch team says they're fully booked for today, but I was able to add you to our priority list for tomorrow morning at 9 AM. The technician will be able to diagnose whether it's a modem issue or a line issue.

Customer: So there's nothing I can do right now?

Agent: Well, we can try a couple more things if you'd like—like checking if your outlets are working properly, or we could try rebooting everything one more time—but honestly, given that we've already done the basic troubleshooting, I think a technician visit is probably your best bet at this point.

Customer: (pause) Yeah... I guess you're right. Okay, so tomorrow at 9 AM?

Agent: That's correct. And I'm going to put a note on your account that this is urgent, so the technician will know to prioritize your visit. You should also receive a courtesy call about an hour before they arrive.

Customer: Alright. Thank you, I guess.

Agent: I apologize again that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Okay. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow morning. Have a good day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
