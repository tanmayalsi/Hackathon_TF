Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I work from home and I'm already behind on some stuff.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... and I'm seeing an account for... is this Marcus Thompson?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Marcus. So your internet service is down as of this morning, you said? Do you remember what time it went out?

Customer: Uh, around 8:30 or so. I was just sitting down to start my day and nothing. The WiFi symbol on my laptop just... disappeared.

Agent: Okay. And just to confirm, you're not seeing any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: (pause) Well, I have... I have this box, the modem thing I guess, and it's got lights but they're not... the internet light isn't on. It's just like, red or off or something.

Agent: Alright, that's actually helpful information. So we're definitely dealing with a connection issue. Let me walk you through a few troubleshooting steps, okay?

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent: First thing I want you to do is unplug the modem from the power. Just pull it out of the wall outlet.

Customer: (pause) Okay, done. How long do I leave it unplugged?

Agent: Give it about thirty seconds. While we're waiting, is there anything unusual you noticed before it went down? Any storms in your area last night, or did you notice anything different?

Customer: No, no storms or anything like that. It was just working fine yesterday and then this morning... nothing.

Agent: Okay, got it. (pause) Alright, thirty seconds should be up. Go ahead and plug that modem back in for me.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay, it's back in. What do I do now?

Agent: Now let's give it a minute or so to boot back up. While it's doing that, can you tell me — do you also have a separate router, or is everything in one unit?

Customer: Um, I think it's separate. There's the modem box and then there's like a white rectangle thing that's separate.

Agent: Perfect, that's your router. So we have both devices. Once that modem finishes booting up, we should see some lights come back on. Are you seeing anything yet?

Customer: (pause) The lights are coming back on, yeah. I see green and amber lights now.

Agent: Great! That's what we want to see. Now, the internet light specifically — is that lit up?

Customer: Uh... no, it's still not on. The internet light is still... I don't know, not lit.

Agent: Okay, so we're making some progress but not quite there yet. Let me try something. What I want you to do is also unplug the router — the white rectangle — and let it sit for thirty seconds as well.

Customer: Alright. (pause) Unplugged.

Agent: Good. While we wait, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Marcus, I'm looking at your account and I'm showing that your service is active and there shouldn't be any outages in your area, so that's good news.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: Let's plug that router back in now.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Done.

Agent: Alright, give that about a minute to fully boot. In the meantime, let me ask you this — when you look at the modem, are there any cables that seem loose or anything that looks out of place?

Customer: (pause) No, everything looks pretty tight to me. There's like, three cables going in, I think.

Agent: That's right — power, and then your internet connection comes in from outside. Okay, now is the internet light on the modem showing anything?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. It's still dark.

Agent: Hmm. Let me try a couple more things here. Can you actually try connecting to the WiFi from your laptop? Sometimes the lights don't immediately indicate...

Customer: Yeah, I can try. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at available networks and I don't see anything. Nothing's showing up.

Agent: Not even the Frontier WiFi network?

Customer: No. Nothing from Frontier or anything else. Should I be seeing something?

Agent: You should definitely be seeing the Frontier network. Okay, let me check something here. (pause) (typing sounds) Marcus, I'm not seeing any activity on the line either. The modem isn't registering a connection to our network at all.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it broken?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be a modem issue, but more likely at this point I'm thinking there might be something happening with the line coming into your home. Has anyone done any work outside recently? New construction, landscaping, anything like that?

Customer: Um... well, the cable company or somebody was out here like two days ago doing some work on the street. There were workers and a truck and stuff.

Agent: (pause) Ah, okay, that might be it. Sometimes during that kind of work, lines can get damaged or disconnected. Can you tell me what street you're on?

Customer: I'm on Maple Drive. Number 412.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. Okay, Marcus, I think what we're dealing with here is possibly a line issue from that external work. I've gone through our standard troubleshooting — rebooted both devices, confirmed your account is active and there are no service outages reported in your area — but I'm not seeing any connection coming through to your modem from our network.

Customer: So what do I do? Can someone come out and fix it?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I can schedule a technician to come out and check the line. Let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) Do you have availability tomorrow? We have a morning slot available between 8 AM and 12 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning? I mean... I really need this working today if possible. I have a lot of work piling up.

Agent: I completely understand. (pause) Let me check if we have any same-day appointments. (pause) Unfortunately, our technicians for today are fully booked. The earliest I can get someone out there is tomorrow morning in that 8 to 12 window.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, I guess that'll have to work. Can they definitely fix it?

Agent: The technician will be able to assess what happened with the line and repair it. Given that there was external work done in your area, they should be able to get to the bottom of it pretty quickly. I'm going to get that appointment scheduled for you.

Customer: Alright.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you set up for tomorrow, June 15th, between 8 AM and noon. The technician will call you 30 minutes before they arrive. Is this a good number to reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to email you a confirmation of that appointment as well. I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone, Marcus, but I'm confident our technician will be able to take care of this for you tomorrow.

Customer: Okay. I guess I'll just have to work around this tonight.

Agent: I know it's not ideal. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, Marcus. We appreciate your patience. You should see that technician tomorrow morning. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
