Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I've already tried unplugging the router and all that stuff. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. And when you say the internet's been down since this morning, did anything happen before it went out? Like a storm, power outage, anything like that?

Customer: No, no. It was fine when I went to bed last night. I woke up and just... nothing. My WiFi wasn't showing up at all.

Agent: Okay, so no WiFi signal at all. Did you check if the modem is powered on? Is it showing any lights?

Customer: Yeah, I looked at it. There's a light on—it's like, I don't know, red or orange maybe? And it's just sitting there blinking.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful. A red or orange light usually means there's no connection coming in from our network. But let's walk through a few things. Can you locate your modem for me?

Customer: (background noise of items moving) Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's by the TV.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, you tried unplugging it already?

Customer: Yeah, I did that like twenty minutes ago. Let it sit for a couple minutes and plugged it back in. Still the same thing.

Agent: Okay, that's good troubleshooting. Can you check the cables for me? Is there a cable going from the wall into the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... yeah, it's connected. Both the power and the, uh... the internet cable thing.

Agent: Perfect. And is the cable... does it look like it's pushed in all the way? Sometimes if there's a loose connection—

Customer: I'm looking at it now. It looks pretty secure to me.

Agent: Alright. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any signal coming into your address. That's interesting. When was the last time your internet was definitely working?

Customer: Last night around ten o'clock, I was watching something, and it was working fine.

Agent: Okay. And you haven't moved anything or... this is just the same setup?

Customer: No, nothing's moved. Look, I really need this working. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me try a couple more things. Can you unplug the modem one more time? Just the power cable.

Customer: (sound of movement) Yeah, okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: And leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds if you can.

Customer: (pause) Okay. (pause) ...thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (plugging sounds) It's plugged in. Okay, the light is still... still red.

Agent: Still red. Let's give it about a minute to fully boot up. Sometimes it takes a little bit.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it. Still the same. Red light. Nothing.

Agent: Alright. (pause) I'm looking at our network diagnostics here, and what I'm seeing is that we're not getting a signal from your node in the area. That's unusual. Let me check if there's any maintenance going on in your neighborhood.

Customer: Maintenance? Like, someone's working on it?

Agent: Possibly. Let me see here. (typing sounds) Hmm, no active maintenance notifications on the system. That's... actually, can I ask—do you have a battery backup unit on your modem? Sometimes if the power went out briefly, it might be...

Customer: A what? No, I don't think so. It's just the modem and the router.

Agent: Okay. And the router—do you have separate WiFi signal from the modem?

Customer: Yeah, they're separate. I've got like a separate Linksys router, and that's not showing any lights at all now that I think about it.

Agent: Right, so the router wouldn't have power because the modem's the one that failed. Let me... (pause) Can you try checking the coaxial cable one more time? The thick one coming from the wall?

Customer: (background noise) I'm unplugging it now. It looks fine, honestly. No visible damage or anything.

Agent: And when you unplug it, do you see any corrosion around the connection? Any discoloration?

Customer: (pause) No, it looks clean.

Agent: Okay, plug it back in for me. Make sure it's nice and tight.

Customer: (sound of cable connecting) There. It's in.

Agent: (pause) ...Still nothing?

Customer: Nope. Still red.

Agent: (sighs) Alright, let me check something else here. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a line test. This might take a moment.

Customer: How long is this going to take? I really—like I said, I need to get online.

Agent: I understand. This should just be a minute or so. (pause) ...Okay, so the line test is actually not completing. That tells me the signal isn't getting through from our end. There might be an issue with the outside line or the connection point.

Customer: So what does that mean? What do I do?

Agent: Well, unfortunately, it sounds like this might be something on our infrastructure side. I don't want to keep you going in circles with troubleshooting. I think we need to get a technician out to your place to check the exterior lines and the connection.

Customer: A technician? How long does that take?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) The earliest I'm showing available is... tomorrow afternoon, between 1 and 5 PM. I know that's not ideal.

Customer: Tomorrow? I need internet today.

Agent: I hear you. (pause) Unfortunately, that's all we have available right now. Let me just confirm—you're at 147 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay. I'm going to schedule a technician visit for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM. Our tech will check everything from the street to your modem. Is that address still the best number to reach you at?

Customer: Yeah. But I mean... is there nothing we can do today?

Agent: (pause) I wish there was. Without a signal coming in, it's not something we can troubleshoot remotely. I'm really sorry. At least once the technician confirms the issue tomorrow, we can get it resolved right away.

Customer: This is ridiculous. I'm paying for this service and it's not working.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize. This shouldn't be happening. The tech will definitely get you sorted out tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with right now?

Customer: No. I guess I'll just... I'll see you tomorrow then.

Agent: Alright, we appreciate your patience. You should get a confirmation email with your service window. Thank you for calling Frontier, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today.

Customer: Yeah. Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Take care. Goodbye.
