# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just... it's not working. It went out about an hour ago and I've tried unplugging everything and plugging it back in, but nothing's happening.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm pulling that up now. And just to confirm, I have the account under the name Robert Chen at 412 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned the internet went out about an hour ago. Was there anything happening before it went down? Like a storm, or did you notice any changes?

Customer: Um, no storm or anything. It was just working fine this morning and then around noon it just... stopped. The modem's got lights on it, but nothing's loading on my computer.

Agent: Okay, so the modem is powered on. That's good. Let me ask you this—what color is the light on the front of your modem? The main one?

Customer: (pause) There's like a blue one that's solid, and then there's a red one that's blinking.

Agent: Okay, so you've got a red blinking light. That typically indicates a connection issue. Let me walk you through a few things we can try. First, can you locate the power cable on the back of your modem?

Customer: Yeah, I see it.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to have you unplug that, but before you do, can you also see the reset button? It should be a small recessed button on the back.

Customer: Hold on... (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's like a little hole, right?

Agent: Exactly. So here's what we're gonna do. I want you to unplug the power cable, wait about thirty seconds, then plug it back in. Don't press the reset button yet—let's try this first and see if that clears it up.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) ...okay, waiting. (longer pause) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great. Now let's give it about a minute to boot back up. While we're waiting, let me just check on your account here. Are you seeing any service alerts or outages in your area? (brief pause) Okay, I'm not showing any widespread outages in your neighborhood, so that's a good sign. How are those lights looking now?

Customer: Um... still the same. Blue solid, red blinking.

Agent: Still red blinking. Okay, that's alright. Let's try the next step. I'm going to have you do a factory reset on the modem. Now, this will clear everything, but it shouldn't take too long to reconnect. You ready?

Customer: Yeah, go ahead.

Agent: Okay, so take that reset button and hold it down for about ten seconds. You'll need something thin like a paperclip or a pen to press it because it's recessed.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I've got a pen... pressing it now... (another pause) How long should this take?

Agent: It should restart automatically. Give it about two to three minutes and those lights should change. The system will need to reboot and reconnect to our network.

Customer: Okay, so I'm just... waiting?

Agent: Exactly. Just give it a couple minutes. (pause) While that's happening, let me pull up your service details here. I'm seeing that your modem is... looks like it's about four years old. Is that the equipment we originally installed?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. It's been working fine until today.

Agent: Understood. Alright, so let's see what's happening now. Are you noticing any changes with those lights?

Customer: (pause) No, still the same. Red blinking, blue solid. This is... I really need this working. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I understand completely. Let me try something else here. Are you able to access the modem's interface? Do you have a computer or phone you can use?

Customer: What do you mean, access it?

Agent: You can usually go to your browser and type in 192.168.0.1 or sometimes 192.168.100.1. It'll pull up the modem's settings page. Do you want to try that?

Customer: Um, I don't have another device right now. My computer's the main thing I use and obviously that's not connecting.

Agent: Right, yeah, that makes sense. Let me think about what else we can try. (pause) Can you tell me—when you say nothing's loading, do you mean you can't see any WiFi networks available?

Customer: I mean, I can see the network name, but when I try to connect it just... it won't load anything. Like I get the little spinning wheel and then it times out.

Agent: Okay, so you can see the WiFi network and you're connecting to it, but you're not getting internet access. That's helpful information. Let me ask you this—do you have any other devices in the house? Even a phone?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my phone.

Agent: Perfect. Can you try connecting your phone to the WiFi and see if you get any internet on that?

Customer: (pause, background noise of phone unlocking) Yeah, let me try... (longer pause) No, same thing. It connects but nothing loads.

Agent: Alright, so it's affecting all devices. That tells me it's likely a modem or connection issue on our end. Let me check a couple things in the system here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your line right now... Hmm.

Customer: What? What are you seeing?

Agent: Well, I'm not seeing any obvious issues on the line, but I'm also not seeing an active connection from your modem to our network right now. That red blinking light is the signal. It means the modem can't establish a connection to our equipment.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it my modem?

Agent: It could be the modem, or there could be an issue with the line coming into your house. Sometimes we get line degradation or noise that prevents the handshake. Let me try power-cycling your modem one more time from this end. Give me just a second. (typing sounds) Okay, I've initiated a reset on the account side. Give it about thirty seconds and see if anything changes.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) Nothing yet.

Agent: Still nothing? (pause) Alright, I'm going to be honest with you, Robert. At this point, I think we might be looking at either a hardware issue with the modem or a physical line problem. Since we're not getting a connection established, I think we need to get a technician out there to take a look.

Customer: Really? How long does that take? I need this working.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check what appointments we have available. (typing sounds) I can get someone out there as early as... it looks like we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or the day after between 1 and 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning, I guess. Can you make sure they bring a new modem or whatever?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to make a note here that we've already tried multiple troubleshooting steps and we suspect a hardware or line issue, so they'll definitely be prepared. They may bring equipment with them. Let me get you scheduled. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you down for tomorrow, 8 to noon. A technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive. Does that phone number ending in 4147 still work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you have it, your ticket number for this is 847953. Do you want me to email that to you as well?

Customer: Sure, yeah.

Agent: Great. I've got your email in the system and I'm sending that over now. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... hopefully it gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I really hope so too. I know this is frustrating, and I appreciate your patience while we worked through the troubleshooting. The technician will take good care of you tomorrow morning. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, Robert.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
