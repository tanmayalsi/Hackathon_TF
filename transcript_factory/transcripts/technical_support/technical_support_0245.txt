Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing your account here. So your internet service went down this morning, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 AM. I was working from home and just... it just stopped. One minute everything's fine, next minute nothing.

Agent: Got it. And you haven't had any service since then?

Customer: No, nothing. I've rebooted the router like three times already, unplugged it, waited, plugged it back in. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting on your part. Let me just ask you a few quick questions. Are you seeing any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) Yeah, there's... there's a red light on the modem. It's solid red.

Agent: Okay, so you're getting a solid red light. That typically indicates a connection issue between the modem and our network. Is the power light green, or is everything red?

Customer: No, the power light is green. It's just the internet light that's red.

Agent: Perfect, that's helpful information. And this is the equipment we provided, correct? Not a third-party modem?

Customer: Yeah, it's your equipment. Came with the installation.

Agent: Alright, I'm going to have you try something for me. I want you to unplug the power cable from the modem for about 30 seconds. Just pull it out completely.

Customer: Okay... (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about 30 seconds while that happens... (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugged back in... (pause) Okay, lights are coming back on... (pause) Still red. Still just red on the internet connection.

Agent: Still red, huh? (pause) Okay, let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your line status... Hmm, that's interesting. It's showing as provisioned correctly on our end. Let me just... (pause) Can you tell me, do you have any other devices connected to the network? Phone, Smart TV, anything like that?

Customer: Um, yeah, I have my phone connected usually, but I turned WiFi off on it. I've got a smart TV but that's unplugged right now. Honestly, I was trying to isolate the problem.

Agent: That's actually really smart. I appreciate that. Okay, so this is interesting because from our side, everything looks like it should be working. The modem should be provisioned and active. Let me try a few more things. Can you check the back of the modem for me? I want to make sure your ethernet cable is firmly connected.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's plugged in. It looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Okay, try unplugging it from the modem side and plugging it back in. Just to make sure we get a good connection.

Customer: (pause) Doing it now... (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Any change in the lights?

Customer: (pause) No, still the same. Still red.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Um, let me check our system again. (typing sounds) I'm going to look at our network in your area... (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any outages reported in your neighborhood. But that doesn't necessarily mean anything's wrong on our end. Let me try a factory reset on the modem. This will clear all the settings, but it should reprogram everything automatically.

Customer: Okay... how do I do that?

Agent: There should be a small button on the back of the modem. It might be recessed. Do you see it?

Customer: (pause) I think I see it. It's really small, right?

Agent: Yeah, exactly. It might say "reset" next to it, or it might just be unlabeled.

Customer: Okay, I see it. What do I do?

Agent: You'll need to hold it down for about 10 seconds. You might need a paperclip or something thin. The modem will restart, and it'll take a few minutes to boot back up completely.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm holding it... (pause) It's restarting now. The lights went off. (pause) Okay, they're coming back on... (pause) It's been a minute... (pause) Okay, now everything's booting up. Should I wait for it to fully start?

Agent: Yeah, let's give it another minute or so. Just let it fully boot up.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) I'm looking at it now. (pause) Derek, it's still red. The internet light is still red.

Agent: (pause) It's still red after the factory reset?

Customer: Yeah, still red.

Agent: Okay, um... (pause) That's unusual. Typically we'd see that resolve with a reset. Let me put you on a brief hold while I escalate this to our technical team. It should just be a minute or two. Is that alright?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: (hold music plays for approximately 90 seconds)

Agent: Okay, I'm back with you. So I've talked to our technical team, and they're seeing the same thing on their end that I'm seeing. Your modem is connecting to our network, but it's not getting a downstream signal. That usually means one of two things. Either there's a signal issue on the line going to your house, or the modem itself might be failing.

Customer: So what do we do about that?

Agent: Well, we have a couple of options. I can dispatch a technician to your location to check the line and possibly replace the modem if needed. But the earliest we could get someone out there would be Thursday between 8 AM and noon.

Customer: Thursday? That's two days from now. I need internet before then.

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately, without a technician visit, there's not much more I can troubleshoot over the phone. If it's the line, they'll need to check the outside connections. And if it's the modem, we'd need to swap it out for you.

Customer: (pause) So there's no other way to fix this today?

Agent: Not from a troubleshooting perspective, unfortunately. I wish I had better news. We could try a few more things, but based on what I'm seeing and what the tech team sees, this is almost certainly hardware-related.

Customer: (sighs) Alright. I guess Thursday morning is better than nothing. Can you get someone out here?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get some information from you. Are you available Thursday morning between 8 AM and noon?

Customer: Yeah, I'll make myself available.

Agent: Great. And you're at 555-0147, correct?

Customer: That's right.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule a technician visit for you on Thursday between 8 and noon. They'll call you 30 minutes before they arrive to confirm. The work order number is 447829. Make sure you have that handy in case you need to reference it.

Customer: Okay, 447829. Got it.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I'm just... I'm frustrated about losing two days of work here, but I understand.

Agent: I really do apologize for the inconvenience. And I'll make sure to note on your account that this was urgent. If anything changes or if you want to reach out before Thursday, don't hesitate to call back.

Customer: Alright, thanks Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. We appreciate your business, and we'll get this taken care of for you on Thursday. Have a good day.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Goodbye.

Customer: Goodbye.
