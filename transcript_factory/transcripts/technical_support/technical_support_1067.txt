# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I work from home and I've already lost a couple hours of productivity.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: David Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got you here. So your internet service is currently down. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router? Are they powered on?

Customer: Uh, let me... yeah, I'm looking at it now. The modem has like... it's got a red light on it. That's not good, right?

Agent: Okay, a red light typically indicates there's a connection issue. That's actually a good sign because it means the modem is powered on. Let's try some basic troubleshooting. Can you tell me where your modem is located?

Customer: It's, um, in my office. It's on the shelf above my desk.

Agent: Great. What I'd like you to do is locate the power cable in the back and unplug it for me. We'll do a hard reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm unplugging it now. It's... it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now I'm going to need you to wait about thirty seconds while the system resets.

Customer: Alright, I'm just... waiting here.

Agent: (pause) Thanks for your patience. Okay, go ahead and plug that power cable back in for me.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's back in. Um, the light's still red though.

Agent: Alright, the modem needs a minute or two to fully boot back up. While we wait, let me ask you a couple questions. Have there been any recent storms in your area or any construction work?

Customer: No, no storms. Nothing like that. It just stopped working this morning when I went to use it. Everything was fine last night.

Agent: Okay, and have you made any changes to your equipment recently? New router, moved anything around?

Customer: No, nothing. Same setup I've had for... I don't know, eight months now?

Agent: Got it. Is your router a separate device from your modem, or do you have a combo unit?

Customer: It's... I think it's separate? I have two boxes.

Agent: Okay, perfect. Can you check on the router now? What color are the lights on that one?

Customer: (pause) Um, it's completely dark. There's no lights at all.

Agent: The router's not powered on then. Can you check if the power cable is plugged in?

Customer: Oh! Oh wait, I think I see the issue. The power strip it was plugged into is... it's turned off. Did I... did I accidentally kick that?

Agent: (chuckles) It happens more often than you'd think. Go ahead and turn that power strip back on for us.

Customer: (sound of switch clicking) Okay, it's on now. Lights are... they're starting to come on. I see some blue lights now. That's better, right?

Agent: Good news! Blue is what we're looking for. Now let's go back to that modem. What color is the light on there now?

Customer: (pause) It's still... it's still red. It's been a few minutes now. Shouldn't it be... I don't know, green or blue or something?

Agent: You would think so, yes. Let me check your account from my end to see if there's anything on the line. (typing sounds) Hmm, let me pull up your service history here. I'm seeing a connection status, but it's showing as inactive on our end. 

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It might be an issue with the connection coming into your home, or it could be something with the modem itself. Let me try one more thing. Can you check the cable that goes from the wall outlet into your modem? Make sure it's firmly connected?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it... it seems pretty tight. But let me... (sound of tugging) ...let me just push it in a little more to be sure.

Agent: Good thinking. Sometimes they work loose over time.

Customer: Okay, it's definitely in there now. But the light's still red.

Agent: Still red, okay. What about the back of the modem? Do you see any other lights back there?

Customer: (pause) There's like... a white light? And an orange light maybe? They're both on.

Agent: Okay, those shouldn't be concerning. It's really that red light that's the issue. Let me try a few things from this end. (typing sounds) I'm going to reset your connection on our network. This might take a moment.

Customer: Alright.

Agent: (pause) (more typing) Okay, I've sent the reset through. The modem might restart. You might see some flickering on the lights. Can you keep an eye on it?

Customer: (long pause) I... I see it flickering a little bit. But the red light is still there. It's been going back and forth between red and... nothing, and then red again.

Agent: Hmm. That's unusual. How long has it been doing that?

Customer: Just started when you... when you did whatever you did from your end.

Agent: Okay. David, I want to be honest with you. Usually when we see this pattern, it can indicate either a problem with the modem's connection to our network, or it could be an issue with the modem hardware itself. Let me check something in your account... (typing sounds) Have you experienced any outages or service issues in your area recently that you're aware of?

Customer: No, I haven't seen anything. And my neighbors' internet seems to be working fine as far as I know.

Agent: That's actually helpful information. Let me try one more diagnostic. I'm going to run a test on the line to see if I can detect a signal coming from your modem.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) (long pause) I'm not getting a strong signal back. That suggests the modem either isn't communicating properly or... or there might be a hardware failure. When was the last time you rebooted everything?

Customer: This morning. I mean, when it stopped working, I restarted everything. The modem, the router, my computer. Nothing helped.

Agent: Alright. I think at this point, we have a couple of options. We can schedule a technician visit to your home to check the modem and the line coming in, or we can try replacing the modem with a newer unit. How long have you had that modem?

Customer: Um, it came with the service, so about eight months like I said.

Agent: Okay, and you haven't had any issues with it until today?

Customer: No, it's been perfect until this morning.

Agent: I wish I had better news over the phone. Because the signal isn't reaching us properly, I can't fully diagnose this remotely. I'd recommend scheduling a technician visit. They can check the modem, check the line, and make sure everything is functioning properly. Would that work for you?

Customer: How long would that take? Like, when could someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) We have some openings this week. Would a technician visit between 8 AM and 12 PM work for you, or would you prefer an afternoon window?

Customer: Morning would be better. What day?

Agent: Let me see here... we have availability tomorrow morning, or Wednesday afternoon is also possible. Tomorrow would be faster, obviously.

Customer: Yeah, tomorrow morning would be great. What time should I expect them?

Agent: [inaudible] ...between 8 and 12. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. And David, I apologize that we couldn't resolve this over the phone. The technician will be equipped to handle this properly.

Customer: Okay. I appreciate the help at least. How much is this going to cost me?

Agent: Since this is within your service area and you haven't had any issues before, there shouldn't be a service call charge. We'll cover that. You'll just need to be home tomorrow morning.

Customer: Alright, that's good to know. Is there anything else I should try before they get here?

Agent: You can try the reboot one more time if you'd like, but honestly, I don't think it's going to resolve it. Just leave everything powered as is for now. Do you have a contact number for the technician to reach you if they need to?

Customer: Yeah, they can just use this number. 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. Let me confirm all of this for you. We have a technician scheduled for tomorrow morning, 8 AM to 12 PM window, at your address on file. They'll diagnose the modem and line issue. Is everything correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: Great. You'll receive a confirmation email within the hour with all the details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's it. Thanks for trying to fix it.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't resolve it remotely, David, but the technician will take great care of you. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
