Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without service for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now... and I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. So your internet completely stopped working this morning?

Customer: Yeah, completely. No lights on the modem, nothing. It was working fine last night and then this morning, nothing.

Agent: Alright, let's get this troubleshot. First thing—can you tell me what modem you're using? Is it the white Frontier router we provided?

Customer: Yeah, the white one. Should I try unplugging it?

Agent: Actually, let's do that. Go ahead and unplug the modem from the power source. While you're doing that, let's also unplug the router if you have a separate one.

Customer: (background noise of movement) Okay, unplugged the modem. And yeah, I've got a separate router too. (pause) Got that unplugged as well.

Agent: Perfect. Let those sit unplugged for about thirty seconds. That'll do a hard reset.

Customer: (pause) Alright, thirty seconds... okay, should be good now.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (background noise, pause) Okay, it's plugged in. And... hmm, I'm not seeing any lights yet.

Agent: Give it a moment to boot up. That can take about two minutes sometimes. While we wait, let me check if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) What's your address?

Customer: It's 447 Maple Street, Unit 3B, in Springfield.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm checking the outage map here... and I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area right now. So that's good news. Okay, are you seeing any lights on the modem yet?

Customer: Um... no, still nothing. This is weird. The power cable looks fine though.

Agent: Okay, let's try a different approach. Is the power outlet working? Can you maybe plug something else into that outlet? Like a lamp or your phone charger?

Customer: (pause) Let me try... yeah, I've got a lamp here. (pause) Okay, I plugged in the lamp and... the lamp is on. So the outlet's fine.

Agent: Good, that rules that out. The modem might have an issue then. Let me ask you—do you see any kind of reset button on the modem? It's usually a small red button on the back.

Customer: (sounds of moving around) Yeah, I see it. I see the reset button.

Agent: Don't press that yet. Let me try something else first. Can you unplug it again and wait about sixty seconds this time? Sometimes it just needs a longer reset.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, sure. Unplugging it now. (pause) Yeah, I'll wait.

Agent: (typing sounds) While we wait, are you getting any error messages on any of your devices? Like on your computer or phone?

Customer: No, nothing. It's just... no internet. I tried connecting to the WiFi and it's not even showing up.

Agent: Right, okay. So the router won't have anything to broadcast if the modem isn't working. That makes sense. Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (background noise) Plugging it in. (pause) ...Still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay, and you're looking at the front of the modem, right? There should be several indicator lights.

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking right at it. The whole thing is just dark. Completely dark.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me check something here. I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I contact our technical team to see if there's something on our end with your line. Just hold tight for one moment.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (hold music, pause) Thank you for holding. I'm back. So I've checked with our backend systems and your line appears to be active and online on our end. That's actually indicating that the issue is likely with the modem itself—it may have failed.

Customer: Oh no, really? So what does that mean?

Agent: So, the good news is we can ship you a replacement modem. The bad news is it'll take about three to five business days to arrive.

Customer: (frustrated) Three to five days? I need internet before then. I work from home.

Agent: I understand, and I'm sorry about that. Let me see what options we have. Can you get to one of our Frontier retail locations? We might have replacement modems available for immediate pickup.

Customer: (pause) Um, I... I don't think there's one near me. Let me look... no, the closest one is like thirty minutes away and they're closed right now. They close at six.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, well they open again tomorrow at nine AM if that's an option for you?

Customer: (sighs) I... I can't really get there tomorrow morning. I have back-to-back meetings. Isn't there anything else?

Agent: Let me see... (pause) One thing we could try—before we give up on this modem—is the factory reset. That sometimes brings a modem back to life if there's a software issue. Would you like to try that?

Customer: (hesitant) I mean... yeah, if you think it might work.

Agent: Okay, so go ahead and press that reset button on the back. You might need to hold it for about ten seconds. The modem may power cycle on its own.

Customer: (pause, background noise of button pressing) I'm pressing it... holding it... come on, come on... (pause) nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Okay, yeah... I think we're looking at a hardware failure here. Let me be honest with you—the modem is likely not recoverable.

Customer: So I'm just out of service until... when?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. But let me see what I can do. Let me check if we can expedite that shipment for you. (typing sounds, pause) I'm going to put a priority on that replacement order. That can get it to you in one to two business days instead of three to five. That's the best I can do on my end.

Customer: (frustrated) So at best, I don't have internet until tomorrow evening?

Agent: I'm really sorry about this. I know it's not ideal, especially when you work from home. That's the quickest we can get the modem to you. Or again, if you can make it to the retail location tomorrow morning before work, that would get you up and running immediately.

Customer: (long pause) I... I don't know. Let me think about it. Can you just go ahead and order the replacement to be shipped?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to place that priority order right now for you. You should receive it by end of business tomorrow. You'll get a tracking number via email as soon as it ships. Typically ships within the next few hours.

Customer: Okay. (pause) And this is just going to be the modem, right? There won't be any extra charge?

Agent: No extra charge. The modem replacement is covered under your service agreement.

Customer: Alright. Well, I guess that's something. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No. No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well I appreciate your patience, and again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. You should see that tracking email very soon. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
