Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got work I need to do, so I'm kind of in a bind here.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick so we can get this sorted out for you. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 428 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router right now? Are they on at all?

Customer: Um, yeah, the modem's got a light on it, but it's... it's red, I think? And the router doesn't have any lights at all.

Agent: Okay, so the modem has a red light. That typically indicates there's no connection coming into your equipment. But let's try a few things. Can you locate your modem for me? It should be a white box, probably near where your fiber comes into the house.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's over by the—yeah, I got it.

Agent: Great. What I'd like you to do is unplug the modem from the power outlet for about thirty seconds. Just pull it out completely.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about thirty seconds. While we're waiting, have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, this is the first time. Internet's been working fine until today. No storms or anything, if that's what you're asking.

Agent: Good information. That helps. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Now we're going to wait for it to boot back up. This can take a minute or two. What we're looking for is for the lights to come on, and the red light should change to either green or blue, indicating a good connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. Um... the lights came on, but... that red light is still there.

Agent: It's still red?

Customer: Yeah, still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) Can you tell me—do you see any other lights on the modem right now besides the red one?

Customer: There's like a green light on the bottom, but yeah, that red one is still solid red up top.

Agent: The red one on top is solid?

Customer: Yeah, solid.

Agent: Alright, that's still indicating a connection issue. Let me see if there's anything on my end. (typing sounds) One moment, please. (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any service alerts in your area, so the network looks good from here. I want to check one more thing. Can you look at where the fiber line connects to your modem? There should be a small cable plugged in. Is that cable still in there?

Customer: Yeah, the cable's in. I can see it.

Agent: And it looks like it's firmly seated? Not loose or anything?

Customer: No, it looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Okay. Let me try something else here. Can you check if there's a reset button on the modem? It should be a small indented button, usually on the back.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's like a tiny button.

Agent: Perfect. Now, I'm going to have you hold that down for about ten seconds. This is going to reset the modem to factory settings, so just be aware of that.

Customer: Got it. (pause) Okay, holding it down... (pause) ...releasing it now.

Agent: Great. Let's give it another minute to reboot. This might take a bit longer since we just did a factory reset.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Okay, I'm watching the lights come back up again... (longer pause) ...and, um... (sighs) ...that red light is back.

Agent: It's back to red again?

Customer: Yeah. I don't know what's going on. This is weird.

Agent: I understand. This is definitely unusual. Let me pull up your account information again here and see if there's anything I'm missing. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing your account here, and... (pause) ...I want to check something. Can you tell me if you've made any changes to your setup recently? Any new equipment, or did you move anything around?

Customer: No, no. Everything's been the same for like... I don't know, six months? We haven't touched anything.

Agent: Okay. And you said the green light came back on?

Customer: Yeah, there's a green one, but that red one is still there.

Agent: The red light being persistent even after the reset is telling me that the issue might be with the fiber connection itself, possibly either the cable connection or... it could even be something at the network terminal outside your house. This is unfortunately something that I can't fully diagnose over the phone.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you like, fix it remotely or something?

Agent: Let me try a couple more things first before we go that route. Can you check—actually, do you have a secondary device you can try? Like a phone or a tablet? Can you see if you can connect to the WiFi from the router?

Customer: (pause) Um, let me grab my phone... (pause) Okay, I don't even see the WiFi network showing up. Like, there's nothing to connect to.

Agent: Right, and that makes sense given what the modem is showing. The router isn't getting a signal from the modem because the modem doesn't have a connection. So unfortunately, that confirms what I suspected. I think we need to get a technician out there to take a look at this. It could be a problem with the fiber line, the connection point, or possibly the modem itself.

Customer: A technician? So like, how long is that going to take? I really need my internet back. I've got a client call tomorrow morning.

Agent: I understand. Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so the earliest I can get someone out is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow? That's... I mean, I guess it has to be, right? There's no way to get it done today?

Agent: Unfortunately, our technicians are booked solid for the rest of today. I wish I had something sooner for you. But tomorrow morning should hopefully get this resolved.

Customer: Alright, fine. Tomorrow between 8 and noon. What's the appointment number or whatever I need?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, your appointment number is 847291. The technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive. And just to confirm, you'll be home tomorrow morning, correct?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. And I do apologize for the inconvenience. I wish we could have gotten this resolved over the phone.

Customer: Yeah, me too. Well, thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright. Again, your appointment number is 847291 for tomorrow morning. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we apologize for the service interruption.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a good day.
