Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. One moment... Alright, I've got your account here. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning—do you know what time that was?

Customer: Yeah, around 7 AM or so. I got up, tried to check my email, and nothing. The modem's just sitting there not doing anything.

Agent: Okay, and you're seeing no lights on the modem at all, or are there lights but no internet connection?

Customer: Um, there are lights. I see like... a green light and a red light, I think? Or maybe it's orange. It's definitely not all green like it usually is.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the red or orange light—do you know which port that's on? Is it on the power light, the internet light, the WiFi...?

Customer: I'm not really sure. I'm not super technical with this stuff. There's just different colored lights blinking and... yeah, I don't really know which is which.

Agent: No problem, I get it. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, doing that now.

Agent: Great. Now let's leave that unplugged for about thirty seconds. I'll wait here with you.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, now go ahead and plug it back in. We're going to let it reboot.

Customer: (pause) Plugged back in. Now I'm just... waiting for it to start up again?

Agent: Exactly. You should see the lights start cycling through. Once they settle down and go to a steady green, let me know and we'll check your connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it now. It's lighting up... the lights are doing their thing... (longer pause) Alright, I think it's done. I'm seeing green lights now.

Agent: Excellent. Now can you open up your browser and try to go to a website? Try Google or something simple like that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me try... (pause) [inaudible] ...no, nothing's loading. It's still just... it's not working.

Agent: Alright, let's try a couple other things. Can you tell me—when you look at your computer, do you see any WiFi networks available?

Customer: Oh, uh... yeah, I see... let me look. I see my Frontier WiFi network showing up, so I guess that's a good sign?

Agent: That is a good sign, yes. Are you currently connected to it?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. I mean, the WiFi symbol on my computer shows that I'm connected, but the internet's not working.

Agent: Okay, so you're connected to the network but no internet. Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) Can you restart your computer for me? Just shut it down completely and boot it back up.

Customer: Yeah, I can do that. Is this gonna take long?

Agent: It shouldn't. Maybe a couple minutes for your computer to restart. I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: Okay, doing it now. (pause) It's shutting down... (longer pause) Alright, restarting now... (pause) Give me just one second... (pause) Okay, it's back up.

Agent: Perfect. Now try opening your browser again and navigating to that website.

Customer: (pause) Okay, Google... (pause) ...no, still nothing. The page is just blank and it says like, "no internet connection" or something.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Can you do me a favor and try unplugging your modem again? But this time, also unplug your router if you have a separate router.

Customer: Oh, I have one of those too? I mean... I think I do? There's like a box that has the WiFi label on it next to my modem.

Agent: That's probably it. Go ahead and unplug both of those for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, both unplugged now.

Agent: Wait about thirty seconds again, and then plug the modem back in first. Give that about a minute to boot up completely, and then plug the router in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, modem's in... waiting... (longer pause) Okay, and now the router's in. (pause) They're doing their light show again.

Agent: Good. Now let's give this a couple minutes to fully establish the connection. Can you try checking your connection again?

Customer: (longer pause) Still nothing. It's still showing no internet.

Agent: Okay, um... (pause) Let me pull up some diagnostics on our end here. (typing sounds) I'm checking our system for any outages in your area... (pause) So I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported. Let me check your specific account and connection status... (pause) Hmm.

Customer: What? What does that mean, "hmm"?

Agent: Well, I'm looking at your modem here, and it appears to be... it's showing as offline in our system. So even though you're seeing lights on your end, it's not actually communicating back to our network.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it broken?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be an issue with the modem itself, or it could be an issue with the line coming into your house. Um, let me ask you—have you noticed any physical damage to the cable outside your house? Or have there been any storms recently?

Customer: No storms that I know of, and I haven't really looked outside...

Agent: Could you take a quick look for me? Just check if there's a cable line running to your house and if it looks intact?

Customer: (pause) Hold on, let me go outside... (pause, background outdoor sounds) Okay, I'm outside. I'm looking at the cable. It looks fine to me. It's attached to the house and everything. I don't see anything obviously broken.

Agent: Alright, good. Let me try a few more things remotely. (typing sounds, longer pause) I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem right now.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Is something happening?

Agent: You should see the lights flicker or cycle again in a moment.

Customer: (pause) Oh yeah, the lights are doing something. They're blinking more than before.

Agent: Okay, that's the reset processing. Let me give that about a minute... (pause) Can you try your internet again?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. This is really frustrating. I have a meeting in like an hour and I need to get online.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm trying everything I can here. (pause) Okay, so at this point, I'm suspecting there might be a more serious issue with either the modem itself or possibly the line. I think we may need to get a technician out there to take a look.

Customer: A technician? How long is that going to take?

Agent: Let me check our availability... (typing sounds, pause) So the earliest I can get someone out to you would be tomorrow between 12 PM and 3 PM. Or, if you need something sooner, we might have someone available this evening after 5 PM, but I'm not able to guarantee that without checking further.

Customer: So I'm not getting internet today?

Agent: I'm really sorry, but based on what I'm seeing, I don't think we can resolve this over the phone. The modem's not communicating with our network, and I've walked through all the standard troubleshooting steps. It does seem like there's a hardware issue or a line issue that's going to need in-person attention.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, yeah... can you set me up for the technician visit? I guess tomorrow afternoon would work. I'll figure out my meeting situation.

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) So I'm booking a technician visit for tomorrow between 12 and 3 PM. Is there anything else I can help you with, or do you have any questions about the visit?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm just... yeah, I'm frustrated, but I understand. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. Our technician will get you taken care of tomorrow. Is the phone number on your account the best way to reach you if they need to contact you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for calling Frontier, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
