Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went out completely. Like, it's been down for about an hour now and I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get this figured out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm showing an account here under... Michael Torres?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. And just to confirm, you're at 412 Oakwood Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Okay, perfect. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router that look unusual? Are they on or off?

Customer: Um... (pause) Let me look over there. So I've got the modem right here. The power light is on, it's green. But the internet light, the one that usually blinks, it's just... it's not doing anything. It's completely off.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The internet light being off typically means there's no signal coming in. Before we go further, have there been any storms in your area recently, or any recent work done outside your home? Sometimes that can affect the fiber line.

Customer: No, no storms. Not that I've seen anyway. And no, nobody's been working outside. It was just working fine this morning and then when I tried to check my email this afternoon, nothing.

Agent: Alright. Let's try a few troubleshooting steps. First thing I want you to do is unplug the modem. Just pull the power cable out for me.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Yep, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about thirty seconds while that's unplugged. This helps reset it.

Customer: (pause) How much longer?

Agent: You can go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait for it to boot back up. That should take about two or three minutes. While we're waiting, let me ask... are you getting any error messages on your computer or phone?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Just no connection at all. I can't even see the Wi-Fi network showing up.

Agent: Okay. (pause) And the internet light on the modem, is it showing any signs of life yet?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... no, still nothing. It's still off.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, can you do me a favor and check if there's a small reset button on the back of the modem? Sometimes it has a little recessed button.

Customer: (pause) Oh, yeah, I see it. It's back here.

Agent: Okay, don't press it yet. A full reset is kind of a last resort because it'll clear your settings. But before we do that, let me just... (typing sounds) Let me check something on the system here.

Customer: What are you checking?

Agent: I'm looking at our network diagnostics on your line. And, um... actually, I'm not seeing any signal coming into your location at all. So it's not an issue with your modem specifically. It looks like the fiber line itself might be down.

Customer: Oh, no. So what does that mean? Can you fix that?

Agent: Well, the good news is if it's a line issue on our end, we can definitely get a technician out to look at it. But I do want to try one more thing before we schedule that. Let me have you try a different cable if you have one. Do you have another ethernet cable available?

Customer: Um, I might have one. Hold on a second. (pause) Okay, I found one. What do you want me to do?

Agent: Alright, go ahead and unplug the cable that's currently connected to the modem and plug in that different one. Just to rule out a faulty cable on your end.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged in now. (pause) But, I mean... nothing's changed. The light is still off.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Yeah, it's looking like the issue is definitely on the line side. Unfortunately, that's not something we can fix over the phone. What I'm going to do is get a technician scheduled to come out and diagnose the problem. Are you available tomorrow, or would you prefer a specific day?

Customer: Tomorrow would be great, actually. The sooner the better. I need my internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. (typing sounds) Let me get you scheduled. We have a window available between 8 AM and 12 PM tomorrow, or there's another slot between 2 PM and 6 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: The morning is better. Eight to noon.

Agent: Perfect. So I have you down for a technician visit tomorrow morning, 8 AM to 12 PM. A tech will come out and investigate the line. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. So I'll see someone tomorrow?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. You should see a Frontier technician tomorrow morning. They'll get you back online as quickly as possible. We really do apologize for the inconvenience, Michael.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.

Agent: You're very welcome. Have a good day, and thanks for being a Frontier customer.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Goodbye.
