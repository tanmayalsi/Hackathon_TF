# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just stopped working. Like, completely. I can't get online at all.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. And just to confirm, you're saying you have no internet connection at all right now, correct?

Customer: Right, yeah. Like, nothing. My WiFi isn't showing up, and I tried plugging directly into the modem with an ethernet cable and... nothing. It's been out for like an hour or so.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what you're seeing on your modem right now? Are there any lights on it?

Customer: Um... (pause) yeah, there's a... there's a red light. Just one red light, I think. Maybe two? It's a little confusing, to be honest.

Agent: That's all right. Do you know where the modem is located? Can you walk over to it for me?

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (background noise of footsteps) Okay, I'm here. So there's... there's like a power light that's red, and then there's another one that's kind of orange-ish. The rest don't seem to be on.

Agent: Got it. So the power light is red instead of green—that's typically what we want to see. Let me have you try something. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet and wait about 30 seconds, then plug it back in? That'll do a hard reset.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) How long do I wait?

Agent: About 30 seconds should do it. While you're waiting, is there a router separate from the modem, or is it all-in-one?

Customer: It's separate. I've got them both sitting next to each other.

Agent: Alright, so go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. Now what?

Agent: Now let's give it about a minute to boot back up. We should see the lights change. Let me know what you're seeing.

Customer: (pause) Uh-huh. So the power light is still red. And the... the orange one's still there too. Nothing's really changed. Should I have restarted the router too?

Agent: Let's try that as well. Go ahead and unplug the router—but wait until the modem lights have stabilized first. Just give it another 30 seconds or so.

Customer: Okay, how long has it been?

Agent: Why don't you give it another 20 or 30 seconds, just to be safe?

Customer: (pause) All right, I'm unplugging the router now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: (typing sounds) And while you're there, I'm going to check something on my end. Can you also check the cable connection? The one going from the wall outlet into the modem—can you make sure it's seated firmly?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me see... (background noise) It looks pretty snug. I mean, I'm not gonna pull too hard, but it seems fine to me.

Agent: That's good. Go ahead and plug the router back in now and let's give both devices a full minute to fully boot up.

Customer: All right. (pause) Should I... should I be seeing lights change or something?

Agent: You should see the modem lights cycle through a few different patterns as it boots up. It might take up to a minute for everything to stabilize.

Customer: (pause) Okay, um... I'm still just seeing that red power light and the orange one. There's... there's nothing else lighting up.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Let me ask you—did anything happen before this stopped working? Like a storm, a power outage, or anything like that?

Customer: No, not really. I mean, it was working fine this morning. I was using it all day and then like an hour ago it just... stopped. No warning or anything.

Agent: All right. Let me check the line status on this end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm seeing that we're not detecting a connection from your modem on our network right now. That could mean a few things. Have you checked if there are any other cables connected to the modem? Sometimes there are backup batteries or connections that can get loose.

Customer: Let me look... (pause) I don't think so? There's the power cable and then the cable from the wall. That's all I see.

Agent: Okay. And that cable from the wall—that's the coaxial cable, the one that looks kind of thicker?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one I checked already.

Agent: Right, you did. Let me try one more thing. Can you locate the reset button on the modem? It's usually a small button, sometimes recessed, often labeled "Reset" or "Restart."

Customer: (pause) I think I see it. It's like a really tiny button on the back here.

Agent: Yes, that's the one. I'm going to have you press and hold that for about 10 seconds. This is going to reset the modem back to factory settings, so just be aware of that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... (pause) How many seconds in?

Agent: Just keep holding. Ten seconds total.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) it's been about 10. I'm releasing it now.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait for the modem to boot up again and see what happens. This can take a minute or two.

Customer: (pause) All right. (long pause) Okay, so... the lights are doing something different now? Like flickering a bit?

Agent: That's normal—that's the boot-up process. Give it another 30 seconds or so and let me know if you see the power light turn green.

Customer: (pause) Still waiting... (pause) Nope. It's still red. (pause) This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand. (pause) Let me be honest with you—at this point, we've tried the standard troubleshooting steps. The fact that the modem isn't connecting to our network, combined with the light indicators you're seeing, suggests there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or possibly a service interruption on our end to your location.

Customer: So what does that mean? How do I fix it?

Agent: Well, I have a couple of options for you. One is to send a technician out to your location to diagnose the issue and potentially replace the equipment. That can usually be scheduled within the next 24 to 48 hours depending on availability. Or, if you'd like, we can mail you a replacement modem, though that would take a few business days to arrive.

Customer: How much is that gonna cost me?

Agent: The technician visit would be a service call fee—let me see here... (typing sounds) For your account, that would be $99. However, if it turns out to be a service-side issue—something on our network—that fee would be waived. The replacement modem by mail would not have any additional charge to you; we'd just ship it out.

Customer: (pause) So if I go with the replacement modem, how long before I have internet again?

Agent: It typically takes 3 to 5 business days for the modem to arrive once we ship it out. And then of course you'd need to set it up once it gets there.

Customer: Hmm. I don't really have that kind of time without internet. Can't you guys just come out sooner? Like today?

Agent: Let me check availability for emergency service calls. (typing sounds) (pause) Unfortunately, today's slots are all booked up. However, I can get you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and 6 PM if that works for you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess that's fine. But I'm still not thrilled about paying 99 dollars if it's your problem, you know?

Agent: Absolutely, I understand your frustration. Just to reiterate, if our technician determines that the issue is on the service side—with our network or infrastructure—the $99 fee will be completely reversed. You'll only pay if it's determined to be a modem hardware issue.

Customer: (pause) All right. Yeah, okay. Let's do the technician tomorrow then.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. So that's tomorrow, Saturday, anytime between 8 AM and 6 PM. We'll send you a confirmation text and email with all the details. A technician will reach out to you 30 minutes before they arrive. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can get me back online quickly.

Agent: I hope so too. We really appreciate your patience working through this with us. Your ticket number for reference is 447829. You can use that if you need to follow up with us. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
