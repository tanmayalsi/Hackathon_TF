# Frontier Communications Technical Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications technical support. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I see your account here. So your internet service is currently down. Can you tell me a little bit more about what you're experiencing? Like, are you seeing any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, yeah, I have the modem and router. Let me look at it... (pause) So the modem has a couple lights on it. I think one is red?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Which light is red? Is it the power light, the internet light, or the WiFi light?

Customer: I'm not really sure. There's just... there's one that's solid and one that's blinking, and I think one of them might be red. I'm sorry, I'm not super tech-savvy with this stuff.

Agent: No worries at all, that's what I'm here for. Let me walk you through this. Can you tell me, from left to right, what colors you see on the modem?

Customer: Okay so... (pause) I see a green one on the left, then there's a red one next to it, and then... I think there's an orange one on the right?

Agent: Got it. And which one is blinking?

Customer: The red one. The red one is blinking.

Agent: Okay, so the red light that's blinking typically indicates an internet connection issue. First thing I want you to do is unplug the modem from the power outlet. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds. Just to let it fully power down.

Customer: (pause) Okay... how much longer?

Agent: Just a few more seconds... go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it in. (pause) Okay, it's back on.

Agent: Good. Now while that's booting back up, let me ask you—did anything change with your setup recently? Like, did you have any weather or power outages in your area?

Customer: Um, we had some pretty bad weather last night, actually. Like, really heavy rain and wind. I didn't think about that, but yeah, that was happening.

Agent: That could definitely be a factor. Sometimes weather can affect the signal. Okay, so the modem should be booting up now. Are you seeing the lights changing at all?

Customer: Yeah, yeah I see them lighting up. So the green one is on, the orange one is on, but the red one is still blinking.

Agent: Still blinking, okay. Let me check our system here to see if there are any outages reported in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any active outages on our end. Alright, let's try the next step. I want you to check the cable connections in the back of your modem. Can you take a look at where the cable goes into the modem?

Customer: You mean like the cable from the wall?

Agent: Exactly, yes. The coaxial cable that connects from the wall outlet to the back of the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it. It seems pretty secure to me. It looks like it's screwed in pretty tight.

Agent: Good. And does the cable itself look damaged at all? Like any kinks, cuts, or [inaudible]?

Customer: No, no it looks fine from what I can see.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else. Can you try restarting your router as well? That's the separate device.

Customer: Oh, yeah sure. (pause) (background noise of device being unplugged) Okay, unplugged.

Agent: (pause) Great. Go ahead and plug that back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back on. (pause) Hmm, so... the modem still has that red blinking light. The router is booting up now though.

Agent: Okay, that's normal. Let's give it about a minute to fully boot back up and establish connection. While we're waiting, are you able to see if your computer or phone is picking up the WiFi signal?

Customer: Let me check my phone. (pause) Uh, no. No, it's not showing up.

Agent: Okay. And just to confirm, you're definitely trying to connect to your home WiFi and not something else?

Customer: Yeah, I'm definitely looking for it. The network just... it's not there.

Agent: Alright. I've got a couple more things we can try. Let me see if there's a reset button on your modem. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) I see a small button that says "Reset" on the back, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. Before we reset it though—and I want to make sure you understand this—resetting the modem will erase all your custom settings. But we can reconfigure it after. Are you okay with that?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I just want my internet back, so... yeah, let's do it.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Go ahead and hold down the reset button for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) It's resetting. All the lights are off now.

Agent: (pause) Good, that's normal. It should take a minute or two to fully restart. Let me explain what happens after this. Once it restarts, you'll need to contact our support team to get it fully activated and set up with your account information. But let me wait and see if we can get a connection first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, the lights are coming back on. (pause) Uh... the red one is still blinking though.

Agent: Still blinking, okay. (pause) Let me think about what else could be going on here. Given that you had the weather situation last night, it's possible that the issue is actually with the line coming from outside your house. That's something we would need to have a technician check. Let me check our availability for a technician visit. (typing sounds) (pause)

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet today if possible.

Agent: I understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm showing we do have a technician that could possibly come out today between 12 and 4 PM if that works for your schedule?

Customer: Yeah, that could work. Will they definitely be able to fix it?

Agent: A technician would be able to diagnose the issue more thoroughly than we can do over the phone. Given the weather and the symptoms you're describing, it's most likely an external line issue, which they can repair. But I can't guarantee a fix without them actually being here. 

Customer: Alright, okay. Yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get some information from you and get that scheduled. Is the phone number I have on file, 503-555-0147, still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's the right number.

Agent: Great. So I have a technician visit scheduled for today between 12 and 4 PM. You should receive a confirmation call or text shortly. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: I mean, is there anything else I can try to get it working before the technician comes?

Agent: At this point, honestly, I think we've tried the basic troubleshooting steps. The reset button was our last option before needing the technician, so I think your best bet is to wait for them. They'll have the proper tools to check the external lines and connections.

Customer: Okay, alright. Thank you for your help, I guess.

Agent: I wish I could have gotten you up and running today, but I really do think the technician will be able to resolve this for you. Is there anything else I can help you with before we end this call?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a great day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
