Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging everything and I'm not really sure what else to do.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account really quick here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me just... there we go. I've got you here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Uh, I'd say around... maybe 8 or 8:30? I went to check my email and nothing was loading.

Agent: Got it. And you mentioned you already tried unplugging things—that's great, actually. So when you look at your modem right now, what lights are you seeing on the front of it?

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me go look at it real quick.

Agent: No problem, take your time.

Customer: (sound of walking) Alright, so... there's a power light that's on, it's solid green. And then there's like... I think it's the internet light? That one's... it's not on at all. It's completely dark.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is green but the internet light is off. That's actually helpful information. And then do you see any other lights that are lit up?

Customer: Um, let's see... there's one that's like blinking, it looks red or orange maybe?

Agent: Red or orange and it's blinking?

Customer: Yeah, blinking.

Agent: Alright, so that's actually indicating an error status. That light—we call that the status light. When it's blinking red like that, it usually means the modem's having trouble connecting to our network. Let me ask you a couple quick questions. Are you able to see your WiFi network on your devices?

Customer: (pause) Let me check on my phone here... No, actually I don't see it. I don't see the Frontier network showing up at all.

Agent: Okay, that confirms what I'm thinking. The modem's not able to establish a connection to our network. So let's try a few things. First, can you tell me—is your modem plugged directly into the wall outlet?

Customer: Uh, it's plugged into a power strip actually.

Agent: Okay, if you don't mind, can you try unplugging it from the power strip and plugging it directly into the wall? Just to rule that out.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (sound of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged. I'm gonna plug it into the wall here.

Agent: Great. And then just give it about 60 seconds to boot back up and we'll see what lights we get this time.

Customer: Alright. (pause) So... now it's starting up again. I see the power light coming back on.

Agent: Perfect. Let's just give it another 30 seconds or so to fully initialize.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, so the power light is definitely solid green again. The other light, the status one... it's still blinking red though.

Agent: Still blinking red. Okay. Um, alright, well that's... that's not ideal, but let's try one more thing. I want you to do what we call a factory reset on the modem. What I need you to do is locate a small button—it's usually recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something to reach it—and hold it down for about 10 seconds while the modem is powered on.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking at the back of the modem... yeah, I see a little button here that says "Reset."

Agent: That's the one. So go ahead and press and hold that for 10 seconds.

Customer: (sound of rustling) Okay, holding it... 10 seconds... and release.

Agent: Good. Now the modem's gonna go through a restart cycle. This might take a couple minutes, so just kind of keep an eye on it and let me know what happens.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, so... the power light went out for a second and now it's back. But the status light... [inaudible] ...it's still red and blinking.

Agent: (typing sounds) Still red and blinking. Hmm. Okay, let me check something on my end here. (pause) Are you able to see if there's maybe a phone line or coax cable that connects from the wall into your modem? You should see like a cable coming in.

Customer: Yeah, there's a cable. It's, uh... it looks like it's plugged in pretty tight.

Agent: Okay, good. Can you try wiggling it just a little bit to see if it's a connection issue?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm jiggling it... nothing seems loose or anything.

Agent: Alright. And that cable—it goes directly from the wall jack, correct?

Customer: Yeah, straight from the wall.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at our network map on my end here and it's showing that we're not detecting your modem on the network at all right now. And honestly, that combined with the red status light is pointing to either a modem issue or possibly an outage in your area. Let me just check real quick if there are any reported outages. (typing sounds) (long pause) I'm not seeing any active outages in your area, so that's good news and bad news, I guess.

Customer: What do you mean?

Agent: Well, the bad news is it probably means something's going on with your modem itself. The good news is it's not a widespread network issue.

Customer: Oh. So... what do we do?

Agent: (pause) Yeah, so at this point, I think we're gonna need to get a technician out to you to either replace the modem or check the line coming into your house. Unfortunately, I can't really do much more troubleshooting from my end.

Customer: Really? (pause) How long does that usually take?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what availability we have. We can typically get someone out within the next 24 to 48 hours depending on your area. Let me check what days work best for you.

Customer: (frustrated) I really need this working sooner rather than later. I work from home and... yeah, I need internet.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry about that. Unfortunately, that's the soonest we have availability in your area. But I can put you down as a priority call. Let me get some information from you.

Customer: Alright, fine.

Agent: So what's the best number to reach you on?

Customer: It's the same number on the account, 555-0847.

Agent: Perfect. And what times work best for you tomorrow or the day after?

Customer: Um, tomorrow morning would be best, if that's possible.

Agent: Let me see... (typing sounds) Okay, I can get you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. So to recap, we have a technician visit scheduled for tomorrow, [inaudible], between 8 AM and noon. They'll assess your modem and the line connection. You'll get a confirmation call about an hour before they arrive.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: (pause) Honestly, at this point, I'd just say leave the modem as is. Don't keep resetting it or anything because that might complicate things when the tech gets there. Just... keep an eye on it and hopefully tomorrow we'll get you back up and running.

Customer: Alright. Well, I appreciate your help, even if we couldn't fix it right now.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't resolve this for you over the phone. But our technician will definitely take care of you tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for being a Frontier customer, and sorry again for the inconvenience. We'll see you tomorrow!

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
