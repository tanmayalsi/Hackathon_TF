Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I have to work from home today and I can't do anything without it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get this figured out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. So your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Um, around 8:30, maybe 8:45. I woke up, tried to check my email, and nothing. Just couldn't connect.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm, you're completely unable to connect, or are you getting any kind of signal at all?

Customer: Nothing. The modem... (pause) ...the modem isn't even showing that it has internet. Like, the light that's usually on is just off. It's just the power light that's on.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So the modem is powered on but the internet light is dark. Before we go further, have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in?

Customer: Actually, no. I didn't think of that. Hold on, let me go do that right now.

Agent: Sure thing. I'll be right here.

(pause - approximately 30 seconds of silence, then muffled sounds)

Customer: Okay, I just unplugged it. I'm gonna wait a few seconds... and plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give that a minute to boot back up. While we wait, can you tell me if you've had any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The power's been fine. My computer's working, TV's on... it's just the internet.

Agent: Got it. Alright, is the modem showing any lights now?

Customer: Yeah, the power light's back on. And uh... (pause) ...I'm waiting for the other lights to come on. Usually it takes a minute. There we go... I'm seeing the internet light again now. That's good, right?

Agent: That's a great sign. Now can you try connecting to the Wi-Fi and let me know if you can get online?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at my available networks... I see my Frontier Wi-Fi. Let me connect to it... (pause) ...it's asking for the password. Hold on, where did I... okay, got it. Entering the password now... (pause) ...and... no. No, it's not working. It's saying "unable to connect." That's weird.

Agent: Hmm, let's try a different approach. Do you happen to have an ethernet cable handy? That way we can test the connection directly from the modem.

Customer: Uh, yeah, I think I have one. Let me look... (pause) ...yes, I have one right here.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and plug that directly into the modem, and then plug it into your computer or laptop.

Customer: Okay, one second... (background noise of moving around, cable rustling) ...alright, it's plugged in. Let me just restart my computer real quick to make sure it recognizes the connection... (pause) ...okay, it's booting back up... (pause) ...and... no. No internet still. That's not good.

Agent: Okay, that tells us it might be more than just a Wi-Fi issue. Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) Can you look at the modem and tell me what color the internet light is right now?

Customer: It's... it's green. It looks green to me.

Agent: And is it steady or is it blinking?

Customer: It's blinking. On and off. On and off.

Agent: (pause) A blinking internet light usually indicates the modem is trying to sync with the network. Let me see... (typing sounds) ...I'm going to run a diagnostic on your line here. This'll just take a moment.

(pause - approximately 20 seconds)

Agent: Alright, so I'm not seeing any outages in your area, and your line appears to be active on our end. This is interesting. Can you tell me—do you have any devices, like a phone or tablet, that you can test the Wi-Fi connection on?

Customer: Yeah, my phone's right here. Let me try... (pause) ...no, same thing. It's not connecting.

Agent: Okay. Let me ask you this: Have you recently updated your modem, or has anything changed with your setup recently?

Customer: No, nothing's changed. It's all been working fine up until this morning. I didn't do anything different.

Agent: I understand. Alright, one more thing I'd like you to try. Can you unplug the modem again, and this time I want you to unplug the router as well if you have one separate from the modem?

Customer: Oh, I do have a separate router. You want me to unplug both?

Agent: Yes, please. Unplug both, wait about two minutes, and then plug the modem back in first. Give that about a minute to fully boot, and then plug the router in.

Customer: Alright, unplugging now. (pause) Both are unplugged. I'm going to wait... (pause, approximately 2 minutes of silence) ...okay, plugging the modem back in... (pause) ...and waiting for it to fully boot up. The lights are coming back on... internet light is green and steady now, which is different from before. That looks better. Now I'm plugging in the router... (pause) ...okay, now it's booting up. The lights are doing their thing... (pause) ...alright, everything looks like it's back to normal. Let me try connecting to Wi-Fi on my phone... (pause) ...connecting... (pause) ...it says connected! Let me try opening a web page... (pause) ...[inaudible] ...no, I'm not getting anything. The page won't load. It still doesn't work.

Agent: (pause) I'm sorry. Let me try one more troubleshooting step with you. I'm going to restart the diagnostic from this side. Can you give me one moment?

(typing sounds, pause approximately 30 seconds)

Agent: Okay, so on my end, I'm still showing your line as active, but I am noticing something unusual with the signal levels coming into your modem. The upstream levels are... they're a bit higher than they should be. This could indicate an issue with the line itself, possibly damage or degradation somewhere between your home and our network hub.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is there something wrong with the line?

Agent: It could be. Unfortunately, this isn't something we can fix over the phone. I think what we're going to need to do is send a technician out to your location to physically inspect the line and test the connection at the source. They'd be able to identify if there's any damage to the cable or if there's another issue causing this.

Customer: Oh, so I'm not getting internet today then?

Agent: I wish I had better news. Based on what we're seeing, a technician visit would be the best way to resolve this. I can schedule that for you. We have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or later in the afternoon between 1 PM and 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: (sigh) Tomorrow morning, I guess. Eight to twelve. Can you make sure they know it's urgent?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll make a note on your account that this is affecting your work situation. The technician will see that. Let me get your contact information to confirm the appointment. Are you still at 555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. Your appointment is confirmed for tomorrow, [inaudible] between 8 AM and 12 PM. Is there a best number to reach you if the technician needs to contact you before they arrive?

Customer: That number is fine.

Agent: Great. I do want to apologize for the inconvenience. I know this isn't ideal when you need to work from home. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying at least.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone. A technician will be out to help you tomorrow morning. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: Have a good day.
