Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I've got a meeting in like an hour and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking here... and I see your account. It shows you're on our Fiber 500 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have you had any power outages or storms in your area, or did anything unusual happen before it stopped working?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I just woke up and tried to check my email and... nothing. The modem's still lit up and everything looks normal from what I can tell, but there's just no connection.

Agent: Okay, so the modem has power. That's good. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on the modem right now? Are they green, red, amber... what colors are they?

Customer: Um... (pause) so I see a green light on the power, there's like a... it looks like an orange light where the internet symbol is, and then... I think there's a red light on one of the other ports.

Agent: Alright, so orange on the internet light is not ideal. That typically means it's either still trying to connect or there's a connection issue. Have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in?

Customer: Not yet, no. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and try that. Just unplug it from the wall, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. I'll be right here.

Customer: (background sounds of movement) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) ...and waiting. This is always so nerve-wracking, you know?

Agent: (chuckles) I totally understand. I hear that all the time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Alright, it's rebooting. The power light came on again...

Agent: Take your time. Just let it boot up all the way. That usually takes a couple minutes. While we're waiting, did you notice if there were any outages in your area? Did your neighbors mention anything?

Customer: Um, I don't think so. I mean, I haven't talked to anyone, but my landlord's apartment is next to mine and I'm pretty sure their lights were on this morning.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. (pause) How's the modem looking now?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the power light is green again, but... that internet light is still orange. It hasn't changed.

Agent: Still orange. Hmm. Let me try a couple other things. Can you check the cables for me? There should be a cable coming from the wall into the modem—we call that the fiber optic cable. Can you see if it's connected securely on both ends?

Customer: (background sounds) Yeah, yeah, I see it. It's... let me check. (pause) It looks like it's connected. At least from what I can see it seems to be in there pretty tight.

Agent: Is the cable itself in good condition? Like, no cracks or [inaudible] visible damage?

Customer: No, looks fine to me. I mean, I don't really know what I'm looking for, but it looks... normal?

Agent: That's fine. Okay, can you also check the ethernet cable that goes from the modem to your router, if you have one? Is that connected?

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) wait, I actually don't have a separate router. I'm just using the modem directly connected to my computer with ethernet.

Agent: Got it, that's fine. So that cable from the modem to your computer—is that plugged in?

Customer: Yeah, it's connected. I checked.

Agent: Okay. Can you try unplugging that ethernet cable for about 10 seconds and then plugging it back in?

Customer: (pause) Sure. (background sounds) Unplugging... waiting... (pause) okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Nope, still nothing. I'm not getting any internet.

Agent: Alright. Let me try to access your modem remotely to see if I can get more information about what's happening. Can you go to your browser and type in 192.168.100.1? That's the IP address for your modem.

Customer: (typing sounds) Okay, typing that in now. (pause) It's... loading... (pause) ...and it timed out. It won't load anything.

Agent: It won't load. Okay. (pause) Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm looking at your account and I'm actually not seeing any active service on your line right now. That's concerning. Can you tell me—when was the last time you paid your bill?

Customer: Wait, what? No, my bill's always on autopay. I know it's set up that way.

Agent: Let me see here... (typing sounds) (pause) I do see that on file, yes. So that's not the issue. But it's showing me that your service was deactivated sometime last night around 11 PM. Do you have any idea why that might be?

Customer: No! I mean, I didn't do anything. This doesn't make any sense. Why would your system just deactivate my service?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me look into this a little bit more. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing a note here that says our network team was doing some maintenance in your area last night. It's possible that something went wrong during that and your service got interrupted. 

Customer: So what do I do? Can you just... turn it back on or something?

Agent: That's exactly what I'm going to try to do. Let me reactivate your service on the line. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm sending the signal now to bring your service back online. It should take just a minute or two to fully activate.

Customer: Okay, great. Um, how will I know when it's working?

Agent: Well, that orange light on your modem should turn green. You should see the internet light change to green. Keep an eye on that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. (pause) ...Still orange. (pause) Still orange.

Agent: Give it just a moment longer. Sometimes it takes a few minutes.

Customer: (pause) How long are we talking? Like... (pause) ...No, still orange. Derek, it's still orange.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let me check. (typing sounds) (long pause) Hmm. This is strange. My system is showing that the service should be active now, but I'm not seeing a connection being established on the line. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it just going to randomly come back on or...?

Agent: That's... that's a good question. I want to be honest with you—I'm not entirely sure why it's not connecting. This might be a hardware issue on our end, or there could be something else going on with the line itself. I think what we need to do is get a technician out to your location to physically check the connection.

Customer: A technician? How long is that going to take? I have this meeting in like forty-five minutes.

Agent: I understand. Let me see what we have available for same-day appointments. (typing sounds) (pause) What's your address?

Customer: It's 1247 Maple Street, Apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at our schedule and unfortunately our next available appointment in your area isn't until tomorrow between 12 PM and 3 PM. I'm really sorry.

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... that's not going to work for me. I need internet today.

Agent: I completely understand how frustrating this is. This appears to be something that requires an in-person visit to diagnose. If you'd like, I can put in a priority request to see if we can get someone out there sooner, but I can't guarantee anything before tonight.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) So what are you saying? There's nothing you can do?

Agent: Unfortunately, at this point, the troubleshooting we can do remotely isn't resolving the issue. There may be a problem with the fiber line itself or the connection at the network interface device outside your apartment. A technician will need to come out and check all that equipment.

Customer: This is unbelievable. How is this even happening?

Agent: I know, and I'm really sorry. What I can do is set you up with that appointment for tomorrow, and I can make a note that you're requesting priority service to see if we can get someone out today. Can I go ahead and book you for tomorrow from 12 to 3?

Customer: (pause) Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. I mean, I don't have much of a choice, do I?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, December 14th, between 12 PM and 3 PM at 1247 Maple Street, Apartment 3B. I've also added a priority service note. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. A technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Okay. Anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: Honestly, I'd just leave everything powered off until the technician gets there tomorrow. Don't keep restarting things. Let me make sure I have your contact information correct. The phone number on file is 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: And an email address?

Customer: It's [inaudible] at gmail dot com.

Agent: Okay, got it. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I guess not. I just hope they figure out what's wrong tomorrow.

Agent: I hope so too. Again, I'm really sorry you're dealing with this today, especially with your meeting. Is there any way you could get internet from a café or somewhere nearby to get through your meeting?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess I could do that. I didn't even think of it.

Agent: That might be your best option for today. Again, really sorry for the inconvenience.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, I guess. I'll talk to you tomorrow hopefully.

Agent: Sounds good. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. Take care!

Customer: Yeah, bye.

Agent: Bye!
