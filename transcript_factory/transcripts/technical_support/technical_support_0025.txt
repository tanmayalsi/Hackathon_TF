Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I'm working from home today and I can't do anything without it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. And your name is...?

Customer: James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. Thanks for that. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was approximately?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 8 o'clock? Maybe 8:15. I turned my computer on and nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Alright, and have you tried restarting your modem and router yet?

Customer: Yeah, I did that right away. Unplugged them both, waited like five minutes, plugged them back in. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting there. Um, so when you look at your modem right now, what lights are you seeing? Are any of them lit up?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, so there's... the power light is on, that's green. But, uh, the internet light? That one's not on. It's just dark.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on but no internet light. That's helpful information. And your router—do you see any lights on that one?

Customer: The router has some lights on. The power's on, the WiFi lights are... I think they're blinking? It's kind of hard to tell from where I'm sitting.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright. Let me just check your line here on our end. (pause) Hmm, that's strange. I'm not seeing any outages in your area, and your account shows the service should be active. Can you do me a favor and take a look at the cables going into your modem? Just make sure they're all plugged in nice and tight.

Customer: Okay, yeah, let me... (rustling sounds) I'm looking at the back here. There's a power cable, and then there's like a coax cable coming in from the wall. Both look pretty secure to me.

Agent: Alright, and you said the modem power light is green, correct?

Customer: Yeah, it is.

Agent: Okay, and just to confirm—you're only seeing the power light on the modem, nothing else?

Customer: That's right. Just the power light. Everything else is dark.

Agent: Got it. Let me try a couple more things. Do you have a computer or a phone you could try connecting to the WiFi, just to verify the router isn't broadcasting?

Customer: (pause) I mean, I could try my phone. Just give me one second here... (pause) Okay, so my WiFi network is showing up, but when I try to connect... it's saying it can't connect to the network. So I'm not getting internet that way either.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm. Okay, that tells me the router is at least powered on and trying to broadcast, but there's no internet signal coming from the modem. When was the last time you had internet working? Was it yesterday?

Customer: Yeah, yesterday afternoon it was working fine. And then this morning, nothing.

Agent: Right. And nothing has changed with your setup? No storms or power outages last night?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of, no. Weather's been pretty nice, actually.

Agent: Okay. Um, let me try something here. I'm going to send a refresh signal to your modem and see if that helps get it back online. Just give me a couple minutes.

Customer: (pause) Okay, sure.

Agent: (pause) Alright, that went through. Can you do me a favor and check those lights on your modem again?

Customer: (pause) Uh, no change. Still just the power light.

Agent: (pause) Still just the power light. Okay. James, I'm going to be honest with you—this is pointing to either a line issue on our end or possibly a modem hardware failure. Have you had this modem for a long time?

Customer: I think it's been... I don't know, maybe three years? It came with the original installation.

Agent: Okay. And it's been working fine up until this morning?

Customer: Yeah, zero problems.

Agent: Right. So here's what I'm thinking. We could either send a technician out to your location to check the line and the equipment, or... actually, since we can't get a signal to your modem, the line issue is definitely a possibility here. I don't think a refresh is going to help. Have you checked your bill recently? Is there anything past due that might have triggered a service suspension?

Customer: (slight irritation) No, my bill's paid. I always pay my bill on time. That's not it.

Agent: I didn't mean to imply anything, I just have to ask. I apologize. Let me see if I can schedule a tech visit for you. When would be convenient? Are you free tomorrow, or...?

Customer: (pause) I mean, I need this today if possible. I can't work without internet. This is pretty urgent.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check what we have available for same-day appointments. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so... I'm looking at our schedule and unfortunately our next available same-day window is between 5 and 9 PM this evening. Would that work for you?

Customer: That's pretty late, but I guess... I don't really have a choice, do I?

Agent: I know it's not ideal. Unfortunately, that's all we have available today. The technician would be able to diagnose the issue and potentially get you back up and running. If it does turn out to be the modem, they can replace it on the spot.

Customer: Okay. Fine. Let's do the 5 to 9 window.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get some information for that appointment. Can I get a callback number for the technician?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147, same as the account.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm the address they'll be coming to... (typing sounds) ...this is 4521 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, James, I'm going to get this scheduled for you. You should receive a text and an email confirmation with your appointment details. The technician will also call about 30 minutes before they arrive so you're not caught off guard.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: Um, you could try one more restart of the modem if you'd like, but honestly, given that you're not seeing any internet light and the signal on our end isn't reaching your equipment, I think the tech visit is really your best bet. I don't think there's much more we can troubleshoot remotely.

Customer: (sigh) Alright. I'm just frustrated because I really need to work today.

Agent: I understand completely. Hopefully the technician will be able to resolve this quickly for you this evening. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll just... wait for them tonight, I guess.

Agent: Alright. Well, James, I really appreciate your patience, and I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. Your appointment is all set for today between 5 and 9 PM. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we hope to get your service back up quickly.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
