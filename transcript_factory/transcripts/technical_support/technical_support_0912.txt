Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. My internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 2341 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So your internet service is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely. Nothing. No lights on the router or anything. I checked all the cables and everything seems plugged in, but there's just... nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) So I'm showing you have our Frontier Fiber 500 plan. That's excellent service when it's working, I promise you. (chuckles) Let me ask you a few questions. When you say there are no lights on the router, can you describe which lights you're looking at?

Customer: Um, it's the white box? On the front there are usually some lights that blink and stuff. Right now, nothing's on at all.

Agent: Okay, so the router appears to be completely powered down. Have you checked the power cable? Is it securely connected to both the router and the wall outlet?

Customer: Yeah, I already looked at that. It's plugged in. I even tried a different outlet, same thing.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your modem and... hmm. I'm not seeing any active connection from our side either. That could indicate a few different things. Let me have you try a hard reset on the equipment. Can you unplug the power cable from the router?

Customer: Okay, give me one second... (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now I need you to leave it unplugged for about two minutes. Just... set a timer or something, okay? This helps clear the system.

Customer: Alright, I'll wait. (pause) So while we're doing this, do you know what might be wrong? Is it on my end or is it a service outage or something?

Agent: Good question. I don't have any outages reported in your area, so it's likely something with either your equipment or the line itself. Could be a few different things—we'll figure it out. Two minutes up?

Customer: I mean, it's only been like... thirty seconds?

Agent: Oh, no problem. (chuckles) Sorry about that. Go ahead and grab a cup of coffee or something.

Customer: (laughs) Yeah, okay. (pause) Alright, it's been two minutes.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug the router back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it in now. (pause) Still nothing. The lights aren't coming on at all.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Still nothing. That's... that's unusual actually. Let me ask you this—do you have access to the fiber connection box outside your house at all? It might be mounted on the exterior wall or near your electrical box.

Customer: Um, I think there's something outside, yeah. There's like a white box by the garage. Is that it?

Agent: That could be it. Is there a blue light on it? Or any kind of light indicator?

Customer: (pause) Oh, actually... no, wait. It's completely dark too. Nothing's on.

Agent: Okay, and that box should definitely have some kind of indicator light. It sounds like there might be an issue with the line coming into your house, or possibly with that optical network terminal—that's what we call that box. The fact that nothing is powering on is... (pause) ...is telling me this might be beyond what we can troubleshoot over the phone.

Customer: What do you mean? So what, I just have no internet?

Agent: Well, here's what I can do. I can file a service ticket for a technician to come out to your location. They'll be able to check the ONT—that's the box outside—and verify the line coming into your house. They can also check all the internal equipment.

Customer: How long is that going to take? I work from home, so I really need this fixed today.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) We have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or... (pause) ...we could potentially get someone out today, but it would be after 5 PM. It would be closer to 6 or 7 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning. What's the earliest they could be there?

Agent: The window opens at 8 AM. I can't guarantee an exact time, but that's when they'll start making calls.

Customer: (sighs) Okay. Yeah, let's do tomorrow morning then.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. Can I get a callback number to confirm this appointment?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Great, and is that a cell phone or a landline?

Customer: It's my cell.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap, I have a service ticket scheduled for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM window, and we'll call you before the technician arrives. The ticket notes indicate that your ONT and router are not powering on despite multiple reset attempts, so they'll need to investigate the line and the equipment.

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. Um, is there anything else I should try before they get here?

Agent: You know, let me think... (pause) You could try unplugging the battery backup if there's one attached to the ONT outside, but honestly, if there's no power indicators at all, it's probably not going to make a difference. The technician will be better equipped to handle it.

Customer: Alright, well... I guess I'll just have to wait until tomorrow then.

Agent: I know this isn't ideal, especially working from home, but our technician should be able to get you sorted out quickly. In the meantime, if you have a smartphone, you could use your mobile hotspot as a backup if you absolutely need connectivity for something urgent.

Customer: Yeah, I might have to do that. Okay, well... thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone. I know it's frustrating. Your confirmation number for tomorrow is 847923. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. I'll just see you tomorrow.

Agent: Sounds good. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow morning. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
