Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just stopped working about an hour ago and I've tried unplugging everything and plugging it back in but nothing's happening.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what name is this account under?

Customer: Michael. Michael Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. Thanks for that. So you mentioned your internet went down about an hour ago. Just to clarify, do you have a modem and router, or do you have one combined unit?

Customer: Um, I think it's just one unit? It's that white box thing... I'm not really sure to be honest.

Agent: That's okay. So when you unplugged it, how long did you leave it unplugged before plugging it back in?

Customer: Maybe... thirty seconds? Should I have waited longer?

Agent: Yeah, actually, let's try that. Go ahead and unplug it completely and just leave it unplugged for about two minutes this time. That'll give it a full reset.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we wait, let me ask you a few more questions. Are there any lights on the modem right now?

Customer: No, nothing. It's dark.

Agent: Perfect, that's what we want. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (background noise of device plugging in) Alright, it's plugged in.

Agent: Okay, and just give it about thirty to forty-five seconds to boot up. You should see some lights start to come on.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, yeah I see some lights now. There's a blue light and a green light.

Agent: Good. Is the green light solid or is it blinking?

Customer: It's... blinking. It's blinking green.

Agent: Okay, blinking green is normal while it's booting up. Give it another minute or so to fully initialize.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) Um, the green one's still blinking though. It's been like a minute now.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) Michael, I'm not showing any active connection from your modem right now. Do you have a model number on that device? It should be somewhere on a sticker.

Customer: Let me look... okay, I see it. It says FRO-5891.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I have that model. And just to confirm, you're getting the blue light and blinking green, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Alright, and when you look at the modem, is there a power button on it?

Customer: There's like a button that says... I dunno, it just has a little symbol on it. Looks like a circle maybe?

Agent: That's probably it. Don't press that right now. Let me check something. (pause) Michael, I'm looking at our system and I'm actually not seeing any signals coming from your modem to our network at all. This might be a hardware issue, but let me try one more thing before we go down that road. Do you have any cables connected to the back of the modem?

Customer: Yeah, there's definitely cables. There's like a thick one coming from the wall and then another cable goes to my computer.

Agent: Okay, good. The thick one from the wall is your primary connection. I want you to unplug that cable from the modem and then plug it back in, nice and firmly.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, it's back in. Is that supposed to help?

Agent: It should help reseat the connection. Let's wait another thirty seconds and see if anything changes.

Customer: (pause) Nope, same thing. Still got the blue and the blinking green.

Agent: (sigh) Okay. Michael, I'm gonna be honest with you here. We're not seeing any registration from your modem on our network, which usually means either the cable line itself is having an issue, or the modem has encountered a hardware failure. I do want to try one last thing before we potentially schedule a technician visit.

Customer: What's that?

Agent: I want to see if we can do a factory reset on the modem. This will erase all the settings, but it might help get it reconnected. The downside is you might lose your WiFi for a bit.

Customer: How do I do that?

Agent: There should be a small pinhole button on the back of the modem, usually near the power port. It might be labeled "reset." I'll need you to hold that in for about ten seconds with a paperclip or something thin.

Customer: (pause) Oh yeah, I think I see it. I'm gonna need to grab something to press it.

Agent: Sure, go ahead.

Customer: (background noise, drawer opening) Okay, I got a paperclip. (pause) Alright, I'm gonna press it now.

Agent: Go ahead and hold it for the full ten seconds, Michael.

Customer: (pause, [inaudible] counting) Okay, ten seconds. (beeping sound) Oh, there's a beeping noise.

Agent: That's normal, that means the reset is happening. Go ahead and let go.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Now what?

Agent: Now we wait. The modem should restart completely. This might take a couple minutes. Just watch for the lights to come back on.

Customer: (long pause) Still nothing yet. Still blinking. How much longer?

Agent: Give it another minute or so.

Customer: (pause) Derek? Still blinking. Same as before.

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, Michael, I'm still not seeing any connection from your end. Unfortunately, at this point I think we've exhausted the troubleshooting steps I can do remotely. This is pointing to either a problem with the line coming to your house or a defective modem unit.

Customer: So what do I do? I need my internet for work.

Agent: I totally understand. I can definitely schedule a technician to come out and take a look. They can test the line and either get the modem working or replace it if needed.

Customer: How soon can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) The earliest I'm showing is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? Yeah, I guess that's fine.

Agent: Great. Let me get you set up for that. So just to recap, we have a technician visit scheduled for tomorrow, 8 AM to noon, at 555-0147. You don't need to do anything else right now. When the tech arrives they'll run some diagnostics and get this sorted out for you.

Customer: Okay. Is there gonna be a charge for this visit?

Agent: Since we've determined this could be a line issue or equipment failure and you haven't made any changes to the setup yourself, the technician visit should be covered. If it does turn out to be something else, the tech will let you know.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. Anything I should do before they get there?

Agent: Just leave the modem plugged in as is. The tech will want to see it in that state. And make sure someone's home to let them in. They'll give you a call about thirty minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Got it. Thanks for trying to help.

Agent: Of course, Michael. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working remotely, but the tech tomorrow should have you back up and running. Is there anything else I can help with?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good evening.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
