# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been trying to figure it out, but nothing's working.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And your name?

Customer: It's James. James Patterson.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, James, I've got your account here. I can see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So your internet just went out this morning, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around like... I dunno, 8 or 9 AM? I tried unplugging the router and everything, but it's still not working.

Agent: Okay, good. Good that you tried that already. Let me ask you a few questions first. Do you see any lights on your modem right now? Can you describe what you're seeing?

Customer: Um, yeah, hold on. (pause) Okay, so the power light is on—that's green. But the... the internet light, I think? The one that usually blinks? It's not on at all. It's just dark.

Agent: Okay, so the internet indicator is completely off. That's helpful information. And the modem—is that the white box that usually sits by your router?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, the white one. Both of them are plugged in. I checked that.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, let me try a couple of things. First, I'm going to check our systems on my end to see if there's anything going on in your area. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay... I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported in your zip code, so it looks like it might be specific to your location. 

Let me have you try a hard reset of the modem. Can you unplug the power cable from the back of the modem?

Customer: Sure, just unplug it?

Agent: Yeah, just completely unplug it from the wall outlet or the back of the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait for about 30 seconds while it powers down completely. I know it seems like a long time, but it helps clear out the system.

Customer: (pause) Alright, 30 seconds... (pause) ...okay, I think that's enough.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) Now I'm seeing... the power light is green again, but... (pause) ...nope, the internet light still isn't coming on.

Agent: Okay, hmm. Let's give it just a moment. Sometimes it takes about a minute or so to fully boot up and establish connection. Why don't we wait maybe 60 seconds and then check again?

Customer: Alright. (pause) (background noise of waiting) Okay, so... no, it's still off. Still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Alright, and your router—the one that usually broadcasts the WiFi? Does that have any lights on it at all?

Customer: The router? Let me look... (pause) No, I don't think so. No lights on that one either.

Agent: Okay, so nothing on the router. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) (pause) The modem needs to be connected to the router with an ethernet cable—is that cable still plugged in on both ends?

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) Let me check. I mean, I haven't touched anything, but... (pause) Yeah, it looks like it's connected. It's the yellow cable, right?

Agent: Yellow or blue, either one. As long as it's a cable that looks like a thick telephone cord.

Customer: Yeah, that's it. It's still plugged in.

Agent: Alright. Okay, here's what I want to try next. I'm going to power cycle everything at once. So unplug both the modem and the router this time, and we'll wait 30 seconds again.

Customer: Both of them?

Agent: Yeah, both devices. Unplug them completely.

Customer: (pause) Okay, they're both unplugged.

Agent: Great. So we're going to wait 30 seconds for them to fully discharge. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, modem's in.

Agent: And wait about 30 seconds for that to fully boot up before you plug in the router.

Customer: Uh, this is taking a while. (pause) Okay, how much longer?

Agent: Just another 20 seconds or so.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I think that's good.

Agent: Perfect. Now plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, router's plugged in. (pause) I'm waiting for... (pause) Nope. Same thing. The internet light on the modem still isn't on.

Agent: (pause) Okay. So it's still not lighting up. Alright, James, let me try something else here. I'm going to check the line from our side and see if we're actually delivering signal to your modem. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm... (pause) I'm showing that we are sending signal to your modem on our end. So the issue is probably... (pause) ...either with the modem itself or possibly with the line coming into your house.

Can you check—do you know where the outside line connects to your house? It might be on the side of your house or in a box?

Customer: Uh... I mean, there's a box on the side of the house. I've never really looked at it though. You want me to go check?

Agent: Yeah, if you could. Just take a quick look and see if there are any loose cables or if anything looks damaged or out of place.

Customer: (pause) (background noise fading) Okay, so... I'm looking at it, and... I don't know, it looks normal to me? There's some cables but they all seem connected.

Agent: Okay, can you see if there's a small LED light on the box itself? Sometimes there's a little indicator light.

Customer: (pause) Oh, yeah, there is a light. It's red.

Agent: It's red? Okay, that's... (pause) ...that's not ideal. Red usually means there's an issue with the connection on the line side. 

James, I think what we're dealing with here might be an issue with the line coming into your house. I'd like to get a technician out there to take a look at it. That way we can check the outside connection and possibly replace any damaged equipment.

Customer: Oh man, really? How long does that take? I need my internet for work.

Agent: I understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) I can get someone out there... it looks like we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or Wednesday afternoon between 1 PM and 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning is better. Can you do that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely. I'm scheduling a technician visit for tomorrow, 8 AM to noon. They'll come out and diagnose what's happening with the line and get you back up and running.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Um, is there anything else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: Unfortunately, based on what we're seeing, it does seem like it's a physical line issue, so trying more resets probably won't help. Just leave everything plugged in and powered on so the technician can see the current state when they arrive tomorrow. 

You should receive a text confirmation shortly with the appointment details and a window for when the technician will arrive. Is that the best number to reach you at?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, 555-0847. That's my cell too.

Agent: Perfect. You should get that confirmation in just a few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying.

Agent: You're welcome, James. We'll get you back online tomorrow. Have a great day.

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
