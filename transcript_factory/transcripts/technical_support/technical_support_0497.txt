# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out completely about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm finding you here... and I've got you down for our Fiber 200 plan. Is that still the service you're on?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So when you say the internet went out, do you have any lights on your modem right now? Like, is it powered on?

Customer: Um, yeah, let me look... (pause) Okay, so I see the power light is on, that's green. But the internet light—I think it's supposed to be blue? That one's not on. It's just... off.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So the power is on but we're not seeing that connection light. That tells me there might be a connectivity issue. Let me walk you through some troubleshooting steps real quick. First, can you unplug the modem from the power source?

Customer: The back of it?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Just pull the plug out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, done.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds for it to fully power down. While we're waiting—have there been any recent storms in your area, or any power outages?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of, no. It's been pretty clear today actually.

Agent: Alright, good. That rules out a few things. Go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in... (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about a minute or two to boot back up. You should start seeing some lights come back on. Can you watch and tell me what you see?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, so the power light came back, that's green again. And I'm waiting for... okay, the internet light is... still not coming on. Nothing else is lighting up either, which is weird.

Agent: Hmm, okay. And you mentioned you tried a few things before calling us—what exactly did you try?

Customer: Well, I restarted my computer, I unplugged everything, I waited like five minutes and plugged it back in. I checked if any of the cables were loose but they all look fine to me.

Agent: That's good troubleshooting on your part. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any service issues in your area, so it's not a network outage on our end. Let me ask you this—are you able to see the WiFi network name on your phone or computer, or is that completely gone too?

Customer: Completely gone. Like, when I try to scan for networks, there's nothing there.

Agent: Okay. What kind of modem do you have? Is it the Frontier-branded one, or...?

Customer: It's the white box thing with "Frontier" written on it. I'm not sure of the exact model.

Agent: That's the one I expected. Can you take a look at the back of the modem for me? There should be some ethernet cables—how many do you have plugged in?

Customer: I've got... (pause) looks like one cable coming in from the wall, and then I have my router plugged into one of the ethernet ports on the back.

Agent: Okay, so you're using a separate router, that's fine. Let me ask—is the router powering on and lighting up normally?

Customer: Yeah, the router's fine. All its lights are on.

Agent: Alright, here's what I want you to do. Can you unplug the ethernet cable from between the modem and the router?

Customer: Why's that gonna help?

Agent: Well, if we can get the modem to connect on its own first, that tells us where the problem is. So just unplug that cable between the two.

Customer: (pause) Done. Unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now give it about thirty seconds and let me know if you see that internet light come on on the modem.

Customer: (pause) Still waiting... (pause) No, nothing. Still dark.

Agent: Still nothing? Okay. And that cable coming in from the wall—that's the coaxial cable, the one that looks kind of thick?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. It's definitely plugged in tight.

Agent: Can you try unplugging that and plugging it back in for me?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Okay, unplugging it... and... (pause) okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Alright. I'm going to be honest with you, it sounds like there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or potentially a line issue on our end that's not showing up on the network monitoring. I want to try one more thing though. Do you have another phone or device you could try connecting to WiFi on?

Customer: Uh, I could try my phone? Let me grab it.

Agent: Perfect.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I've got my phone here. I'm looking at available networks and I'm not seeing anything. The modem's just not broadcasting anything at all.

Agent: Yeah, that confirms it. The fact that there's no WiFi signal and that internet light isn't coming on tells me the modem isn't connecting to our network. (typing sounds) Let me check our system one more time here to see if there's anything on the line... (pause) Nope, I'm not seeing any issues recorded. 

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It most likely means there's something wrong with the modem itself. It could be a hardware failure. The good news is, we can send you a replacement device. The bad news is, with our current schedule, the earliest we can get a technician out to you or get you a new modem is... let me see... (pause) that would be three business days from now.

Customer: Three days? I don't have internet for three days?

Agent: I understand that's not ideal. Let me see if there's anything else I can try. Can you check—when you look at the back of the modem, is there a small reset button? It might be recessed.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's a tiny little hole.

Agent: Okay, we can try a factory reset as a last-ditch effort. You'll need something like a paperclip to press it. Just press and hold it for about ten seconds. Be aware this will erase any configuration on the modem, but at this point it's worth a shot.

Customer: Okay, let me find a paperclip... (pause) I'm gonna hold it down now... (pause) ...counting... (pause) okay, I'm letting go.

Agent: Alright, now let's give it a minute to reboot.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) the power light's on again... (pause) but I'm still not seeing that internet light come on. This is ridiculous.

Agent: I know, I'm sorry. (pause) Okay, I think we've exhausted what we can do remotely. I'm going to process a modem replacement for you. Can I get your best email address on file to send you the confirmation?

Customer: It's [inaudible]... no wait, it's james.rivera@email.com.

Agent: Perfect. James, I'm going to get that modem shipped out to you today via overnight shipping if that's available. You should have it by tomorrow afternoon. In the meantime, I'm going to note this on your account so we don't charge you for the service interruption.

Customer: Okay, well, I guess that's something. Will I need to do anything special when it arrives?

Agent: It should come with instructions, but essentially you'll just plug it in the same way you plugged in the old one. And if you have any issues when it arrives, just give us a call back.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate that. When will I get the email confirmation?

Agent: You should see that within the next fifteen minutes or so. Your confirmation number is 847392. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it, I guess.

Agent: Well, I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today, James. Thank you for your patience, and we appreciate your business with Frontier. You have a good day.

Customer: You too. Thanks.

Agent: Thanks for calling Frontier Communications. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
