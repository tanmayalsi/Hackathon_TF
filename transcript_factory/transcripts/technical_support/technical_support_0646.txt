Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I work from home and this is kind of a problem.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at account for... is this James Mitchell?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember approximately what time that happened?

Customer: I'd say around 8:30 or so. I was about to hop on a call with my team and everything just... went out. The modem and router are both still lit up though. The lights are on.

Agent: Okay, that's good information. So your equipment is powered on. Let me ask you a few questions. Are you able to see any lights on the modem that might indicate internet connection? Usually there's a light labeled "internet" or "online."

Customer: Um, yeah, there's like... (pause) ...a blue light on the left side. But it's not blinking like it usually does. It's just solid.

Agent: Okay, so that solid blue light tells me the modem might not be establishing a connection with our network. That's actually helpful. Have you noticed any outages in your area, or has anything unusual happened recently? Any storms or construction work?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine all morning. I mean, I live in a pretty quiet area, so probably no construction either.

Agent: Alright. Let's try a few things. First, I want you to unplug the modem directly from the power outlet. Just pull it out completely.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...done. Should I wait?

Agent: Yes, let's wait about thirty seconds. This will allow the modem to fully power down and reset. While we're waiting, can you tell me—have you had any service issues with us in the past, or is this pretty new?

Customer: No, this is actually the first real problem I've had since I switched over about four months ago. Service has been solid up until now.

Agent: Great, so we're working with a pretty stable account. That's good news. Alright, go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in now. (pause) The lights are coming back on. They're... they're cycling through different colors.

Agent: Perfect. That's exactly what we want to see. It should take about a minute or two for everything to boot back up and reconnect to our network. Just give it a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so now I'm seeing... the blue light is back to solid again. It's not blinking.

Agent: (pause) Hmm, that's not what we want to see. It should be blinking or showing a steady green light if it's connected properly. Can you tell me—is your router separate from the modem, or is it all-in-one?

Customer: It's separate. I have the Frontier modem and then a separate router next to it.

Agent: Okay, got it. Let me have you do the same reset on the router. Go ahead and unplug that as well.

Customer: (unplugging sounds) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Let's wait another thirty seconds, and then we'll plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, counting down... (pause) ...now?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) It's booting back up. Lights are flashing. (pause) Still flashing... and... no, it's still the same. The modem light is still solid blue.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay. I'm going to check something on my end really quickly. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays for about 20 seconds)

Agent: Thanks for waiting. So I'm pulling up your service line here and I'm not seeing any active outages reported in your area, which is interesting. But I do want to check something. Can you tell me what your router model is? It should be on a label on the back or bottom.

Customer: Uh, (pause) it says... ASUS. And then... RT-2400 something. The label's a little faded.

Agent: Okay, that's compatible with our service, so that's not the issue. Let me ask you this—when you look at your modem, besides that blue light, are there any red lights or any warning indicators?

Customer: (pause) No, just the blue light and then some other lights above it that seem normal. There's like, an orange one but I think that's always been there.

Agent: The orange light is fine, that's typically just an activity indicator. (pause) Okay, I'm going to walk you through one more troubleshooting step. I want you to try what we call a "power cycle of the entire system." This time, I want you to unplug both the modem and router, wait thirty seconds, and then plug them both back in—modem first, then router about thirty seconds after.

Customer: Alright, sounds good. Unplugging both now. (unplugging sounds) Both are unplugged.

Agent: (pause) And you're waiting thirty seconds?

Customer: Yep, counting it down... (pause) ...now I'm plugging the modem back in. The lights are cycling through again.

Agent: Good. Let's wait another thirty seconds before we plug in the router.

Customer: (pause) Okay... and now the router's going in. (pause) Alright, everything's booting back up again.

Customer: (pause) I mean, we're waiting...

Agent: Right, take your time. This can take up to a couple of minutes sometimes.

Customer: (longer pause) Okay, so... the modem light is... still solid blue. Nothing's changed. The router lights look normal. They're doing their usual thing. But I still can't get online. I tried opening a browser and nothing's loading.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Let me be honest with you here. The solid blue light on your modem—that typically indicates it's powered on but not making a connection to our network. Since the resets aren't resolving it, it's possible we're looking at either a hardware issue with the modem itself or a problem on the network side that I'm not picking up from my end.

Customer: Oh man, that doesn't sound good. So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, I have a couple of options for you. One, I can schedule a technician to come out and check the line and potentially replace your modem if that's the issue. Or, if you want to try one more thing, you could try connecting a device directly to the modem with an ethernet cable just to completely rule out the router being the problem.

Customer: Um, okay. I can try that. Let me just... (pause) ...I have an ethernet cable here. (pause) I'm plugging my laptop directly into the modem now. Let me see if that helps. (pause, typing sounds) Nope. Still nothing. The browser's not loading any pages.

Agent: Okay, so it's definitely the modem or the network. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to take a look at this for you. Can I schedule something?

Customer: Yeah, I guess so. How long would that take? I really need to get this resolved soon.

Agent: I understand completely. Let me check availability. (typing sounds) How does tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM look for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would work. That's better than waiting longer.

Agent: Perfect. I'm scheduling a technician visit for tomorrow morning, between 8 and 12 PM. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes, and we'll also send a reminder the day of. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it quickly tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience today. Our technician will get you sorted out. If you have any other questions before tomorrow, feel free to give us a call back. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for trying to help.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Alright, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
