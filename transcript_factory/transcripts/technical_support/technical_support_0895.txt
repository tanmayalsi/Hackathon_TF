Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Portland area. So your internet has been completely down since this morning?

Customer: Yeah, completely. The modem's on, the lights are... well, actually, I'm not really sure what the lights are supposed to look like. But nothing's working. I can't get online at all.

Agent: Alright, no problem. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you look at your modem for me? It should be a white box, probably either on a shelf or mounted near your router.

Customer: Yeah, I can see it. It's right here next to the router.

Agent: Perfect. What lights do you see on the front of the modem? Are they lit up, or are they off?

Customer: Um... there's a couple of them. There's one that's green, and then there's like a red one and... I think another one that's not lit up? It's kind of hard to tell in this light.

Agent: Okay, which light is red? Is it on the left side, right side...?

Customer: It's in the middle somewhere. The red light is... yeah, it's definitely red.

Agent: That red light typically indicates a connection issue. Let me ask you this—when was the last time your internet was working properly?

Customer: It was fine last night. I was using it around 10 PM, everything was normal. Then I woke up this morning and it just wasn't working.

Agent: Got it. And you haven't had any power outages or anything like that overnight?

Customer: No, everything else seems fine. The lights are on, the TV's working...

Agent: Okay, good. Let's try a restart of the modem. Can you unplug the power cable from the back of the modem for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm doing that now.

Agent: Great. Let's wait about 30 seconds before we plug it back in. This helps clear the modem's memory and often resolves connection issues.

Customer: (background noise) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. While we're waiting, can you tell me if you've noticed any unusual activity with your service recently? Any issues over the past few days?

Customer: No, not really. It's been working great up until this morning. That's what's weird about it.

Agent: (pause) Okay, 30 seconds should be up. Go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay... plugging it in now.

Agent: Good. It'll take a minute or two to boot back up. While we wait for that, can you tell me if there have been any recent storms in your area? Sometimes lightning can affect the connection.

Customer: We did have some pretty bad weather last night, actually. Like around midnight or so. I didn't think about that.

Agent: That could definitely be a factor. (pause) Alright, go ahead and check those lights again. Are they the same as before?

Customer: Let me see... the red light is still there. It's still red.

Agent: Still red, okay. (typing sounds) Um, that's not typical after a restart. Let me check something on my end. (pause) I'm showing that your modem is online and communicating with our network, so the red light is a bit confusing. Can you try connecting to your WiFi? Do you have a phone or laptop nearby?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my phone. (pause) I'm looking for the WiFi network... I don't see ours. I don't see the Frontier network showing up at all.

Agent: Alright, so the WiFi's not broadcasting. That's actually helpful information. That suggests the issue might be with the router itself. Do you have a separate router, or is that all-in-one with your modem?

Customer: Um... I think it's separate. There's two boxes.

Agent: Okay, so you have a separate router. Can you check the lights on that as well? Are any of them lit up?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, um... it's got some lights but they're all... I think they're all either off or very dim. Is that normal?

Agent: No, that's not normal. The router should have at least some lights on. Let me have you restart that too. Go ahead and unplug the router for me.

Customer: Okay... (pause) unplugging now.

Agent: Thank you. Let's wait 30 seconds again.

Customer: (pause) [inaudible] ... how much longer do you think this'll take? I've got to get online for work pretty soon.

Agent: I understand. We're almost there. This is usually one of the first things that fixes it. (pause) Alright, that should be about 30 seconds. Go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) It's back in.

Agent: Great. Let's give it about a minute to boot up and then try the WiFi again.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) So, um, do you think this is going to work?

Agent: Let's see what happens when it boots up. Sometimes a restart of both devices clears everything out. Can you check the WiFi again now?

Customer: (pause) No... still nothing. The router lights are still pretty dim, almost like... well, they're barely on.

Agent: That's concerning. It sounds like the router might not be receiving power properly, or there could be an issue with the device itself. Let me ask—is the power cable securely plugged into the back of the router?

Customer: (pause) Let me check... Yeah, it's plugged in. It feels pretty tight.

Agent: Okay. And the other end of the cable is plugged into a wall outlet?

Customer: Yeah, directly into the wall.

Agent: Let me try something else here. (typing sounds) I'm going to reset the modem from my end and send it a new configuration. This might take a couple of minutes. Can you just stay on the line?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, sure. No problem.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm initiating that now. (longer pause) It should be pushing through the network right now. Can you check those lights again?

Customer: (pause) Um... they're still the same. Red light, the green light... nothing's really changing.

Agent: Still red, okay. (pause, typing sounds) I'm looking at the diagnostics on your modem and... (pause) yeah, I'm seeing that it's connected to the network, but it's showing some odd readings on the line itself. Let me pull up what we have on file for your account. (pause) I'm not seeing any recent maintenance or outages in your area, so that's good.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is something wrong with the line?

Agent: That's what I'm trying to figure out. The fact that the modem is connected but you're not getting internet, and your router isn't getting power or isn't responding correctly, suggests there could be an issue with the equipment or possibly with the connection coming into your home. How long have you had this modem and router?

Customer: Uh... the modem's maybe a year old? The router's... I'm not sure. A couple years, maybe?

Agent: Alright. It's possible the router is failing. That would explain why the lights aren't coming on properly. But I want to rule out the modem first. (pause) I'm going to have you try something. Can you try an ethernet cable? Do you have one nearby?

Customer: An ethernet cable? Um... (pause) I might have one somewhere. Let me look. (longer pause with background rummaging) I think I found one. It's been in a drawer for a while.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug one end directly into the ethernet port on the modem—that should be one of the ports on the back—and then plug the other end into your laptop or computer if you have one.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm connecting it now. (pause) Okay, it's plugged in.

Agent: Great. Now try opening a web browser. See if you can access the internet.

Customer: (pause) Loading... (longer pause) No, it's not working. It's just... it says unable to connect.

Agent: (pause) Alright. That tells me the issue is definitely on the modem or the line side of things, not the router. Let me check the modem status one more time on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm still showing it as connected to the network, but... (pause) you know what, I'm seeing some intermittent signals here that are concerning. I think we might need to have a technician come out and check the line coming into your home and test the equipment directly.

Customer: A technician? How long would that take? I really need internet today.

Agent: I completely understand. (pause) Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) Our earliest appointment would be tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? Yeah, I guess I can make that work. But I really need this fixed today if possible.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, given what I'm seeing here, I think this needs hands-on diagnostics. It could be a line issue that requires specialized equipment to identify. A technician will be able to determine that. Can I get a callback number to confirm that appointment with you?

Customer: The callback number is 555-0147, same as my account number.

Agent: Perfect. I'm scheduling that for you tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM window. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. The technician will be able to identify whether this is an equipment issue or a line issue and get you back online. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just... I'm frustrated this happened. I hope it gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I totally understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Our technician will take great care of you tomorrow. We really appreciate your patience, and thank you for being a Frontier customer.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye.
