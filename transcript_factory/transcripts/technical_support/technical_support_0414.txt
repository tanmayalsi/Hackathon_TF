# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just stopped working about an hour ago and I don't know what's going on. I really need it back up and running.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get this sorted out. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Riverside area. Okay, so when you say your internet stopped working, are you getting any lights on your router or modem?

Customer: Um, let me look... The modem has a red light on it. It's just solid red.

Agent: Okay, a solid red light typically means there's no connection coming from our line. Before we go further, have there been any storms in your area recently? Or any work being done on the lines?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of, no. It's been pretty clear weather all day.

Agent: Alright, let's try the most basic troubleshooting first. I'd like you to unplug both your modem and router, and we'll wait about 30 seconds. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Yeah, give me one second... (pause) Okay, they're both unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait... (pause) ...alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first. That's the device that connects to the wall outlet and the cable line.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. I'm seeing some lights flickering now.

Agent: Good, that's normal. It'll take about a minute or two to boot back up. While we're waiting, let me just ask—have you had any recent power outages or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. This is just really random.

Agent: (pause) Okay, and is the modem showing any lights now? What color?

Customer: Um... it's still showing red. Like, maybe a slightly different shade, but it's red.

Agent: Still red, okay. Give it another 30 seconds or so. Sometimes these take a little bit longer. (pause) While that's happening, can you tell me—are all the cables connected properly? Like, is there a cable going into the wall outlet, and one going into your router?

Customer: Yeah, everything looks connected to me. The cables are all... they're definitely plugged in.

Agent: Okay, good. (pause) Alright, what are you seeing now on the modem?

Customer: Still red. I don't think it's coming back.

Agent: Hmm, that's unusual. Let me try something else. Let's also reboot your router. Go ahead and unplug that for me as well.

Customer: Alright, it's unplugged. (pause) Now what?

Agent: Wait about 15 seconds and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged back in.

Agent: Great. Now on your router, you should see some lights. Can you tell me what those are showing?

Customer: The router's got... one light that's amber colored, and it's blinking. The others are off.

Agent: One amber blinking light—that's actually a good sign. That usually means it's trying to connect. And on the modem, what's it showing now?

Customer: (pause) Still red. Yeah, it's definitely still red.

Agent: Okay, so the issue is happening at the modem level. That red light is telling us that the modem isn't receiving a signal from our network. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm checking for any service outages in your area... and I'm not seeing anything reported.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could mean a few things. Either there's an issue with the line coming to your house, there's an issue with the modem itself, or potentially there's a node issue we haven't been alerted to yet. Let me try a couple more things. Have you noticed any physical damage to the cable line coming into your home? Like, is it loose or anything?

Customer: I mean, I don't really know what to look for, to be honest. I could go check if you want.

Agent: That would be really helpful, actually. Can you take a quick look?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm going to head outside... (background noise of door opening) (pause) Alright, so I see the line coming from the pole. It looks... normal, I guess? I don't see anything weird.

Agent: Okay, and it's connected pretty firmly to the side of your house where it enters?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, it seems tight.

Agent: Alright, good. Go ahead and come back inside. (pause) (background noise of door closing) Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I've done the basic troubleshooting—the reboot, checking the cables. The modem is still showing no connection. This is likely either a modem hardware issue or there's something happening on the line side that we need to investigate further.

Customer: So... can you fix it?

Agent: Well, I have a couple options. We can schedule a technician to come out. They can check the line from the pole and also test the modem to see if it needs to be replaced. That would be the most thorough approach.

Customer: How long would that take? I'm working from home tomorrow.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability... Unfortunately, our next available appointment is tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Does that work with your schedule?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... can't you do anything today?

Agent: I wish I could, but our service calls have already been dispatched for today. Tomorrow is the earliest we can get someone out.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, fine. What about trying a different modem or something? Do you have a workaround?

Agent: Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to send a replacement modem immediately, and we can't ship one out and have it arrive by tonight. The technician tomorrow would be your best bet—they can either repair it on the spot or bring a replacement.

Customer: Alright, let me just... let me try one more time to see if I can get anything working. The modem's been unplugged for a few minutes now. Let me try powering it back up completely from scratch.

Agent: Sure, go ahead. That's worth a shot.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) Waiting... (pause) Alright, plugging back in. (pause) Come on, come on... (pause) Nope. Red light again. Nothing changed.

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately I think at this point we're looking at either a hardware failure or a line issue that needs to be physically checked. I really think the technician visit tomorrow is going to be the way to go.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Okay, fine. Let me schedule the appointment.

Agent: Great. Let me get that set up for you. Can I get a phone number where we can reach you tomorrow?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0892.

Agent: Perfect. So we have you down for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM window, at your address on file. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive. They'll either repair the modem, replace it, or check the line if needed. Does that all sound good?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that sounds good. I just... I really hope they can fix it quickly. I have meetings starting at 8 AM.

Agent: I completely understand. Hopefully the tech can get you back up and running right away. Is there anything else I can help you with this evening?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for being patient with me while we worked through this. We really appreciate your business with Frontier, and we'll get you back online tomorrow. Have a good night.

Customer: Thanks. You too.

Agent: Take care!
