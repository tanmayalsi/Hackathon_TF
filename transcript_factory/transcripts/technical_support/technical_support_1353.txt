# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got a work call in like twenty minutes and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. We'll do our best to get you back online. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... (pause) ...5551-4738. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm finding you now. Okay, I've got your account here. And you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I'd say around seven, seven-thirty? I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing was loading. I just figured maybe the router needed to be reset or something.

Agent: Okay, that makes sense. Have you tried restarting the router yet?

Customer: Yeah, I did that like an hour ago. I unplugged it for like a minute, plugged it back in, but still nothing. The lights aren't even coming on like they normally do.

Agent: Alright, let me ask you a few questions. When you look at the router—and it's the Frontier-branded one, correct?

Customer: Yeah, it's the white box. I think you guys installed it like... two years ago?

Agent: Okay, great. So when you power it back on, what lights do you see? Or do you see no lights at all?

Customer: No, nothing. It's completely dark. Like, I know the power cord is plugged in because I can feel it's connected, but there's no lights, no nothing.

Agent: Got it. So the power indicator isn't lighting up at all. Let me check if there's been any service alerts in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported in your neighborhood. But let me have you do one more thing for me. Can you actually unplug the power cord from the back of the router and wait about thirty seconds?

Customer: Sure, yeah, one second. (pause) (sound of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to hold it unplugged for about thirty seconds. While we're waiting, let me ask—do you happen to have any other devices that might be connected to the router? Like a modem?

Customer: Um, I think so? There's another box next to the router. It's kind of gray-looking. Is that a modem?

Agent: Probably, yeah. The modem should be a separate device. That's actually important because sometimes if the modem loses power too, we need to restart that as well. So when I have you plug things back in, we're gonna do the modem first, wait for it to fully boot up, and then the router. Sound good?

Customer: Okay, yeah, that sounds... let me just... (pause) ...thirty seconds is up, right?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay, it's in.

Agent: Now let's wait about forty-five seconds for it to boot up and see if we get some lights. This typically takes a minute or so.

Customer: (pause) Alright, waiting...

Agent: While that's happening, I do want to check something else. You mentioned you restarted it earlier. Before this morning, was everything working fine yesterday?

Customer: Yeah, yesterday was totally fine. I was working from home and everything was normal. It wasn't until I woke up this morning that it was just... gone.

Agent: Okay, and you haven't had any storms or power outages in your area last night?

Customer: Uh... actually, yeah, now that you mention it. There was like a pretty big thunderstorm around like five in the morning. I remember hearing it, but I thought it had passed.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. Power surges from storms can definitely do a number on these devices. Have you got any lights yet?

Customer: (pause) Nope, still nothing. It's still dark.

Agent: Alright, let's try something else. I want you to unplug the modem as well. You should see two cables going into the back of it—one power cable and one that looks like a phone cord or an internet cable.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I unplugged it.

Agent: Good. While that's unplugged, I'm gonna check if there might be a surge protector involved here. Are both devices plugged directly into the wall outlet, or are they on a power strip?

Customer: They're on one of those... what do you call it? A surge protector power strip. Yeah.

Agent: Okay, so here's what I want you to try. Unplug that surge protector entirely. Leave everything disconnected for about a minute. This will help reset the whole chain.

Customer: Got it. Everything's unplugged now.

Agent: Perfect. Now during this minute, I just want to confirm a couple things. Have you noticed any burning smells or anything that looked visibly damaged on the equipment when you were looking at it?

Customer: No, nothing like that. They just... don't have any power to them, as far as I can tell.

Agent: Alright, that's good. The surge protector likely did its job and protected the equipment from the surge. But it might need to be reset as well. Okay, go ahead and plug the surge protector back in now.

Customer: (sound of plugging) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Now let's plug the modem in first. Give that about a minute to fully boot up. You should see some lights appear.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) Um, still nothing. It's still completely dark.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me check something on the backend here. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm actually showing that we may have a potential equipment failure here. Let me ask you—is there any model number or identification information on the modem? It should be on a sticker usually on the bottom or back.

Customer: (sound of moving equipment) Yeah, I see... uh... it says "MB7621" I think? Is that it?

Agent: Okay, yeah, that's a modem model number. So here's what I'm thinking. The surge protector did what it's supposed to do, but it appears the modem may have sustained some damage. The fact that it's not powering on at all, even after a full reset, is pretty telling.

Customer: Oh no, really? So like... what does that mean? Can you send someone out to replace it?

Agent: Well, normally yes, we would absolutely dispatch a technician. The challenge is that with our current schedule, the earliest I could get someone out there would be... (typing sounds) ...Wednesday afternoon. Would that work for you?

Customer: Wednesday? That's like four days away. I need internet before then. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. That's frustrating. Let me see what I can do. (pause) I'm going to check if we have any same-day or next-day appointments available, but I do want to be honest with you that our technicians are pretty booked. Can you tell me your availability for tomorrow?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I'm flexible tomorrow. Anytime pretty much works.

Agent: Let me check. (typing sounds) (pause) It looks like we have a morning slot available between eight and ten AM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, actually, that would be perfect. That's better than Wednesday.

Agent: Excellent. So I can get a technician scheduled for tomorrow morning between eight and ten. They'll bring a replacement modem and get everything back up and running for you. Before I get you scheduled though, let me just try one more thing. Let me have you unplug the modem and just... leave it unplugged for a couple minutes. Sometimes these devices just need a hard reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugged. How long should I wait?

Agent: About two, three minutes. Just to be thorough.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been a couple minutes. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead.

Customer: (sound of plugging) Plugged back in. (pause) Nope, still nothing. It's not coming on.

Agent: Yeah, I was afraid of that. I think that surge pretty much fried it. Let me get you scheduled for that technician tomorrow. I just need to confirm your address real quick. What's your street address?

Customer: It's 847 Maple Drive, apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And just to confirm, you're available tomorrow morning between eight and ten AM?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Great. I've got your appointment scheduled for tomorrow. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes. The technician will bring a replacement modem, and they'll also check the router to make sure that didn't take any damage either.

Customer: Okay, thank you. So I just... I just won't have internet until tomorrow morning then?

Agent: That's correct, unfortunately. But we'll definitely get you back online tomorrow. I'm putting a notation on your account that this was due to storm damage, so there won't be any service interruption fees or anything like that.

Customer: Oh, that's good at least. Uh, what about my work call in twenty minutes? Is there any way...

Agent: Unfortunately, with the modem being down, I don't have any other options I can offer you. You might want to see if you can reschedule that call or maybe use your phone's hotspot if that's an option?

Customer: Yeah, I guess I could do that. Alright, well, thank you for trying. I appreciate you getting someone out here tomorrow.

Agent: Of course. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today, but at least we have a plan in place. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright. Well, thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow morning. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
