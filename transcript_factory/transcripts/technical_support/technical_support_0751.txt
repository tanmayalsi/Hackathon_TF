# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I grab your account information first? What's the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... and I'm seeing your account under the name... is this Mark Peterson?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Mark. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you had any recent storms in your area, or has anything else happened that you're aware of?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine. I woke up this morning and just... nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Okay. And what device are you trying to connect from right now? Are you on the phone with me from your home?

Customer: I'm calling from my cell phone, yeah. But I can see my router from where I'm sitting and... I mean, the lights aren't even on. That's the problem, right? The router's completely dark.

Agent: Ah, okay. That's actually really helpful information. So the router has no lights on at all. Let me ask—is it plugged in? I know it might sound silly, but we do get this one sometimes.

Customer: (brief pause) Yeah, it's plugged in. I checked that already. The outlet has other stuff plugged into it that's working fine, so... I don't think it's that.

Agent: Good thinking. Alright, what I'd like you to do is—can you locate the power cord on your router and unplug it for me?

Customer: Sure, hold on. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: And now I want you to wait about thirty seconds. Just give it a half minute with no power.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm waiting. (longer pause) ...Still waiting.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug it back in when you're ready.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. So what we're doing is doing what's called a hard reset. Sometimes the router just needs to restart and clear out its memory. Give it about a minute or so and those lights should start coming back on.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) ...Hmm. Nope. Still nothing. Not a single light.

Agent: Still nothing? Okay. (pause) Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) Mark, when was the last time you had any service issues with your account?

Customer: Not that I can remember. I've had this service for like... three years? It's been pretty solid.

Agent: Good, good. And your modem—we're talking about the router, but do you have a separate modem as well?

Customer: Oh. Um... (pause) I'm not sure? I have this one box that has the Wi-Fi symbol on it. Is that...?

Agent: That's probably your combo unit. So you've got one device that does both. That's fine. Is that the one with no lights that you unplugged?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Okay. So here's what I want to try next. Can you check the power cable itself? Like, follow the cord from the outlet to the device. Do you see any damage—any bends, cuts, anything like that?

Customer: (pause, rustling sounds) No, it looks fine. Looks pretty normal to me. The cord feels... I don't know, normal.

Agent: Alright. And the connection on both ends is tight? Both where it plugs into the wall and where it connects to the modem?

Customer: Yeah, both ends are tight. I just checked them.

Agent: Okay, let me look into your account a little deeper here. (typing, pause) Hmm. I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, which is good news.

Customer: So it's not a service outage?

Agent: Doesn't look like it from my end. Usually we see that flagged in the system right away. It sounds more like a hardware issue with your modem.

Customer: So what, the modem just died?

Agent: It's a possibility. They do fail sometimes, especially after a few years. Do you remember—did you notice anything unusual before it went down? Any weird noises, or did it get unusually hot?

Customer: (pause) No, nothing like that. It was just... normal. And then this morning, it was off.

Agent: I'm wondering if maybe there was a power surge overnight that got it. Did you have any kind of flicker in your lights or anything?

Customer: Not that I noticed, no.

Agent: Alright. Let me try one more thing. Go ahead and check your outlet again. Can you try plugging the modem into a different outlet? Maybe somewhere nearby?

Customer: (pause, rustling) Okay, unplugging it... (pause) Walking it over to... yeah, I'm plugging it into the living room outlet now.

Agent: Great. And...?

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. Still completely dark.

Agent: (sigh) Yeah, that tells me the modem itself isn't responding to power, which unfortunately means it's likely a hardware failure.

Customer: So I need a new one?

Agent: (pause) It's looking that way, yeah. I wish I had better news. What I can do is get a replacement unit shipped out to you today. It should arrive within 3 to 5 business days.

Customer: 3 to 5 days? I need internet before that. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand, Mark. That's frustrating. (pause) Let me see what options we have. One thing we could do is see if you have a local Frontier store or... actually, let me check if we can do expedited shipping. (typing) What's your zip code?

Customer: It's 92104.

Agent: (typing) Okay, so actually we do have expedited shipping available for that area. I can get a modem to you by tomorrow or the day after, but that would be an expedited shipping fee of $25.

Customer: (pause) Can't you just... I don't know, not charge me that? I've been a customer for three years.

Agent: I really wish I could waive that for you, Mark. Unfortunately, expedited shipping is a separate charge that's handled by our logistics department. But let me talk to my supervisor real quick and see if there's anything we can do on our end for you as a loyal customer. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: (reluctant) ...Yeah, okay. I can hold.

Agent: Perfect, I'm going to put you on a brief hold.

(hold music, pause)

Agent: (returning) Mark? I'm back. So I spoke with my supervisor, and the best I can do is waive the shipping cost entirely and get you the expedited delivery at no charge. You'd get it by tomorrow evening.

Customer: Oh. Well, that's... that's something, I guess. Yeah, okay. Let's do that.

Agent: Excellent. So I'm going to process a replacement modem with expedited shipping, no charge. You should receive a tracking number via email within the next couple hours. Can I confirm your email is still mark.peterson@...?

Customer: It's mark.peterson@gmail.com.

Agent: (typing) Perfect. I've got that all set up for you. Is there anything else I can help troubleshoot in the meantime, or do you have any other questions about the replacement?

Customer: Uh, no. I guess I'm just... I'll wait for the modem to get here. How do I set it up when it arrives?

Agent: So when it arrives, the setup is pretty straightforward. There are instructions in the box, but basically you'll just unbox it, plug it in, and let it boot up. It should take about five minutes or so. After that, you should see your Wi-Fi network pop up on your devices, and you can reconnect. If you have any issues during the setup, just give us a call back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Okay, that sounds... yeah. I can do that.

Agent: Great. I really do apologize that we couldn't get your current modem back up and running. Hopefully this replacement will get you back online quickly.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. I appreciate that.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mark?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for choosing Frontier, and I'm sorry again for the inconvenience. We'll get you that modem out ASAP.

Customer: Thanks. Appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day, Mark.

Customer: You too.
