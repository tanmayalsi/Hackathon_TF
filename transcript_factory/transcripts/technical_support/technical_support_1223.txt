Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've tried everything I can think of.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I'd be happy to help you get back connected. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I'm showing an account for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Robert. Let me just pull up your service details. (pause) Alright, I've got your account here. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage right now?

Customer: Yeah, complete. Like, the modem is on, the lights are on, but nothing's actually working. I can't even get a browser to load.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me ask you a few questions. First, are you seeing any red or amber lights on your modem, or are they all normal colors?

Customer: Um, let me look here... (pause) No, they're all... they're all green and blue. Everything looks normal from what I can tell.

Agent: Good, good. And when you say the modem is on, I'm assuming you're looking at it right now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm standing right in front of it.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, what I'd like you to do is unplug the power cable from the back of the modem and then count to about ten before plugging it back in. Just a standard reset.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Ten, nine, eight... (pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Now while that boots back up, let me check if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any reported outages in your zip code, which is good. That modem should take about two to three minutes to fully restart.

Customer: Okay, so... (pause) ...I'm just waiting here?

Agent: Yeah, just give it a minute or two. While we wait, can you tell me—have you noticed anything unusual before the internet went out? Any storms in your area, power flickers, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just... I was working from home and suddenly I couldn't load anything. It was just instant.

Agent: Hmm, interesting. Okay, let's see... (pause) Is the modem back up and running now? Are all those lights still showing green and blue?

Customer: Yeah, all the lights are back... wait, let me check if I have internet. (pause) No, still nothing. I'm still getting nothing.

Agent: Alright, still no connection. Let me try a different approach. Can you tell me what kind of router you're using? Is it provided by Frontier, or do you have your own?

Customer: It's... I think it's my own. It's a TP-Link. I got it a couple years ago.

Agent: Okay, got it. So do you have a separate modem and router, or is it an all-in-one unit?

Customer: No, they're separate. The modem is the Frontier box and then I have my own router.

Agent: Perfect, that's helpful. Alright, I want to also restart your router. Same process—unplug it for about ten seconds and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Unplugging now... (pause) Okay, ten seconds... plugging back in.

Agent: Great. While that's restarting, let me check on your connection from our end. (typing sounds) Hmm, that's interesting. I'm seeing that your modem isn't registering an online connection status on our network.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: It means the modem itself isn't connecting to our network. That could indicate an issue with either the modem or the line coming into your house. Let me ask—have you experienced any issues like this before?

Customer: No, not really. I mean, maybe once or twice, but not recently.

Agent: Okay. And you're sure the coaxial cable is secure? The cable coming from your wall into the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean, I can check right now. (pause) It looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Could you just... I know it might seem silly, but could you unscrew it and screw it back on? Just to make sure it's really secure? Sometimes these can loosen over time.

Customer: Sure, yeah. (pause) Okay, I'm unscrewing it... (pause) It does feel a little loose, actually. Let me tighten it up. (pause) Okay, there we go.

Agent: Excellent. Now, do you mind waiting just one more minute to see if that helps?

Customer: (pause) Okay... still nothing. Still no internet.

Agent: Still nothing? Alright. Robert, I'm going to be honest with you—the fact that the modem isn't showing as registered on our network and a cable reseat didn't help suggests we might be looking at a physical issue with either the modem or the line itself. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: It's hard to say without seeing it in person. It could be the modem, or it could be the line coming to your house is compromised somehow. Honestly, at this point, I think we need to get a technician out to your location to do a more thorough evaluation.

Customer: How long would that take?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. What does your schedule look like? I'm seeing we have a few options. We have an appointment available tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or the day after that in the morning slot, 8 AM to 12 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow works better. Let me do tomorrow afternoon.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule that for you. That's tomorrow, uh... (pause) tomorrow the 14th, between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive. The confirmation number is... (typing sounds) ...it's 784829.

Customer: Okay, I got that. So there's nothing else we can try right now?

Agent: Unfortunately, I think we've exhausted the basic troubleshooting. Without a technician being able to physically assess the modem and the line, anything else would just be us going in circles. The good news is our technicians are usually pretty quick at identifying the issue once they're there.

Customer: Alright, I guess that's the best we can do then.

Agent: I really do apologize that we couldn't get you back online today. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up this call?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... I really need this working tomorrow because I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll get the technician out there, and they'll make sure to get you back up and running as quickly as possible. Your confirmation number again is 784829, and you should get a call from them tomorrow between... well, sometime before 5 PM with their ETA.

Customer: Got it. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, Robert. Thanks for choosing Frontier Communications, and sorry again for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
