Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'm gonna do my best to help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And can I get a name please?

Customer: It's David. David Hernandez.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So when you say the internet's been down all morning, what exactly are you experiencing? Is the router powered on?

Customer: Yeah, the router's on. I can see the lights. There's like... there's a red light on it though, and it's just blinking. And I've tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, like, three times already.

Agent: Okay, that red blinking light typically indicates a connection issue. Let me try a few things here. First, can you tell me what color lights you're seeing? Like, are they all red, or is it just one?

Customer: Uh... (pause) it looks like there's one red one on the left side, and then the other lights are kind of... I don't know, they're not really lit up at all. They're kind of dim or off.

Agent: Alright. And do you see the Frontier logo on the router?

Customer: Yeah, it's right here. It's the white box.

Agent: Good. So what I'd like you to do is— can you locate the power cable on the back of the router?

Customer: Yeah, I see it.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to have you unplug it, and then we're gonna wait about thirty seconds before we plug it back in. This is called a hard reset, and it often resolves connection issues. Go ahead and unplug it for me.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now while we wait, let me ask you a couple quick questions. Have you had any recent storms in your area, or any service work done on your line recently?

Customer: No storms that I know of. Um, actually, now that you mention it, there were some Frontier trucks in my neighborhood a few days ago. They were doing something with the lines out front.

Agent: Okay, that could be relevant. Sometimes after maintenance work, there can be connection issues. Alright, it's been about thirty seconds now. Go ahead and plug the router back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in now... (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about a minute to boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me— do you have any devices connected to the router right now? Like a computer or anything?

Customer: I've got my laptop sitting right here. It's showing that the Wi-Fi is available but it's not connecting. It just keeps saying "can't connect to network."

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let's give it just another moment to fully boot up. Sometimes it takes a full minute or so. Are you seeing any changes in the lights on the router now?

Customer: (pause) Um... the red light is still blinking. The others are still pretty dim. This is... this is not looking good, is it?

Agent: Well, let's not worry just yet. (typing sounds) I'm actually showing on my end that your modem is registering as offline. That red light you're seeing is the indicator for that. Let me check a few things on my system here. (pause) Can you tell me, when the internet stopped working this morning, was it sudden? Like, one minute it was working and the next minute it wasn't?

Customer: Yeah, pretty much. I went to check my email this morning and nothing would load. I assumed maybe it was a browser thing, but then I realized the Wi-Fi icon on my laptop showed it wasn't even connected to the network.

Agent: Right. Okay, so I'm not seeing any alerts in our system about outages in your area, which is good. But I am seeing that your modem went offline sometime last night around 2 AM. Let me try something. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem from my end. This should take just a minute.

Customer: (pause) Okay, sending it now?

Agent: Yes, sending it now. (typing sounds) Okay, it's been sent. Go ahead and keep an eye on that router for me. Let me know if you see any changes in those lights.

Customer: (pause) ...Still the same. Red light blinking, everything else is dark.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Hmm. Okay, let me try a different approach. I'm going to have you do what's called a factory reset on the router. This will erase all the settings, but we'll reconfigure it. Before we do that though, do you know your Wi-Fi password?

Customer: Um... (hesitation) I have it written down somewhere. Let me look... (rustling sounds) Yeah, I found it. It's in my drawer.

Agent: Good, go ahead and write down the current password just in case. Alright, so on the back of the router, there should be a small button. It might be recessed, so you might need a paperclip or a pen to press it.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It says "Reset" on it.

Agent: Perfect. I want you to hold that button down for about ten seconds while the router is powered on. This will restore it to factory settings.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...holding it... (pause) ...how much longer?

Agent: About five more seconds should do it. (pause) Alright, you can release it now.

Customer: I let go. Now what?

Agent: Now let's wait for it to reboot again. This will take a minute or two. While we wait, I should mention that after this reset, you're going to need to reconnect to the network using the Wi-Fi name and password that's on a sticker on the back of the router. The default login will be different from what you had before.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Um, Marcus? The lights are still doing the same thing. It's been like two minutes and nothing's changed.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Alright, let me check something here. (typing sounds, longer pause) I'm not... actually, I'm still not seeing the modem coming online on my end. Even after the factory reset, it's still showing as offline in our system.

Customer: So that means... what does that mean?

Agent: (pause) It could mean a few different things. It might be an issue with the physical connection at the street level, or... (pause) I wish I had better news here, David, but I think this might be something that needs an on-site technician visit. The modem itself may have been damaged, or there could be a line issue from the maintenance work that happened in your neighborhood.

Customer: Oh man... (frustrated) How long would that take?

Agent: Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) I'm looking at our schedule for your area. How does Thursday, between 1 and 5 PM work for you?

Customer: Today's Tuesday, so... (pause) that's two days from now?

Agent: Yes, that would be Thursday. Does that work?

Customer: I mean... it's not ideal, but I guess so. I don't really have a choice, do I?

Agent: I understand your frustration. I really do. Unfortunately, with the complexity of this issue, I can't resolve it remotely. A technician will be able to test the line and either repair it or replace your modem if needed.

Customer: Alright. Yeah, go ahead and schedule it for Thursday.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got a technician scheduled for Thursday between 1 and 5 PM. They'll call you about an hour before they arrive. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone today, but I'm confident the technician will get you back online. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully they can fix it Thursday.

Agent: I'm sure they will. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, David. We appreciate your patience, and we'll see you Thursday.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
