# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Marcus speaking. Can I get your name and account number to get started?

Customer: Yeah, hi. My name is David Chen. Um, it's... hold on, let me find my bill here. Account number is... 4-7-2-9-8-5-1.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, David. I'm pulling up your account now. So what seems to be going on today?

Customer: My internet just stopped working. Like, completely. I was watching something on my laptop, and suddenly everything just... went down. That was about twenty minutes ago.

Agent: Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me—is your modem powered on? Do you see any lights on the front of it?

Customer: Um, yeah. Yeah, there's... (pause) there's a light on. It looks like it's blinking red though. Is that bad?

Agent: A red light typically means there's a connection issue. That's actually a good sign that we can probably fix this. Where is your modem located?

Customer: It's in my living room, on a shelf by the TV.

Agent: Great. Okay, David, what I'd like you to do is unplug the modem from the wall outlet for about thirty seconds. While you're doing that, also unplug your router if you have one.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now... (pause) Yeah, both are unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Let's wait about thirty seconds here. (pause) You still there?

Customer: Yep, I'm here.

Agent: All right, go ahead and plug the modem back in first, and then the router after about ten seconds.

Customer: Okay, plugging modem back in... (pause) and now the router. So... do I just wait?

Agent: Yeah, give them about two minutes to fully boot back up. While we wait, have there been any recent storms in your area? Or any construction work near your home?

Customer: No storms. Although, um... they were doing some work on the telephone poles down the street yesterday. Does that matter?

Agent: It could potentially. They might've disconnected something, or there could be a line issue from that. Let's see if the reboot helped first. What are the lights looking like now on your modem?

Customer: (pause) Um... still red. It's still blinking red.

Agent: Still red, okay. Does the router have any lights on it?

Customer: The router's lights are off. Nothing's lighting up on that.

Agent: All right, that's telling me the modem isn't syncing with our network. Let me ask you this—do you have a coaxial cable connected to the modem? It's a thick cable, kind of looks like what connects to a TV?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's going into the wall there.

Agent: Good. Can you check if it's firmly connected to the modem? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) I'm checking... seems pretty tight to me. I twisted it just to be sure though.

Agent: Excellent. And did anything change on the modem when you twisted it?

Customer: No, still just... red blinking.

Agent: Okay. (typing sounds) Let me check something on my end here. (pause) All right, I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, which is good news. Your equipment is showing as offline though. Can you try one more thing for me? I'm going to have you do a factory reset on the modem.

Customer: A factory reset? Will that like... erase everything?

Agent: No, the modem doesn't store personal data like a computer would. It should be fine. There should be a small reset button on the back of the modem. You'll need to press and hold it for about ten seconds with a paperclip or pen.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. Holding it now... (pause) How long has it been?

Agent: You can let go.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let go. Anything happening?

Agent: It should reboot. This might take a couple minutes. While we wait, did you notice any burning smells or anything unusual before the internet went down?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Just... one second it was fine, and the next, nothing.

Agent: Right. (pause) So what are we seeing now?

Customer: Um... (pause) Still red. Just... keeps blinking red.

Agent: (pause) Okay, David. I'm going to be honest with you—that red light typically indicates either a signal issue coming from outside or a problem with the modem itself. Given that the reset didn't help and all our troubleshooting steps haven't resolved it, I think we might be looking at either a line problem or a modem failure.

Customer: So what does that mean? How do I fix it?

Agent: Well, there are a couple of options. The first would be to send a technician out to your location. They can check the line from the pole to your house and make sure everything's connected properly on our end. They could also test the modem to see if it's functioning correctly.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back.

Agent: I have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could do the afternoon slot from 1 to 5 PM. The next day after that would be Thursday morning.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. Can you do that?

Agent: Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) I'm going to put you down for tomorrow, Wednesday, between 8 and 12. Is that going to work?

Customer: Yeah, that works. What's the charge for this?

Agent: If it turns out to be a line issue or something on our end, there would be no charge. If it's the modem and it's within warranty, we can replace it. If it's out of warranty, there might be a small fee, but the technician can go over those details with you when they arrive.

Customer: Okay... (sigh) I guess that's the best we can do then.

Agent: I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. The technician will be thorough though. I'm going to text you a confirmation with the appointment details and the technician's phone number. They'll give you a call about thirty minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: You're all set, David. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, anyway.

Agent: No problem at all. We appreciate your patience, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible. Thanks for calling Frontier!

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now!
