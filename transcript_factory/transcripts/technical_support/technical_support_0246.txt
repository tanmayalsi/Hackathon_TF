Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... hold on. (pause) It's 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. So your internet service has been completely down since this morning, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, since like 8 or 9 AM. I didn't notice right away, but then I tried to work from home and nothing was working. The modem's still on, the lights are doing their thing, but I can't connect to anything.

Agent: Alright, let me help you troubleshoot that. First, let's start with the basics. Can you tell me what color the lights are on your modem right now? There should be a few of them.

Customer: Um, okay, so... (pause) there's a green light, and then there's like a white one that's blinking, I think?

Agent: Okay, so we're looking at... is the green light steady or is it blinking?

Customer: It's steady. Green and just sitting there. The white one's the one that's blinking.

Agent: Got it. And what about the other lights? There should be a few more—maybe a blue one or a red one?

Customer: (pause) There's... I'm looking at it now. There's like four lights total. The green one's steady, the white one's blinking, and then there's two others that are just... off, I guess? Not lit up.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful, thank you. So what I'm hearing is that you don't have a solid blue light, which typically indicates internet connectivity. The blinking white light usually means the modem is trying to sync with our network. Have you tried power cycling the modem yet?

Customer: Power cycling? You mean like unplugging it?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Go ahead and unplug the modem from the power source, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. That'll give it a fresh restart.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I can do that. (pause) Let me just... (pause) okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Thirty seconds, right? (pause) Yeah, I'll wait. (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and let that boot back up. It should take about two to three minutes. While we wait, let me ask—have there been any recent storms in your area, or have you noticed any loose cables or anything that looks out of place around your modem or router?

Customer: No storms. It's been clear all week. And, uh, everything looks normal to me. The cables are all plugged in and... yeah, seems fine.

Agent: Okay, good. (pause) And just to confirm, you're not able to connect to Wi-Fi on any of your devices?

Customer: Right, nothing. I've got my laptop, my phone, tried both. No connection.

Agent: Alright. Is the modem booted back up yet? Can you check those lights again?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, so... it's still doing the same thing. Green's steady, white's still blinking, and the others are still off.

Agent: Okay, that's... that's a bit unusual. The white light should stop blinking and we should see a blue light come on once it successfully connects. Let me try something else. Can you unplug the cable that goes from your wall outlet into the modem? It's usually a coaxial cable—it looks like a thick wire with a metal connector on the end.

Customer: The one that comes from the wall?

Agent: Yes, exactly.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see it. I'm unplugging it now. (pause) It's out.

Agent: Good. Now, can you wiggle it a little bit to make sure there's no debris or anything, and then plug it back in firmly? Make sure you hear a little click.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Yeah, I'm doing that. (pause) It's back in. I heard the click.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about another minute or two and see if anything changes with those lights.

Customer: (pause) ...No, same thing. Green and blinking white. That's it.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay, this is starting to sound like it might be a line issue on our end rather than something with your modem. Do you happen to have a second phone or device you can try connecting to the modem's Wi-Fi to just double-check?

Customer: I mean, I already tried my phone, but... I guess I could try my tablet?

Agent: That'd be great, yeah. Just to rule out any device-specific issues.

Customer: (pause) Okay, pulling it out... (pause) Let me see... I'm looking for the Wi-Fi network. (pause) I see it. Entering the password... (pause) Nope. Nothing. It's not connecting.

Agent: Alright, that confirms the issue is with the modem or the line, not your devices. Let me put you on a brief hold here while I check our network status in your area. It's possible we're having some issues on our end.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Thanks for holding. I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area at the moment, which is strange. I do want to try one more thing if you're up for it.

Customer: Yeah, go ahead.

Agent: Can you try doing a factory reset on the modem? I'll walk you through it. On the back of the modem, there should be a small recessed button labeled "Reset."

Customer: A reset button? (pause) Okay, I'm looking... yeah, I see it. It's really small.

Agent: Right. You'll need something like a paperclip or a pen to press it. Hold it down for about ten to fifteen seconds. Fair warning, this is going to erase all your settings, so we'll need to set it back up, but sometimes this can help.

Customer: Alright, I'm doing it. I'm holding it down... (pause) ...okay, I'm counting... (pause) Yeah, ten, fifteen seconds. Letting go now.

Agent: Perfect. Now watch the lights. The modem should go completely dark and then restart from scratch.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, they're all off now. And... (pause) okay, they're coming back on. (pause) Green light's steady again... white's blinking... (pause) and it's still just those two.

Agent: (long pause) Okay. I have to be honest with you, I think at this point we're looking at either a line issue or a problem with the modem itself that's preventing it from connecting to our network. Given that we've tried the basics and the reset, and there's no outage in your area, I think we should get a technician out to your location to do a proper diagnosis.

Customer: Really? How long is that going to take?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest I can get someone out is... looks like tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon? That's... okay, I guess that'll have to work. I was really hoping to have this fixed today, but... yeah, tomorrow afternoon is fine.

Agent: I completely understand. I apologize that we couldn't resolve this over the phone. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, you're all set. We have a technician visit scheduled for tomorrow between 2 and 5 PM. Is the contact number we have on file still good?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. You'll receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes. In the meantime, just leave the modem plugged in as is. If anything changes or if you want to try reaching back out before the appointment, feel free to call back anytime. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just really hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident they'll get to the bottom of it. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We really appreciate your patience. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
