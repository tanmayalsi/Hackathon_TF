# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I've got work from home stuff I need to do and it's just... it's not working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847. That's the number on the bill.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm looking at your account now. So the internet service is completely down, is that correct? No connection at all?

Customer: Right, yeah. Nothing. I've tried unplugging the router, waiting a bit, plugging it back in... nothing's working. The modem lights aren't even showing up like they usually do.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So the modem lights aren't illuminating at all—that tells me we might be looking at a power issue or a potential service issue on our end. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Is the modem plugged in directly to the wall outlet?

Customer: Yes, I mean... let me look. (pause) Yeah, it's plugged in. The power cable is definitely in the wall outlet.

Agent: Good. And you said you unplugged it and plugged it back in. When you do that, do you see any lights come on at all, even if they're different colors?

Customer: Um... (pause) Okay, so when I first plug it in, I see like... a white light? Or maybe blue? It's hard to tell. But then it just... I don't know, it seems to stop after a few seconds.

Agent: Alright. So we're getting some initial power, which is good. That white or blue light you're seeing—that's typically the startup sequence. The fact that it's stopping suggests the modem might be having trouble connecting to our network. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) 

(pause)

I'm not seeing any service issues in your area, and your line appears to be active. Let me try a few more things with you. Can you look at the modem and tell me what model it is? There should be a label on the back or the bottom.

Customer: (pause) Uh, Frontier... something. (reading) It says "Frontier 5G Advanced Modem." Is that what you're looking for?

Agent: Perfect, thank you. Okay, so here's what I want you to do. I want you to do what's called a factory reset on the modem. You're going to hold down the reset button—it's usually a small button on the back—and hold it for about ten seconds. This will clear everything and start fresh.

Customer: Hold on... (sounds of movement) Okay, I'm looking at the back. There's a little hole... is that it?

Agent: Yes, exactly. That's the reset button. You'll need something small to press it, like a paperclip.

Customer: (sounds of searching) Okay, got one. Here we go... (pause) I'm holding it down.

Agent: How many seconds would you say you've been holding it?

Customer: Um... probably like five or six?

Agent: Go ahead and hold it a couple more seconds... and then let go.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let go. Now what? Should I see something happen?

Agent: Yeah, the lights should start blinking. Give it about 30 to 45 seconds to fully reboot. Just let me know when you see the lights stabilize or when you think it's done starting up.

Customer: (pause, background humming) Okay, so... I'm seeing lights now. There's like a blue light and a white light and they're kind of... flickering?

Agent: That's normal for the startup. Just give it a full minute to stabilize. We can chat while you wait. How long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, probably about two years now? I switched from Century Link because I heard Frontier was better in my area. Usually it works fine, so this is weird.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, it's unusual. We don't see a lot of issues like this. Okay, how are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Um... they're still kind of blinking. Actually, wait—now the blue light stopped and it's just the white one. Is that... good?

Agent: The white light is fine. It means the modem is operational. Now let me ask—do you have a computer or phone nearby that you can check for WiFi networks?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my laptop right here. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the WiFi networks and... I don't see the Frontier network. That's weird. Usually it just... pops up.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Okay, let me try something else. Can you unplug the modem one more time for me, but this time wait about two minutes before plugging it back in?

Customer: Two minutes? That's... that's a long time. Why two minutes?

Agent: Sometimes the line needs to fully refresh with our network. The longer power cycle can help reset the connection.

Customer: (sighing) Alright, I guess. Hold on. (pause, sound of unplugging)

Agent: No problem, I'll be right here.

(pause, background noise)

Customer: Okay, so I'm just... sitting here. Should I stay on the phone?

Agent: Yeah, you can stay on the line. We can just... chat. (pause) How's your day going, other than the internet situation?

Customer: (chuckles) Well, you know, it'd be better if I had internet. I've got a video call with my team at... (sounds of checking time) ...in about 45 minutes, so I really need to get this working.

Agent: I totally understand. We'll get you back online before then. (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in, beeping) Alright, it's in.

Agent: Same as before—let's give it about a minute to fully boot up and connect.

Customer: (pause) Okay... the lights are doing the same thing. Blue and white, flickering.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check the backend here. (pause, longer pause) 

Hmm. I'm going to be honest with you—this is a little unusual. I'm not seeing the modem properly register with our network on this end. That's typically a sign that either the modem has an issue, or there's something on the line side that we need to address.

Customer: What do you mean "on the line side"?

Agent: Could be an issue with the connection coming into your house from our network. Or it could be the modem itself needs to be replaced. I'm leaning toward needing to send a technician out because I'm not comfortable saying it's definitely the modem when I can't fully diagnose it remotely.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) A technician? How long does that usually take?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) When are you available? We have morning and afternoon slots. Earliest I'm seeing is... tomorrow morning between 8 and 12.

Customer: Tomorrow? I need this working today. I have that video call in less than an hour.

Agent: I understand. Unfortunately, our next available slot for same-day service is... (pause) ...we're not showing anything available today, I'm sorry. But I can absolutely get you scheduled for tomorrow morning, first thing. And I can make a note that this is a priority.

Customer: (pause) Yeah... okay. I don't really have a choice, do I?

Agent: I wish I had another option for you right now. But the good news is, worst-case scenario it's just the modem and we'll get you a replacement out here tomorrow. (pause) But before we do that, let me try one more thing real quick. Can you check if your modem has a small battery backup button or a reset sequence on the front?

Customer: I don't see... wait, there's like a little button that says... "WPS"? Is that what you're talking about?

Agent: That's not quite it, but... let me try accessing the modem's admin panel. Do you know the IP address or... actually, you know what, this is getting a bit technical. Given that we haven't been able to get a WiFi network showing up, I think the best move really is to get a tech out there.

Customer: (resigned) Yeah, okay. Tomorrow morning then.

Agent: Let me get that set up for you right now. (typing sounds) So tomorrow, between 8 AM and 12 PM, someone will be out to your location. I'm going to put a priority note on this so they know to get you back online as quickly as possible. We'll probably do a full modem replacement just to be safe.

Customer: And I don't have to do anything tonight?

Agent: Nope, just leave the modem as is. Don't keep powering it on and off—that can sometimes complicate things. Just leave it unplugged and we'll get you all sorted tomorrow morning. You should receive a confirmation text and maybe an email with the appointment details.

Customer: Okay. Well... thank you, I guess. Even though you couldn't fix it today.

Agent: I know it's frustrating, and I really wish I could have resolved this remotely. But you'll definitely be back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. We appreciate your patience, and sorry again for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Take care. Goodbye.
