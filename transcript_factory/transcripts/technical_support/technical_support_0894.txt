# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um... my internet has been out since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And your name?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Okay, I see you're in the Riverside area and you have our Fiber 500 plan. So your internet's completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely. No lights on the modem or anything. Well, actually... there's like a red light, I think? Or orange maybe.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So you're seeing a red or orange light. Can you describe what the modem looks like? Is it the white box?

Customer: Yes, white box. It's got the Frontier logo on it.

Agent: Great. And when you look at it, are there any other lights on it at all, or just that one red or orange light?

Customer: (pause) Just that one. Everything else is dark.

Agent: Alright. What I'd like you to do first is... can you check the back of the modem and make sure all the cables are plugged in securely? Sometimes they can get jostled loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding on... (rustling sounds) Um, the power cord is plugged in... the... I think it's the internet cable or whatever—that's plugged in too. There's like three cables back here.

Agent: That's normal. The three cables would be power, the fiber connection, and then your ethernet if you're using a wired connection. So those all look secure?

Customer: Yeah, they seem fine.

Agent: Good. Now I'm going to have you do a full restart. Can you unplug the power cable from the back of the modem?

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: And let it sit for about thirty seconds. While we wait, can you tell me... have there been any recent storms or anything in your area? Power outages?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Weather's been fine. But now that you mention it, my neighbor's lights are all on, so I don't think there was a power outage.

Agent: Good, that's useful to know. Okay, thirty seconds should be up. Go ahead and plug the power back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (sounds of plugging in) ...I'm plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. And now we're going to wait for it to boot back up. That usually takes about two to three minutes. While that's happening, is there anything else unusual you noticed before the internet went out? Any storms last night? Any changes to your setup?

Customer: (pause) No, not that I can think of. It was working fine last night when I went to bed. This morning I just... it was out. Actually, wait. Yesterday the internet did flicker a couple times in the afternoon. I didn't think much of it.

Agent: Okay, that could be relevant. The flickering can sometimes indicate an issue with the line. (pause) So how are we looking with those lights now? Is anything changed?

Customer: Um... still just the one orange light. Actually, maybe it's more red now?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay. Let me try something on my end. I'm going to send a signal to your modem to see if I can get it to reset or respond. Can you just... keep watching it?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching... (longer pause) ...nothing's happening. The light's still just that one color.

Agent: Alright. And you're not seeing any other lights flickering or turning on or off?

Customer: No. Nothing.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm. Let me check something here. (pause) Okay, David, I'm looking at our network on this end, and I'm not actually seeing your modem online at all. It's possible there's an issue with the fiber connection itself.

Customer: So like... the line is down?

Agent: It could be. Let me ask you—and I know this might sound basic, but—you do have power in the rest of your house, right? Lights, everything?

Customer: (slight laugh) Yeah, power's fine. Everything else works.

Agent: (chuckles) Okay, I had to ask. Let me try one more thing. I'm going to have you look at that fiber cable in the back—it should be a thin, yellow-ish cable, kind of like a thin fiber optic line?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's connected on both ends.

Agent: Okay, great. And does it look... I don't know, damaged or anything? Bent really sharply?

Customer: (pause) No, it looks okay to me. It's a little bent but not like, severely or anything.

Agent: Alright. (pause) David, I've got to be honest with you. Based on what I'm seeing on my end and what you're describing, it sounds like there might be an issue with the line itself between here and your house. The modem isn't coming online at all, which usually means it's a connection problem rather than a device problem.

Customer: So what does that mean? How do we fix it?

Agent: Well, normally what I'd do is escalate this to our field service team. They'd be able to send a technician out to inspect the line and identify where the issue is. Let me just... (typing sounds) ...let me try one more restart just to make absolutely sure. 

Customer: Okay...

Agent: Can you unplug it again?

Customer: (pause, rustling sounds) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: And while it's unplugged, I want you to flip the power switch on the back of the modem, if there is one.

Customer: (pause) There's a button that says power. Should I push that?

Agent: Actually, no, leave that. Just keep it unplugged. Let's wait another minute this time, just to be thorough.

Customer: (pause) Okay, just... waiting.

Agent: And are you... how long has the internet been out now? Since this morning you said?

Customer: Yeah, since like... seven or eight this morning. So about four hours now.

Agent: And you haven't called us yet or reported it or anything?

Customer: No, you're the first person I'm calling. I was hoping it would just come back on.

Agent: I understand. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause, sounds of plugging in) It's in.

Agent: (pause) Let's give it a moment... (longer pause) Any change?

Customer: (pause) No. Same orange light. Nothing else.

Agent: (sigh) Okay. Yeah, I think we're going to need to get a technician out to your place. This is beyond what I can troubleshoot remotely.

Customer: So how long will that take?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... When are you available? Are you home now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm home all day today. Whenever you can get someone, really.

Agent: (pause, typing) Okay. I'm showing that our next available window is... tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM. I know that's not ideal.

Customer: (frustrated) Tomorrow? I really need this fixed today. I have work stuff I need to do online.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see if there's anything... (typing sounds) ...unfortunately, we don't have any same-day appointments available for your area right now. I see there's a note on the system that we had some line issues reported in your neighborhood yesterday, so I suspect that might be related to what you're experiencing.

Customer: So it's a known issue?

Agent: There were a couple reports, yes. But I don't have details on whether they were all related or what the cause was. The technician will be able to determine that when they come out.

Customer: This is really frustrating. I can't believe this.

Agent: I know, and I apologize. I genuinely wish I could get someone out today. If you'd like, I can note on your account that this is urgent and I can put you on a list in case there's a cancellation, and we'd try to get someone out sooner.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Do that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've added that notation. So to confirm, we have you down for tomorrow, 8 AM to 5 PM window, and I've flagged it as a priority in case something opens up. You'll get a call from our dispatch team about an hour before the technician is scheduled to arrive.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Is there anything I should do in the meantime?

Agent: Um... (pause) Not really much you can do, honestly. Just keep the modem plugged in and powered on. Don't mess with any of the cables. And actually, can you do me a favor? Can you just jot down exactly when the internet went out and if you notice the modem does anything different before the technician arrives?

Customer: Sure, I can do that.

Agent: Great. And is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (pause) No, I guess not. Just... thanks for trying, I guess. I wish you could've fixed it.

Agent: I'm sorry I couldn't resolve this today. I know it's inconvenient. I'm going to make sure this is prioritized on our end. Is the best number to reach you at this phone number here?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap—you've got a service appointment tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM, and dispatch will call an hour before. We'll get to the bottom of this.

Customer: Alright. Thank you.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, David. We appreciate your patience, and we'll get you back up and running as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
