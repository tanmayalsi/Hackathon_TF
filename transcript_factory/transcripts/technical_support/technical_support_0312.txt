Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'll definitely help you get this sorted out. Can I grab your account number or phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment here... Alright, I've got you pulled up. I'm showing an account for Michael Chen at 2847 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. When exactly did you first notice it wasn't working?

Customer: Uh, around 8 o'clock? I was trying to work from home and nothing would load. I've restarted my modem like three times already and it's still not coming back up.

Agent: Okay, okay. Let's start from the beginning here. First thing I want to check—when you restart the modem, what lights are you seeing on the front of it?

Customer: Um... (pause) there's like... the power light is solid blue, the internet light is... it's not really lighting up. It just keeps blinking red.

Agent: The internet light is blinking red. Got it. And just to confirm, is the modem plugged in directly to the wall outlet?

Customer: Yeah, it's plugged in. The power cord is fine.

Agent: Perfect. Can you do me a favor and unplug the modem completely? Just pull it out of the wall.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to hold it unplugged for about 30 seconds. This is gonna do a full reset of the device.

Customer: (background noise) Alright, I'm counting... (longer pause) ...thirty seconds. Should I plug it back in now?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) The lights are coming back on. The power light is blue again but... (pause) ...yeah, the internet light is still blinking red.

Agent: Still blinking red? Alright. Do you have a modem and a router, or is it a combo unit?

Customer: I think it's just one unit? It's the one Frontier gave me when we set up the service.

Agent: Right, so it's a combo unit. Okay. Let me check something on your account here. (typing sounds) Hmm. I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, which is a good sign. Let me ask you this—have there been any storms or power outages in your neighborhood recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The power's been fine all day.

Agent: Okay. And you're sure the cable line coming into the modem is firmly connected?

Customer: The cable line? Um... (pause) let me check. I'd have to get behind the TV stand... (background noise of movement) Yeah, it looks pretty connected to me. It's in there tight.

Agent: Alright. Here's what I'm thinking—the blinking red light typically indicates either a signal issue or a problem with the connection to our network. Let me see if I can send a restart signal to your modem remotely. This should only take about a minute.

Customer: Okay, yeah, do whatever you need to do.

Agent: (typing sounds) (longer pause) Alright, I'm sending that now. What you should see is the lights are gonna go dark for a few seconds and then they'll cycle back on.

Customer: (pause) Uh... the lights went dark. Now they're coming back... (pause) ...okay, the power light is back. The internet light is... (pause) ...it's still blinking red.

Agent: Still blinking red. Okay. (pause) Let me try one more thing. I'm going to check to see if there's a signal coming in on our end. (typing sounds) (pause) That's... hmm. Okay, so here's what I'm seeing. We are getting a signal from your modem, but it looks like it's dropping in and out. That suggests there might be an issue either with the line coming into your house or possibly with the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, I have a couple options for you. The first thing would be to check if maybe the line is damaged somewhere outside your house. Do you have easy access to where the line comes in from the street?

Customer: I mean... I could look, but I don't really know what I'm looking for.

Agent: That's alright. Just to check, is there a gray or black box on the outside of your house? Usually it's near the foundation or on the side?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there is. It's on the side of the house.

Agent: Perfect. Can you take a look at that for me? See if there's any visible damage, like cuts or pinches in the cable?

Customer: (background noise of door opening) (pause) I'm looking at it now. It's pretty dirty but... I don't see any damage from what I can tell. The cable looks intact.

Agent: Okay, good. That's good. Unfortunately, from what I'm seeing here, I don't think this is something we can resolve over the phone. The modem is communicating with us, but the signal is unstable. This could be a few different things—it could be a line issue we need to investigate in person, or it could be the modem itself is failing.

Customer: So... what do I do? I need my internet working. I've got a conference call at 2 o'clock.

Agent: I completely understand, and I wish I had better news. What I'd like to do is get a technician out to your location. Let me check availability for you. (pause, typing sounds) (longer pause) Okay, so we have an opening... it looks like we could get someone out there tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Or if you need something sooner, we do have an after-hours appointment available today at 6 PM, but there would be an additional charge for that.

Customer: (frustrated) After-hours? I can't wait until tomorrow. My work is being affected by this. Can't someone come out sooner today?

Agent: I understand how frustrating this is. Let me see what I can do. (pause, typing sounds) (longer pause) Unfortunately, all daytime slots are booked through about 3 PM today. The next available regular appointment is what I showed you—tomorrow morning through early afternoon, or today at 6 PM with the after-hours fee.

Customer: What's the after-hours fee?

Agent: That would be an additional $75 on top of the service call.

Customer: (pause) That's... that seems like a lot. What if I just do tomorrow?

Agent: That's certainly an option. I can get you scheduled for tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. The technician will come to diagnose the issue. If it's something simple, it might be a quick fix. If it's the modem, we can replace that for you.

Customer: Will there be a charge for that?

Agent: The service call itself is covered under your plan, so there's no trip charge. If we need to replace the modem, that would be a one-time replacement fee of $99, or you could rent one for a monthly fee. But let's see what the technician finds first.

Customer: (pause) Yeah... okay. Tomorrow works I guess. But I really need this fixed.

Agent: I totally understand. Let me get you all set up. I'm gonna need to confirm a few details. You're at 2847 Maple Street, is that correct?

Customer: Yes.

Agent: And your phone number?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. So I have you scheduled for a technician visit tomorrow, July 15th, between 12 PM and 4 PM. A technician will come to your home to diagnose the issue with your modem and internet connection. You should receive a confirmation email and a text message within the next few minutes with all the details.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything I should do in the meantime?

Agent: Just keep the modem plugged in. Don't restart it anymore—that won't help at this point. The technician will take it from there tomorrow.

Customer: Alright. I guess that's it then.

Agent: I apologize we couldn't get this resolved over the phone for you today, Michael. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for... yeah, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. We appreciate your patience and your business. We'll get you back online as soon as possible. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
