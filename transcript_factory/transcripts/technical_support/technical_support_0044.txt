# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. Thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it fixed because I'm working from home today.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... hold on. (shuffling sounds) It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: Perfect, thank you James. I'm showing your account here. So you've got our Fiber 500 package. When exactly did your internet go down?

Customer: Um, around 7 this morning, I'd say? I went to make some coffee, came back, and everything was just... offline. The router, it's got some lights on it, but nothing's working. I can't get connected.

Agent: Alright, so the router does have power. That's good—that's a start. Let's do a quick troubleshoot here. Can you tell me which lights you're seeing on the router right now? Is there a power light that's solid, blinking...?

Customer: Yeah, yeah. There's a green light that's on. And then there's like a... I think it's yellow? It's blinking.

Agent: Okay, the green light is good. That yellow blinking light—that usually indicates the router is trying to sync with the network. Um, let me just check our system here for any outages in your area. (brief pause, typing sounds) No, I'm not seeing any active outages on our end. So let's try a couple things. First, can you do me a favor and locate the power cable on the back of your router?

Customer: Uh, yeah. I can see it. It's plugged into the outlet.

Agent: Great. I need you to unplug it for me and then wait about 30 seconds. While we're doing that, I'll explain what's happening. Sometimes the router just needs to reset and renegotiate its connection with our network.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (sound of cable disconnecting) Should I count to thirty?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and count it out.

Customer: (counting, barely audible) ...twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now it's gonna take about a minute or two to fully boot up. While we wait, let me just ask—have there been any storms in your area recently? Any chance the line outside might have been damaged?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine. It was just... out of the blue this morning.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Okay, give it another moment here. (typing sounds) Is your router fully powered back on? Do you see those lights again?

Customer: Yeah, I've got the green light again. The yellow one is still blinking.

Agent: (slight pause) Hmm. Still blinking, okay. Let me try something else here. I'm going to send a reset command to your modem from this end. That should help reinitialize everything.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (typing sounds) And... I've sent that through. Give it about 45 seconds to process.

Customer: Should I, like, check my phone or try to connect or anything?

Agent: Let's just wait for the modem to finish cycling. Then we can test the connection. (pause) Actually, real quick—are you connected via WiFi or with an ethernet cable?

Customer: WiFi. My laptop's about fifteen feet from the router.

Agent: Okay, and that's normally worked fine before?

Customer: Yeah, no problems before today. I get pretty good signal in my office.

Agent: Alright. Go ahead and try connecting now. See if you can... maybe pull up a web page or something.

Customer: (pause, clicking sounds) I'm... trying to connect to the WiFi network. It's showing as available but it's just... it's not connecting. It's saying "can't connect to this network." I've tried it twice.

Agent: Okay, um. (pause) Let me ask you this—when you look at your WiFi networks, does it show just the one Frontier network or are there others?

Customer: There's like three or four networks showing up. Mine is the one that says "FRONTIER-0147." That's the one I always use.

Agent: Right, that's correct. That's your network. And it's showing up, so the router is broadcasting. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to have you try a full factory reset on the router. This will clear everything and set it back to defaults. We'll have to set up your WiFi password again, but it should resolve any configuration issues.

Customer: Uh... will I lose anything? Like, do I have files saved on it or...?

Agent: No, no. The router itself doesn't store personal files. You might have to reconnect any devices you had previously, but everything on your computer will be fine.

Customer: Okay, how do I do that?

Agent: There should be a small recessed button on the back of the router. It might say "Reset" next to it. Do you see that?

Customer: (sounds of movement, pause) Yeah, I see it. It's really tiny.

Agent: Exactly. You'll need to press and hold that for about ten seconds. Use a paperclip or something small.

Customer: Okay, I've got a paperclip. (pause) Pressing it now. (pause) How long do I hold it?

Agent: Ten seconds should do it. You might see all the lights go off and come back on. That's normal.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's... lights are off. (longer pause) And they're coming back on. Green one first, then the yellow is blinking again.

Agent: Alright, good. That's what we want to see. Give it a minute or two to fully start up. Then try connecting to the WiFi again, okay?

Customer: (pause) Okay, trying now. (pause) I'm... it's asking for a password. I think it reset to the default.

Agent: That makes sense. There should be a sticker on the router—usually on the bottom—that has the default WiFi password. Can you find that?

Customer: Let me flip it over. (sound of router being moved) Yeah, I see it. The password is... "Frontier1234." Is that right?

Agent: That sounds right. Go ahead and enter that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm entering it... and... (pause) it's still not connecting. It says "Couldn't connect. Password may be incorrect" or something like that.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Okay, try it again. Sometimes it takes a couple attempts. Make sure there are no spaces or anything.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. Same message.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, I'm, uh... I'm checking the modem signal here on my end and I'm showing a really weak connection. Almost like the signal isn't even reaching the modem properly. (pause) Have you had any recent work done on your line? Any digging in your yard or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. I mean, there are some construction vehicles in the neighborhood, like two blocks over, but I don't think they've been near my house.

Agent: Could be worth checking on, but I don't think that's it. (pause) James, I think what we're dealing with here might be a line issue or potentially a modem problem. I'm gonna need to have a technician come out and take a look at your setup.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need to get this working today.

Agent: Let me check availability. (typing sounds, pause) I'm seeing we have availability today between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works. I mean, it's not ideal, but... I need to get online.

Agent: Okay, great. Let me get that scheduled for you. Can I get a callback number to confirm the appointment?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, I've got you scheduled for today between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will come take a look at the line and the modem. You should receive a confirmation text shortly.

Customer: Okay. Thanks for trying to fix it remotely, at least.

Agent: I wish we could have gotten it working from here, James. But the technician will have the tools to diagnose the issue properly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll just... wait for the technician.

Agent: Sounds good. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and sorry again for the trouble. You should be back online soon.

Customer: Alright, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Take care, James. Bye.
