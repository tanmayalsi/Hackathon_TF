Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And your name?

Customer: It's Michael. Michael Patterson.

Agent: Got it, Michael. So you're experiencing no internet connection at all? Can you walk me through what you've noticed?

Customer: Yeah, so when I woke up this morning around 7 AM, the modem lights weren't doing their normal thing. Like, usually they're solid or blinking, but now they're just... nothing. Well, actually, there's a red light on, I think.

Agent: Okay, a red light. That's helpful. So the modem is powered on, but you're seeing a red indicator light. Let me pull up your account here. (pause, typing) Alright, I'm seeing your service address is on Oak Street, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. Okay Michael, let's try some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me—is your modem plugged in? I know it sounds simple, but—

Customer: (chuckles) Yeah, yeah, it's plugged in. I checked that first thing.

Agent: Great, great. And the power cable is secure on both ends?

Customer: Yeah, it looks good to me.

Agent: Okay. Now, next to the modem, is there a router, or are they combined into one unit?

Customer: They're separate. I've got the modem and then a router next to it.

Agent: Perfect. Is the router powered on as well?

Customer: Yes, the router has lights on it. They're green and blinking like normal. So I'm thinking maybe it's just the modem that's the issue?

Agent: That could be the case. Let's do a power cycle on the modem to see if that helps. Can you unplug the modem for me?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. While we wait, I want to mention that we did have some weather in your area last night. We're checking for outages, but let's see if this helps first. Go ahead and leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds.

Customer: Sure thing. (pause) Okay, it's been about thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now plug it back in for me.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's back in. (pause) The lights are... okay, so I'm seeing some lights now. There's like a white light, and it's blinking, and there's still that red light.

Agent: Alright, so we've got some activity. That white light should go solid in a moment once it's fully booted up. Give it about two minutes and see if you get an internet connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'll wait. (longer pause) Still blinking. Still red.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Is the white light still blinking, or has it changed?

Customer: Yeah, the white light is still blinking. And that red light is constant.

Agent: The red light staying constant, that's unusual. Can you tell me—do you see any other lights on the modem? Any yellow or green ones?

Customer: Let me look closer... (pause) I see a green light on one of the ports, but I'm not totally sure what that means.

Agent: That green light on the port just means there's a connection there. That's normal. But the constant red light is indicating a problem. Michael, I'm going to check something on my end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me, has the modem been working fine up until this morning?

Customer: Yeah, it's been working great for the past few months. No issues at all.

Agent: Got it. And you didn't experience a power outage at your house or anything like that?

Customer: Actually, now that you mention it, we did have a pretty bad storm last night. Like, around midnight or so. I didn't think about it, but maybe that caused something?

Agent: That could definitely be it. Storms can sometimes cause issues with the modem. Let me check our system for any outages or service issues in your area. (pause, typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any active outages on your street, which is good news. But your modem might have been damaged by a power surge from the storm.

Customer: Oh no, really?

Agent: It's possible. Let me try one more thing before we go down that road. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem from my end. It might take a moment.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, I've sent that signal. Can you tell me if anything changes on the modem?

Customer: (pause) Hmm, no, not really. Same thing. White light blinking, red light solid.

Agent: Okay, and you haven't plugged anything new into it recently? Or changed any cables?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Everything's the same as it was yesterday.

Agent: Alright. Let me try another approach. Can you unplug the modem again, but this time also unplug the router?

Customer: Sure. (sounds of unplugging) Okay, both unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now leave them unplugged for a full minute this time. This is a deeper reset.

Customer: (longer pause) Alright, about a minute has passed.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug in the modem first, and then about thirty seconds later, plug in the router.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Modem's plugged in... (pause) Now the router. (sounds of plugging in) Okay, they're both back on.

Agent: Great. Let me know what you're seeing on the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... I'm seeing the same lights again. The white one is blinking. The red light is back on, solid. This doesn't look any different.

Agent: (pause) Hmm, okay. Michael, I hate to say this, but based on what I'm seeing here and what you're describing, it sounds like your modem may have actually been damaged by the power surge from the storm. That red light staying solid typically indicates a hardware failure.

Customer: Oh man, really? So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it means the modem itself likely needs to be replaced. The good news is that Frontier can send you a replacement modem at no charge. I can set that up for you right now.

Customer: How long will that take? I really need internet for work.

Agent: (pause) Typically, we can get a modem to you within 2 to 3 business days. Sometimes sooner if you're in a priority delivery zone. Let me see... (typing sounds) Yeah, looks like we can get one to you by Wednesday.

Customer: That's... not ideal, but I understand. Can you also check if this is covered under my plan? I mean, this was due to a storm, not my fault.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) I'm checking that now. Unfortunately, physical damage from weather events like storms isn't typically covered under our standard protection plan. However, let me see what I can do. Hold on just one second.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) (pause) Michael? I've checked with my supervisor, and unfortunately we can't waive the replacement fee in this case since it would be considered weather-related damage. However, I can offer you a 20% discount on the replacement modem, and we'll also give you a credit for the next two months of service since you'll be without internet.

Customer: (pause) So I still have to pay for the modem?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. But with the discount, it's $49.99 instead of the regular price of $79.99. And with the two-month credit, it does help offset some of the inconvenience.

Customer: (sighs) Alright, I guess that's better than nothing. Can you go ahead and set that up for me?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll order that replacement modem right now. Is the address on file still correct? Oak Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. Alright, Michael, I've submitted your order for the replacement modem. You should receive a shipping notification within the next 24 hours, and it should arrive by Wednesday. In the meantime, I'm going to add a $10 credit to your account for each of the next two months, which should appear on your next bill.

Customer: Okay. And there's nothing else we can try to fix the modem I have now?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, based on everything we've tried and the symptoms you're describing, I'm pretty confident the modem has failed. At this point, trying anything else would just be shooting in the dark. The replacement is really your best option.

Customer: Yeah, I understand. Alright, so Wednesday, I'm looking for the modem to arrive. Anything I need to do to prepare?

Agent: When it arrives, just follow the setup instructions that come in the box. If you need help installing it, feel free to give us a call back and we can walk you through it. But typically it's pretty straightforward—just unplug the old modem and plug in the new one.

Customer: Got it. Alright, Derek, I appreciate you trying to help. I'm just frustrated, you know?

Agent: I totally understand, Michael. I know this is frustrating, especially with the timing. But we'll get you back online by Wednesday. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome. And again, I apologize for the inconvenience. You should see that replacement modem arrive by Wednesday. If you have any issues when it arrives, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day, Michael.

Customer: You too. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Goodbye.
