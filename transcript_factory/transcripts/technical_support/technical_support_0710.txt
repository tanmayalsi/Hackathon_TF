Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, uh, yeah. Hi Derek. So my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I work from home and I've got meetings all afternoon.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... hold on. (pause) It's 555-0147. That's the last four digits of my phone number associated with it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing an account for Robert Chen at 412 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yep, that's me.

Agent: Okay, Robert. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you had any recent storms in your area, or did anything else change recently?

Customer: No, uh... nothing that I'm aware of. The weather's actually been pretty nice today. It just... it just stopped working. I turned it off and back on, which usually helps, but nothing happened this time.

Agent: Alright, that's a good troubleshooting step. Let me ask you a few more questions. When you say it stopped working, are you not seeing any lights on your modem or router at all? Or are they lit up?

Customer: The modem's got some lights on it. They're... um... (pause) there's a red light that's just steady. And the router behind it, I don't think any of those lights are on.

Agent: Okay, so we've got a red light on the modem. That typically indicates no connection. Let me have you do a full power cycle here. Can you go ahead and unplug both your modem and your router?

Customer: Yeah, unplugging now. (pause) Okay, they're both unplugged.

Agent: Great. Can you leave them unplugged for about thirty seconds? I'll time us here.

Customer: Sure thing. (long pause) ... Still unplugging them?

Agent: Yeah, we're getting close. About ten more seconds... alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) It's plugged in. Now what?

Agent: Okay, so the modem should start going through its boot-up sequence. This might take a minute or two. You should see the lights cycling through different colors.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm seeing... it's doing something. There's a white light now that's blinking.

Agent: Perfect. That's what we want to see. While that's booting up, go ahead and plug your router back in.

Customer: Done. (pause) Okay, so now the router's lighting up too. I'm seeing some blue lights.

Agent: Excellent. Let me have you give it another minute or so to fully boot up and establish a connection. Why don't you grab your phone or a device and see if you can connect to your WiFi network while we wait?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm... I'm looking at my WiFi networks. I can see my Frontier network name there. Let me connect to it.

Agent: Great.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, it's asking for the password. Let me... (pause) Okay, I'm typing it in. (pause) It says I've connected to the network.

Agent: Perfect! Now let me have you open up a web browser and try going to a website. Maybe Google or something simple like that.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm opening Chrome right now. (longer pause) [inaudible] ...it's loading but... it's taking forever. The page isn't loading. It's just... (pause) it timed out.

Agent: Alright, let me try something else. Can you go back to your computer and... do you have a Windows or Mac?

Customer: Windows.

Agent: Okay, can you bring up your command prompt? That's C-M-D if you search for it.

Customer: Yeah, I'm... I'm doing that now. (pause) Okay, I've got a black window open.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to have you ping our gateway. Type in exactly this: ping 8.8.8.8

Customer: (pause) Okay, um, ping... 8.8.8.8. (pause) It says... it says destination host unreachable?

Agent: Okay, so we're not getting a connection to the internet even though the modem and router are powered up. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm. I'm not seeing any service issues in your area, which is good news. But I am seeing that your modem might not be fully synced with our network. Let me try running a diagnostic on it remotely.

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent: This might take a minute. (pause) (typing sounds) (longer pause) Alright, so the diagnostic ran and... unfortunately, I'm not seeing a solid connection between the modem and our network infrastructure. This could be a few things—it could be a configuration issue with the modem itself, or it could be a problem with the equipment.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Can we fix it?

Agent: Well, let me try one more thing. I'm going to have you do a factory reset on your modem. This is going to clear all the settings, so I'll need to reconfigure it after, but it sometimes helps with these connection issues.

Customer: Okay, how do I do that?

Agent: There should be a small recessed button on the back of your modem. You'll need a paperclip or something thin to press it. Hold it down for about ten seconds while the modem is powered on.

Customer: (pause) Hold on, I'm going to... (pause) I'm looking at the back of it... Yeah, I see a small hole here. Let me find a paperclip. (longer pause) Okay, I'm pressing it... holding it... (pause) The lights just went out.

Agent: Good, that's what should happen. Let's let it boot back up now.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, it's... the lights are coming back. I'm seeing the white light blinking again like before.

Agent: Alright, let's give it another minute to fully boot up from the factory reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay... still booting I guess. (longer pause) Alright, I'm seeing... it's the same thing as before. White light on the modem, blue lights on the router.

Agent: Let me try accessing the modem's admin panel remotely to see if I can reconfigure it from here.

Customer: (pause) Uh... I'm not really... I don't know if that's working. The internet's still not... I'm trying to load a page again and it's just... nothing.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Yeah, unfortunately, Robert, I'm running into some limitations on my end. The modem is still not syncing properly with our network after the reset. This is typically an indicator that either the modem itself is experiencing a hardware failure, or there's an issue on the line side coming into your home.

Customer: So what... what do I do? I really need my internet back today.

Agent: I completely understand. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to your location. They'll be able to test the line and potentially replace the modem if that's the issue. Let me see what I can schedule for you. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so the earliest appointment we have available is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really needed it today...

Agent: I know, and I wish I had something available this afternoon. We're pretty booked up today unfortunately. But our technician should be able to get you up and running pretty quickly tomorrow. They're very efficient.

Customer: (sigh) Yeah... okay. I guess that'll have to work. Can I at least do anything else tonight?

Agent: Unfortunately, at this point with the factory reset not resolving the issue, I don't have any other troubleshooting steps I can walk you through. The next step really does need to be an in-person visit from a technician. I'll get that scheduled for you tomorrow morning though, and I'm going to add a note to your account about everything we've tried today so the technician will know exactly what's been done.

Customer: Alright. Yeah, okay. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: No, just make sure someone's home to let them in. And if you could have your modem and router accessible, that would be helpful. The appointment window is 8 AM to 12 PM tomorrow. You should get a call about thirty minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Got it. Okay.

Agent: I apologize again that we couldn't get this resolved today, Robert. I know how disruptive this is when you work from home.

Customer: Yeah, it's frustrating, but... I appreciate you trying. Hopefully it gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: Absolutely. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. Bye.

Agent: Bye, Robert.
