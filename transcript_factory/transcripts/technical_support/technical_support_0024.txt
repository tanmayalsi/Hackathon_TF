# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. Um, so my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the router and everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Uh, yeah, it's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that now. And can I get your name for verification?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. So you mentioned the internet went out about an hour ago and you've already tried restarting the router?

Customer: Yeah, I unplugged it, waited like five minutes, plugged it back in. The lights came back on like normal, but I'm still not getting any connection. Like, nothing. It's completely dead.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let me ask you a few questions. When you look at the modem—that's the box that the fiber line connects to—what color are the lights on it?

Customer: Um... (pause) okay, so I'm looking at it now. There's like... I see a green light and then there's a red light blinking.

Agent: Okay, a red blinking light. That's actually helpful. That typically indicates there might be a signal issue. Is there a light that says "Online" or "Internet"?

Customer: (pause) Let me... yeah, yeah there is. It says "Internet" and it's... it's red.

Agent: Okay, so the Internet light is red. That means the modem isn't connecting to our network. Before we go further, can you check if your fiber line is securely plugged into the modem? It's the cable that comes into your house from outside.

Customer: Hold on... (pause) Yeah, I'm checking it now. Um, it looks pretty secure from what I can see. It's, uh... it's in there pretty tight.

Agent: Good. Now, have you noticed any visible damage to that cable? Any cuts or anything that looks unusual?

Customer: No, it looks fine to me. It's just sitting there normal, you know?

Agent: Alright. Let me try a couple things from my end here. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem. This should only take a minute or two. Can you keep an eye on those lights while I do this?

Customer: Yeah, okay. I'm watching it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, sending that through now. Let me know if you see any changes.

Customer: (pause) I'm still seeing the red light on the Internet indicator. The green light is there too, but the Internet one is still red.

Agent: Hm, okay. Let me try one more thing. I'm going to restart your modem from here. This might take about three to five minutes, so the lights might go off and then back on. Just give me a heads up when you see them come back.

Customer: Alright, I'm ready.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, initiating that restart now.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the lights just went off. Everything's dark now.

Agent: Perfect, that's what should happen. Just give it a minute or two to cycle back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, they're coming back... green light's on... (pause) ...and the Internet light is... (sighs) ...it's still red.

Agent: It's still red, okay. (pause) That's unusual. When we see that after a restart, it usually indicates a larger issue on our network side or possibly with the line itself. Let me check our systems here to see if there are any outages in your area.

Customer: Is that a common thing? Like, should I be worried?

Agent: It's not super common, but it does happen occasionally. Let me pull up our outage map. (typing sounds) What's your address, James?

Customer: It's 447 Maple Street. That's M-A-P-L-E. Apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm checking that location now. (pause) I'm not seeing any active outages reported in your area right now. That's actually... hmm.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be a line issue specific to your address, or it could be that the modem itself is having a problem. Have you had any recent storms or anything like that in your area?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear all week. That's the weird thing—it just stopped working out of nowhere.

Agent: Yeah, that does sound strange. Okay, so let me try one more troubleshooting step. I want you to unplug the modem for about thirty seconds, and then when you plug it back in, I want you to notice if that red light ever changes. Does it turn green at any point, or does it stay red the whole time?

Customer: Okay, doing it now. (pause) It's unplugged. (pause) Alright, plugging it back in... and the lights are coming on. I see the green light. And the Internet light is... (pause) ...red. It's immediately red, and it's just staying red.

Agent: (pause) It's not even trying to connect then. Okay, so... that's pointing more toward either a line issue or a modem issue. Because normally, right after a restart, that light will be amber or yellow for a bit while it's connecting, and then it should turn green. The fact that it's going straight to red is...

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is my modem broken?

Agent: It could be, but I want to eliminate other possibilities first. Let me see if I can run a diagnostic on the modem from my end. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm attempting to access the modem now. (pause) Hm, I'm not able to communicate with it at all, which makes sense if it can't connect to the network, but it does suggest that the modem might not be initializing properly. 

Customer: So now what? Do I need a new modem or something?

Agent: Well, here's the thing. Normally what I'd recommend is that we schedule a technician to come out to your location. They can check the line, check the modem setup, and if the modem is indeed faulty, they can replace it. But before we do that... when did you get your modem, do you remember?

Customer: Um, I think I've had it for like... three years? Maybe a little longer? It came with my installation when I signed up.

Agent: Okay. And before today, was the internet working normally? No drops or anything like that?

Customer: No, it was working great. I mean, no complaints. That's why this is so frustrating. It just died.

Agent: I completely understand. (pause) Alright, so let me try one last thing before we talk about getting a technician out there. Can you do me a favor and check your fiber jack? That's the optical connection point where the fiber line terminates in your apartment. Is that visible to you?

Customer: (pause) Uh, I think so? There's like a small box on my wall with a little port on it? Is that it?

Agent: That sounds like it, yeah. Can you check and see if the little cover is on it? Like a small plastic cap?

Customer: (pause) No, there's no cap. It's just... open.

Agent: Okay, that's actually fine. Now, the connector that's plugged into it—does it look like it's seated all the way in? Sometimes those can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Let me... I'm looking at it. It seems... I mean, it looks like it's in there, but let me try pushing it in a little more. (pause) Okay, I'm giving it a gentle push.

Agent: Do you see anything? Any changes?

Customer: (pause) No... nothing's changing. The modem still has the red light.

Agent: (pause, sighs) Okay. I've run through most of the standard troubleshooting steps, James, and unfortunately, we're not getting the modem to connect to the network. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to take a look at this. They'll be able to verify that the line is active and functioning, and they can determine whether the modem needs to be replaced.

Customer: How long would that take? And is there gonna be a charge for it?

Agent: Great questions. So if it's a line issue, there's no service charge. If it's determined to be a modem issue, since your modem is about three years old and is technically part of our network infrastructure, you shouldn't be charged for the replacement either. But if there's something else going on that's outside of normal wear and tear, there could potentially be a charge, though that's pretty rare.

Customer: Okay, and how soon can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (pause, typing sounds) So depending on your location and current technician availability, we can typically get someone out within the next 24 to 48 hours. I can schedule you for tomorrow if you'd like, or we can do later this week if that works better for you.

Customer: Tomorrow would be great, honestly. I really need this fixed.

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm pulling up the appointment scheduler here. What time works best for you tomorrow? We typically have morning slots between 8 and 12, or afternoon slots between 12 and 5.

Customer: Um, morning would be better for me. Anytime in that window.

Agent: Perfect. I'm booking you for tomorrow morning between 8 AM and 12 PM. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive so you know when to expect them. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Like, should I keep the modem unplugged or...?

Agent: Actually, you can leave it plugged in. That way, if the technician needs to do any testing, the modem is ready to go. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I hope so too, James. I know how frustrating it is to be without internet. The technician will take good care of you. Your appointment is confirmed for tomorrow morning, and you should expect a call about 30 minutes before they arrive. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll get this sorted out for you.

Customer: Thanks for your help, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
