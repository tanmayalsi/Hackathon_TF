# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Marcus. Um, my internet isn't working at all. I've had it for like two years with no problems, but this morning I woke up and there's just... nothing. No connection.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick so we can figure out what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at the account here for... is this Steve Martinez?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're not getting any internet connection at all right now. When did this start happening?

Customer: This morning, like around 6 AM. I went to check my email and just... nothing. The Wi-Fi symbol had that little X on it, you know?

Agent: Got it. Okay, so first things first—let's do some basic troubleshooting. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Do you have any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um, yeah. So the modem has... let me look at it... it's got a couple lights on. There's like a green one and a red one blinking.

Agent: Okay, which light is blinking red? Is it the internet light or the power light?

Customer: I think it's... honestly, I'm not super close to it right now. Give me a second. (pause) Yeah, it looks like the one that says "Internet" is red.

Agent: That's actually what we're looking for. That tells me the modem is powered on but it's not connecting to our network. Do you have a router separate from the modem?

Customer: I do, yeah. It's like one of those Frontier ones you guys gave me when I signed up.

Agent: Perfect. And what's happening with that? Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Yeah, it's got some blue lights, I think. They're on.

Agent: Okay, good. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to unplug the modem from the wall—that's the box that connects directly to the cable line—wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. This'll restart it and sometimes that fixes these connection issues.

Customer: Alright, I'm doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and count to thirty or so, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in... (background noise) ...it's back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now, what we should see is the modem go through a startup sequence. There'll be some lights that flash and change. Give that about two minutes and then tell me what you're seeing.

Customer: Okay, I'm watching it... the lights are doing something. There's a lot of blinking right now.

Agent: That's normal, that's what we want to see. Let's give it another minute or so and then we'll check again.

Customer: (pause) Alright, um... okay, so the green light is still on but the Internet light is still red.

Agent: Hmm, still red. Okay. (typing sounds) Let me ask you a couple more questions. Have you noticed any storms in your area recently or any outages?

Customer: Not that I know of. The weather's been fine. Why?

Agent: Just checking. Sometimes weather can affect the connection. Has anything changed with your setup recently? Any new equipment or did you move anything around?

Customer: No, everything's been the same for months.

Agent: Alright. Let me try one more thing with you. Can you go ahead and check the connections on the back of the modem? I want to make sure the cable that comes in from the wall is firmly connected.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me get back there... (rustling) Okay, I'm looking at it. There's a cable that goes into the modem and... it looks pretty tight to me. Like, it's definitely plugged in.

Agent: Can you just give it a little wiggle and make sure? Sometimes these connections can get loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm jiggling it a bit and... no, it seems pretty solid.

Agent: Alright. You know what, let me look at your modem signal levels real quick. (typing sounds) Hmm, that's strange. I'm not actually seeing any signal coming into your modem at all on my end.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: It means the signal from our network isn't reaching your modem. This could be a few things—it could be an issue with the line coming into your house, or there could be something happening on our end. Let me check your area for any known outages. (pause) I'm not showing any outages on your street...

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: Well, I'm going to need to escalate this to our technical team. They can run some diagnostics on the line itself and figure out if there's a break somewhere or if it's something we need to come out and check on our side. Before I do that though, let's try one more thing. Can you restart your router as well?

Customer: Sure. How do I do that?

Agent: Unplug the power cable from the back of the router—the smaller box—wait thirty seconds, and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, doing that now... (pause) Alright, it's restarted.

Agent: Great. Give that another minute to fully boot up. (pause) Anything changing on the modem lights?

Customer: No, um... still the same. Green light on, red Internet light blinking.

Agent: (sigh) Okay, Steve. I really wish I could get this fixed for you right now, but unfortunately, we're going to need to send a technician out to your location to do some line testing. This is beyond what we can troubleshoot over the phone.

Customer: Really? How long is that gonna take?

Agent: Let me see what's available in your area. (typing sounds) I can get someone out to you tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or... the soonest availability I'm seeing after that is Thursday afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow's fine, I guess. I just... I need this working.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me just confirm your address here. (pause) You're at 4782 Pinewood Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm scheduling a technician visit for tomorrow, Tuesday, between 1 and 5 PM. They'll run diagnostics on your line and your equipment. Is that number on the account—555-0147—still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell. Will they call before they come?

Agent: They should. You'll get a call within the window, usually about thirty minutes before they arrive. I'm also going to put a note on your account about what we've tried, so they'll know what's been done.

Customer: Okay. And there's nothing I can do in the meantime?

Agent: At this point, I'd just recommend keeping the modem and router powered on so they can see what's happening when they test it. Don't try any other restarts or anything like that. Just leave it as is.

Customer: Alright, I will.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience, Steve. I know having no internet is really frustrating. We'll get you back up and running as soon as possible.

Customer: Yeah, I appreciate your help anyway, Marcus.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. I guess I'll just wait for the technician tomorrow.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and again, sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone. Have a good day.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
