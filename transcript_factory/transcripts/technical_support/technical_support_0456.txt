Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls scheduled and I'm kind of freaking out here.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I totally understand how frustrating that is. Let me help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the number on the bill.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm pulling up your account now. And your name is...?

Customer: James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Great, James. I've got you here. So your internet went down this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, around 7 AM or so. I tried unplugging the modem and router like I usually do when stuff acts weird, but nothing. They've been off for like... I don't know, five minutes each time.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting step. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Do you see any lights on the modem right now?

Customer: Um, yeah. There's a... there's a green light on the front. And I think there's a red light next to it? Or orange maybe?

Agent: Okay, so the red or orange light—that's typically the internet light, and that usually indicates there's no connection. Can you tell me, is the device powered on? Are you looking at the front of the modem?

Customer: Yeah, the front. And yes, it's definitely on. The power light is solid green.

Agent: Good. And the red light you mentioned—is it solid, or is it blinking?

Customer: (pause) It's solid. Just... solid red.

Agent: Alright. That confirms there's no internet signal coming in. James, I'm going to walk you through a few things, okay? First, can you locate where the cable comes into your modem? That's the coaxial cable—it's the thick one with the metal connector.

Customer: Uh huh, I see it. It's plugged in back here.

Agent: Perfect. Can you unplug that cable from the modem, wait about 10 seconds, and then plug it back in? I'll wait right here.

Customer: Okay, give me one second. (pause) (rustling sounds) Alright, it's unplugged. I'm waiting... okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about a minute to reboot and establish a connection. While we're waiting, have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time in like... six months? Maybe longer. We've had pretty good service up until today.

Agent: That's good to know. Okay, so it's been about a minute. Are you seeing any changes in the lights?

Customer: (pause) Uh... no. Still the same. Green power, and that red light is still there. It's still solid.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a line test to see if we're getting a signal from the node. Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Sure, yeah.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, James. The test is showing that we are not detecting a signal on your line. That's coming from our end. A few things could be happening here. Do you happen to know if there's been any recent work done on your house? Any digging, construction, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's pretty quiet around here.

Agent: Okay. I also want to ask—have you checked the outside of your house at all? Sometimes the issue can be with the external line. Do you have access to where the line comes in from outside?

Customer: I... I'm not sure where that even is. I mean, I've never really looked.

Agent: No problem. It might be on the side or back of your house. There should be a box—it looks kind of like a small gray or white plastic box. Do you want to take a quick look?

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (pause) (rustling, door opening) Okay, I'm around the side of the house. Um... I see something. There's a box, yeah.

Agent: Great. Is it mounted on the house?

Customer: Yeah, it's mounted right here on the siding.

Agent: Perfect. Can you check if the cables connected to it look secure? Are they plugged in, or does anything look loose?

Customer: (pause) They look fine to me. I mean, I don't really know what I'm looking at, but it all seems plugged in and tight.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Um, let me try something else. Can you go back inside and restart the modem one more time? But this time, I want you to hold the power button for about 30 seconds while it's unplugged, okay?

Customer: Alright, I'm heading back in. (pause) (door closing) Okay, I'm unplugging it now. (pause) I'm holding the button. Thirty seconds... (pause) Okay, that should be good.

Agent: Now plug it back in and let it fully restart. This might take a couple of minutes. While that's happening, I'm going to check our system here to see if there are any alerts or notes on your line. (typing sounds)

Customer: (pause) Okay... it's coming back on. The lights are coming back. Power's green... (pause) ...and the internet light is still red.

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, it's still not connecting. James, based on what we're seeing here, it looks like the issue is between our network and your modem. It could be a problem with the line itself, or it could be an issue on our end affecting your service area. I'm not seeing any outage notifications in your area, which is... it's a little unusual.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it from there?

Agent: That's what I was hoping to do. Unfortunately, without that signal reaching your modem, there's not much I can do remotely. This is something that's going to require a technician to come out and investigate. What I'm going to do is schedule a service visit for you. Do you have availability tomorrow or the day after?

Customer: (sighs) Tomorrow would be better, honestly. I really need this working.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) I can schedule you for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. That works.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, James, I've got you scheduled for tomorrow morning. A technician will arrive between 8 and noon. They'll bring testing equipment and should be able to identify what's causing the problem. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just hope they can fix it quickly.

Agent: I understand. For what it's worth, it could be something simple once they get out there. You'll receive a confirmation email and a text message with the technician's details. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for trying, anyway.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. We really appreciate your patience, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
