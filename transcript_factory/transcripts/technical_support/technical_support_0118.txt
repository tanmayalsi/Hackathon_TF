Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online as quickly as we can. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing your address as 2840 Maple Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you're saying your internet went down this morning. Do you remember what time that was approximately?

Customer: Uh, I'd say around 8 o'clock? Maybe 8:15. I tried restarting my router but nothing happened.

Agent: Okay, so you've already done a restart. That's helpful. Let me ask you a few questions to narrow this down. When you look at your router right now, what lights are you seeing on it?

Customer: Um... (pause) Let me look. Okay, so there's... the power light is on, that's green. But the internet light—I think it's the blue one?—that one's off. Or it's red? I'm not totally sure which one is which, to be honest.

Agent: No problem, no problem. So the power light is green, which is good. And the other light that would indicate your internet connection—that's probably not lit up or it might be blinking red. Can you tell me if it's blinking or just solid?

Customer: It's just... it looks like it's off. Like, not lit up at all.

Agent: Alright. And have you checked to see if the cable going into your modem is secure? Sometimes these things can come loose, especially if there's been any activity near your equipment.

Customer: (pause) Let me check. (rustling sounds) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. The cables look pretty tight to me. There's one coming from the wall and one going to my computer... or, wait, I think that goes to my WiFi box or whatever.

Agent: That's okay. So you've got the main cable from the wall going into the modem, and that appears to be secure. Good. Let me just verify—are you able to see any lights on the modem at all right now, besides the power light?

Customer: No, I don't think so. Just the green power light.

Agent: Okay. And just to confirm, you did try unplugging the router, waiting a minute, and plugging it back in?

Customer: Yeah, I did that this morning. I left it off for like... a minute or two, then plugged it back in. Nothing changed.

Agent: Alright. (typing sounds) Let me see what we have here. I'm actually not showing any outages in your area right now, so this appears to be specific to your connection. I'd like to try a factory reset on your modem to see if that helps. Have you ever done that before?

Customer: A factory reset? No, I haven't. How do I do that?

Agent: Sure, I can walk you through it. So on the back of your modem, there's a small button, usually recessed, labeled "Reset." You'll need something like a paperclip or a pen to press it. Go ahead and find that for me.

Customer: (rustling, background noise) Okay, I'm looking... I see it. Yeah, there's a little button that says "Reset."

Agent: Perfect. Now what we're going to do is have your modem powered on, and I want you to hold that reset button down for about ten seconds. This will restore it to factory settings. Ready?

Customer: Yeah, I'm ready. (pause) Okay, I'm holding it down... ten seconds... (pause) Okay, I let go. Now what?

Agent: Now we're going to wait about two to three minutes while the modem reboots. During this time, all the lights should go through a startup sequence. You should see them flickering on and off. Go ahead and give me a call back when it finishes booting up, or... actually, just wait and let me know when it's done.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it now. The power light is still green, and now I'm seeing... yeah, some of the other lights are coming on. There's like a white light and... (pause) ...and it's blinking.

Agent: Great! That blinking is totally normal during the startup. Just give it another minute or so to fully complete the boot process.

Customer: (pause) Okay. (longer pause) Um, the blinking stopped on that one but now the other one's blinking.

Agent: That's fine, that's all part of the startup sequence. Just... just give it about another thirty seconds or so.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it seems like... I think it's settled now? The lights aren't blinking anymore.

Agent: Excellent. And what lights are you seeing that are solid now?

Customer: I'm seeing green, and blue... and I think there's red? There's definitely multiple lights on now.

Agent: Okay, that sounds more normal. Are you able to try connecting to your WiFi network now? Go ahead and check your phone or computer and see if your WiFi network is appearing.

Customer: (pause) Let me check my phone. (pause) Hmm. I'm not seeing it in my WiFi list. That's... that's not good.

Agent: It might take another minute or two to fully establish the connection. Why don't you give it a couple more minutes and then try again?

Customer: (pause) Okay. (longer pause) Still nothing. The WiFi network isn't showing up.

Agent: Alright, let me take a look at what's happening on our end here. (typing sounds) Hmm, that's strange. I'm not seeing your modem as connected to our network right now. Let me... (pause) ...let me try to send a signal to your modem to see if we can establish a connection from our side.

Customer: Okay. How long does that usually take?

Agent: It should be pretty quick. Just give me a moment here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I've sent that signal out, but I'm still not seeing your modem come online. That suggests there might be an issue with the connection between your modem and our network. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Is there something wrong with the modem itself?

Agent: It could be, but it could also be an issue with the signal coming into your home, or there could be an issue on our network side. Since the factory reset didn't resolve it, I'd like to try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem for me?

Customer: Yeah, just unplugged it.

Agent: And keep it unplugged for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) ...thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged in. (pause) Power light's back on.

Agent: Alright, and we'll wait for it to boot back up again. While that's happening, I'm going to check something on our end. I'm actually looking at the signal strength coming into your location, and... (pause) ...I'm seeing some irregularities here. It's possible you might have a line issue outside your home. Do you have any damage to the cable that runs into your house from the street? Like any cuts, or kinks, or anything like that?

Customer: Um, not that I can see. I mean, I can only see the part where it enters the house. There might be something further out, I guess?

Agent: Right, yeah. It could be anywhere along that line. At this point, we may need to send a technician out to your location to do a more thorough inspection of the line. How's that modem doing now? Is it booted up?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, looks like it. The lights are on again. But I'm still not seeing the WiFi network.

Agent: (sighs) Yeah, I'm still not seeing the connection on our end either. I think a technician visit is going to be our best option here. Let me see what we have available in your area.

Customer: How long is that going to take? I really need my internet back today for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our technician schedule. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so the earliest I can get someone out to you would be... it looks like tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Is there any way to get someone out today?

Agent: Let me see. (pause) (typing sounds) Unfortunately, our technicians in your area are fully booked for today. I apologize for that. But I want to make sure we get this sorted out for you. Would tomorrow morning work?

Customer: (frustrated) I mean, it's not ideal, but... I guess it'll have to. Can I at least use mobile hotspot in the meantime?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. That would be a good workaround for now. So I'm going to schedule a technician visit for tomorrow, September 15th, between 8 AM and noon. The technician will come inspect the line and the equipment to identify the issue. Does your address still show as 2840 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And can I get a phone number where the technician can reach you if they need to?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as my account number basically.

Agent: Great. I've got that. So just to recap, you'll have a technician visit tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. If you need to reach us before then, you can always call back. And I want to apologize again for the inconvenience. I know this is frustrating.

Customer: Yeah, well... I mean, it's not ideal, but thanks for trying to help at least.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully it gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident we'll get this resolved for you. Thanks for being patient with me today, and I apologize again for the trouble. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
