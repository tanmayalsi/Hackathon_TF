# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, and just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's right. 555 Maple Street.

Agent: Perfect. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So you've had no internet access since this morning—do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Uh, around 8 or 9 AM? I tried to work from home and nothing would load. I figured maybe I was just being impatient, but then nothing worked.

Agent: Okay, I understand. That's frustrating. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me if you're seeing any lights on your modem right now? We're looking for the Frontier Gateway device—it's a white box, usually about this size. (holds up hands)

Customer: Oh, um, yeah, it's right here on the shelf. Let me look at it. Okay, so I see... the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light—that's the blue one, right?—it's not on. It's just dark.

Agent: Alright, so the blue light is off. That usually means there's no connection to the network. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the power cable from the modem for about 30 seconds and then plug it back in?

Customer: Sure, give me a second. (sounds of movement) Okay, I'm unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Just let it sit there for about 30 seconds while I check a few things on my end.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. So while we wait... have you guys had any outages in my area? Because my neighbor mentioned something about work being done on the lines?

Agent: That's actually a good question. Let me pull up the service map for your area. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not showing any reported outages in your zip code as of right now, but that doesn't mean there hasn't been any maintenance. Can you describe what your neighbor said?

Customer: I don't know exactly, but he said he saw a Frontier truck down the street a couple days ago. I didn't think much of it at the time.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. It's possible there was some maintenance work that could be affecting your line. Have you had any other issues recently—like power outages or storms?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine.

Agent: Alright. Go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (sounds of rustling) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) It's booting up... the power light is green again. Um, the internet light is still... still not coming on. That's not a good sign, is it?

Agent: Well, let's give it a minute to fully boot. Sometimes it takes about two minutes to establish the connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been about a minute now. Nope, still nothing.

Agent: Alright. Let's try a different approach. I'm going to have you do a full factory reset on the modem. Can you locate the reset button? It's usually a small button on the back of the device. You might need a pen or paperclip to press it.

Customer: Factory reset? Won't that, like, mess things up?

Agent: Not at all. It'll just restore the modem to its default settings, and it should reconfigure itself with your account automatically. I'm right here with you through the whole process.

Customer: Okay, okay. (pause) Let me flip it around. Yeah, I see a small button here on the back. I'm going to get a pen. (pause) Alright, I'm pressing it... and holding it... okay, I can see the lights are flashing now.

Agent: Perfect, that's what we want to see. The lights should flash for about 30 to 60 seconds while it resets. Just let it do its thing.

Customer: (pause) Okay, the lights are still flashing... and now they're starting to settle down. The power light is green again. But still no blue internet light.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your line status here, and... actually, I'm seeing that your connection is inactive. That's unusual. Have you had any recent billing issues or account changes?

Customer: No, no, everything's paid up. I always pay on time.

Agent: I believe you. It's probably not that. I'm going to escalate this a bit. Can I put you on a brief hold while I reach out to our network operations team? It should just be a minute or two.

Customer: How long is this going to take? I really need internet today.

Agent: I understand. Let me see what I can find out right now. (pause) Actually, I'm going to try one more thing first. Are you able to check if there are any visible connections to your modem? Sometimes the fiber line can get loose or damaged.

Customer: Check the fiber line? I... um, I'm not really sure what I'm looking for.

Agent: Look at the back of the modem. There should be a thin cord that plugs into a port on the device—it might be in a small box attached to the wall nearby. It's usually orange or yellow.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see there's like a cord coming into the wall. Um, let me follow where it goes. It's connected to the modem. It looks like it's plugged in pretty tight, I mean, it seems secure.

Agent: Okay, good. And you're not seeing any obvious damage to the cord or anything?

Customer: No, it looks fine to me. It's just the regular cord.

Agent: Alright. At this point, I think we might be looking at an issue on the network side that I can't fully diagnose from here. (pause) I'm going to need to escalate this to our technical operations team. They can run some more advanced diagnostics on your line. Typically, they'll respond within 24 hours, but sometimes it can be quicker depending on the issue.

Customer: 24 hours? Are you serious? I need internet now. I have work I need to do.

Agent: I completely understand how frustrating that is. Let me see if I can prioritize this. What kind of work are you doing? Do you need—

Customer: (interrupting) It's just emails and some file uploads, but still, I need to be able to access my work systems.

Agent: Right, yeah. Let me make a note here that this is urgent for you. (typing sounds) I'm going to flag this as a priority ticket and add a note that you have work-dependent internet needs. I also want to send a technician out to your location if we can't resolve this remotely. Would you be available tomorrow?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be best. I need this working by the afternoon.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me check our scheduling system. We have availability between 8 AM and 12 PM tomorrow. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Great. A technician will be out to your location at 555 Maple Street between 8 AM and noon tomorrow. They'll be able to check the fiber connection outside your home, test the line, and determine if there's a hardware issue or a line issue. Is there anything else I can help clarify?

Customer: No, I guess not. But just so I'm clear, you couldn't figure out what's wrong with it?

Agent: At this point, I've ruled out some common issues—the modem itself seems to be functioning, and the connection appears to be inactive on our network side. That typically means either there's a problem with the fiber line coming into your home, or there's an issue at the network termination point in your neighborhood. The technician tomorrow will be able to physically inspect everything and should be able to identify the exact problem.

Customer: Okay, I guess I don't have much choice. So the technician will just show up?

Agent: They'll call you about 30 minutes before they arrive, so you'll know when to expect them. Your confirmation number for this ticket is 847629. I'm going to send that to the email address we have on file, which is... (pause) is that still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. You'll receive an email confirmation along with a tracking number for the appointment. Is there anything else I can do for you today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully this gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I hope so too. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this today, but I'm confident our technical team will get to the bottom of it tomorrow. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and I appreciate your patience.

Customer: Yeah, thanks.

Agent: Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
