Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back on. I've tried unplugging everything and plugging it back in, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. I'm showing service to that address in Portland, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned you've already done a restart. Let me ask you a few questions to help narrow this down. When you say the internet is out, are any of the lights on your modem or router showing right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it. The modem has... it's got one light that's red, I think? And on the router, I don't see anything at all. Like, no lights.

Agent: Alright, okay. The red light on the modem typically indicates an issue with the connection. Can you tell me what color the light was before it went out?

Customer: I mean, it was usually green, I think? I don't really pay that much attention to it normally, to be honest.

Agent: That's completely understandable. Most people don't. Okay, so what I'd like you to do is unplug the modem directly from the wall outlet. Not just the power button—actually unplug the cable.

Customer: Okay, yeah. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And while we wait, let me just check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area right now, which is good news. That usually means it's something we can resolve. Can you leave that unplugged for about thirty seconds?

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (pause) While we're waiting, have you noticed anything else unusual? Any weird sounds from the equipment or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. It just... it just stopped working. I was streaming something and then it just cut out.

Agent: Okay, that actually helps. Sometimes we see things like that if there's been a power surge or something. Alright, it should be about thirty seconds now. Go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) Um... it's coming back up. I see some lights. There's like a white light and... okay, now I see orange.

Agent: Orange is good. That usually means it's booting up. Give it about a minute or two to fully connect. Just let me know when you see the lights stabilize.

Customer: (pause) Alright, so it's been a minute. I'm still seeing orange and white lights, but no green yet.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Okay, that's taking a bit longer than usual. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) I'm actually showing that there might be a line issue on our end. Let me see... can you tell me—have you had any recent weather or anything that might affect the line outside your house?

Customer: No, it's been clear all day. Pretty nice out, actually.

Agent: Okay, good. Um, one more thing I want to try. Can you unplug the router as well? Sometimes the router can get stuck if it's trying to connect to a modem that's not fully online yet.

Customer: The separate box, right? The Wi-Fi thing?

Agent: Exactly, yeah. The Wi-Fi router.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. How long do I wait this time?

Agent: Just thirty seconds, same as before. (pause) So while we're doing this, I do want to let you know that I'm going to need to escalate this if we can't get it back online in the next few minutes. We may need to send a technician out to check the line.

Customer: Oh no, really? How long would that take?

Agent: Well, let me see if we can get this working first. But if we do need to send someone, we usually have availability within the next two to three business days. (pause) Go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. So... I'm looking at the modem again and now it's... it's back to red. It was doing better a second ago and now it's just red again.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let me check something. Are you near a window where you can see the line coming into your house? The fiber line from outside?

Customer: Oh, uh... yeah, I can go look. Hang on. (pause) Okay, I'm looking. The line looks fine from what I can see. I don't see anything damaged or anything.

Agent: Alright, that's good to know. (typing sounds) You know what, I think what might be happening here is that our line is having trouble syncing with your modem. Let me try resetting the modem from our end. Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) [inaudible background noise]

Agent: Okay, I've sent the reset command. You should see the lights flash or reset in about thirty seconds. Just watch and let me know what happens.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see them flashing. They're kind of... flickering a bunch. (pause) Okay, now... it's still red again. This is frustrating. I really need my internet. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand, and I really appreciate your patience here. Unfortunately, this is looking like it's an issue on the line side that we're not able to resolve remotely. I'm going to need to get a technician scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Do you have availability tomorrow between, say, 8 AM and 12 PM?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? I mean, I guess I could make that work. How certain are they that they can fix it?

Agent: A technician will be able to physically inspect the line and the equipment and figure out what's going on. It could be a few different things—sometimes it's just a loose connection, sometimes it's a problem with the line itself. But they'll definitely be able to diagnose it and get you back up and running.

Customer: Okay, yeah. I mean, I don't really have a choice at this point. Let's do tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, December 14th, between 8 AM and noon. A technician will be out to your house. You'll get a confirmation text and email with all the details, okay?

Customer: Alright, thanks. So there's nothing else I can do tonight to try to get it working?

Agent: I wish I had better news, but at this point, I think we've exhausted the remote troubleshooting options. Your best bet would be to just leave the equipment plugged in and powered on overnight, and the technician can take it from there tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, I will. Thanks for trying, I guess. I'll see what the technician says tomorrow.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's... that's all I need. Thanks.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for calling Frontier, and we really do apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get this fixed for you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
