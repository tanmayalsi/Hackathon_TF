# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and everything, and nothing's working.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get that sorted out. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's area code 503... actually, let me find my bill. It's 503-555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get your name, please?

Customer: It's Michael. Michael Peterson.

Agent: Great, Michael. Thanks for that. Okay, I've got your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So when you say the internet went out, are you seeing any lights on the modem at all right now?

Customer: Um... there's like, one light on. It's like an amber or orange color. I think it's normally blue?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. The amber light usually means there's a connection issue. So you've already tried unplugging the modem—how long did you leave it unplugged for?

Customer: Maybe like... thirty seconds? Then I plugged it back in.

Agent: Got it. Let's try that again, but this time let's leave it unplugged for about two minutes. That'll give it a full reset. While that's happening, can you also unplug the router if you have one?

Customer: Yeah, I have a router. Okay, one second... (pause) Alright, unplugging it now.

Agent: Perfect. And just to clarify, Michael, you're not seeing any service outages in your area or anything like that on your end?

Customer: No, everything else seems fine. The TV is working, at least. Wait, no, actually I'm not sure if the TV is working. I haven't checked that.

Agent: Okay, well the TV would use a different connection, so that's not necessarily related. Let's focus on getting that modem back up. Go ahead and wait those two minutes for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, two minutes should be up now. I'm plugging the modem back in.

Agent: Great. While that boots back up, let me ask you a few more questions. When did you first notice the internet went out? Was there a storm in your area, or any kind of power outage?

Customer: No, no storm. It was just... I was working and then suddenly everything just stopped. I didn't hear any thunder or anything. The power seems fine—all my other stuff is on.

Agent: Alright. And is your modem getting power? Are you seeing any lights come back on?

Customer: (pause) I'm seeing... yeah, there's a couple lights blinking now. Should I wait?

Agent: Yes, just give it about another minute or so. It'll go through its boot-up cycle. You should see the lights stabilize once it fully connects.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so it's been like a minute or so and... I'm still just seeing that orange light. It's not turning blue.

Agent: Hmm, that's not ideal. Can you tell me which port the ethernet cable is plugged into? Is it going into the port on the bottom, or...?

Customer: Oh, um, actually I'm not using an ethernet cable. I'm on WiFi. Does that matter?

Agent: No, that's fine. That shouldn't matter. Okay, so you're not seeing the WiFi network on your phone or computer?

Customer: Correct. Nothing. No networks showing up at all.

Agent: Let me try something here. I'm going to check if there's any activity on our end. (typing sounds) Michael, have there been any recent changes to your setup? Any new equipment, or did a technician come out recently?

Customer: Not recently, no. I've had this for like... two years, I think? Maybe a little longer.

Agent: Okay, and this is the first time you're experiencing this issue?

Customer: Yeah, totally. It's been rock solid up until today.

Agent: Alright. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem again, but this time also unplug the router?

Customer: I already unplugged the router, though.

Agent: Right, right, I know. But let's go ahead and unplug the modem again while the router stays unplugged.

Customer: (pause) Okay, modem's unplugged again. Now what?

Agent: Now let's wait... thirty seconds this time, and then plug just the modem back in first. Leave the router unplugged for now.

Customer: (pause) Thirty seconds is up. Plugging it back in. (pause) Still just seeing that orange light.

Agent: Okay. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds, pause) Michael, I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, and I'm not seeing anything flagged on your line. This is... this is a bit odd. Can you try plugging the router back in now and see if we get any different results?

Customer: (pause) Alright, router's back in. (pause) No, same thing. Just the orange light on the modem.

Agent: And you're certain the ethernet cable is firmly connected to the modem? Sometimes these can come loose without you realizing it.

Customer: Well, I mean, I'm not physically looking at it right now, but I didn't touch anything. Should I go look?

Agent: Yeah, if you don't mind, that would be really helpful.

Customer: (pause, footsteps) Okay, I'm looking at it. The cable looks... I don't know, it looks plugged in to me. It's going into the port on the left side.

Agent: And there's no visible damage to the cable that you can see?

Customer: No, it looks fine. Um... wait, is the cable supposed to have those little plastic clips on the end? Because mine doesn't have one. Like, it broke off at some point.

Agent: That might be the issue, actually. Even though it looks like it's plugged in, it might not be making a solid connection. Can you try reseating it? Just unplug it completely and plug it back in firmly?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's back in. (pause) Still just the orange light.

Agent: (sigh) Alright, Michael, I'm going to be honest with you. I think what we might be looking at here is either a hardware issue with the modem itself, or there's something going on with the line that I'm not able to diagnose from here. I'm not seeing any issues on my end, but this persistent orange light usually indicates the modem isn't getting a signal from us.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Like, is it broken?

Agent: It could be, or it could be something external. Normally in a situation like this, I would recommend we send a technician out to do an on-site inspection. They can check the line, make sure all the connections are good, and if needed, replace the modem.

Customer: How long would that take? I need internet for work.

Agent: [inaudible] ...typically we can get someone out within the next business day, but let me check what availability looks like in your area. (typing sounds, pause) It looks like we have an opening tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... I mean, I guess that's okay, but I was hoping to get this fixed today.

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately, I don't have any same-day availability showing up for your area right now. But the good news is you should be back up and running by tomorrow afternoon. Can I go ahead and schedule that for you?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Fine. Tomorrow between 1 and 5.

Agent: Perfect. So I've got you down for tomorrow, the... (typing sounds) ...the 18th between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will come out and we'll get this all sorted for you. Is the number I have on file still the best way to reach you if they need to confirm?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Alright, Michael. I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. I know it's frustrating. But our tech team tomorrow should have you back up and running in no time. In the meantime, if anything changes or if you want to try anything else, feel free to give us a call back. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. Just hoping the tech can actually fix it tomorrow.

Agent: We'll do our best for you. Thanks for being so patient with me today, Michael. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
