Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and everything, and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick so we can get this sorted out for you. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got you here. I'm seeing an account for... is this at 824 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned the internet went out about an hour ago. Just to confirm—your modem is completely powered off right now, correct?

Customer: Yeah, I unplugged it about fifteen minutes ago. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug it back in for me. While that's powering up, can you tell me—do you have any lights on the modem at all right now?

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it in now. Um, let me see... the power light should come on in a second here...

Agent: No rush. Take your time.

Customer: Alright, yeah, I'm seeing the power light now. It's that white light on the left side?

Agent: Yes, exactly. And is it steady, or is it blinking?

Customer: It's... it's blinking. Like, on and off.

Agent: Okay, that's normal for startup. That should stabilize in about thirty seconds or so. While we wait for that, let me ask—have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time something like this has happened?

Customer: No, this is the first time. Internet's been solid until today.

Agent: Alright. And just to cover all the bases, you're not experiencing any storms or weather issues where you are, right?

Customer: No, no. It's actually nice out. Clear skies.

Agent: Good to know. Okay, so how's that power light looking now? Is it still blinking?

Customer: Yeah, still blinking. How long does it usually take?

Agent: It should be pretty much any second now. Sometimes it takes up to a minute depending on the model. While we're waiting, let me just check your account here... (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, which is good news. That tells me this might be something we can resolve on our end or with your equipment.

Customer: Okay... yeah, alright. (pause) Oh, I think I'm seeing something change. There's another light—it's green now.

Agent: Great! Which light is that? Is that next to the power light?

Customer: It's like... to the right of the power light. There's like three or four lights total.

Agent: Perfect. That should be your internet light, and green is what we want to see. Do you have a computer or phone nearby that you can try connecting to the WiFi?

Customer: Yeah, my laptop's right here. Let me see if I can... (pause) Hmm, no, I'm not seeing the WiFi network showing up.

Agent: Okay, that's odd. Let me check something on my end. One more thing—on the modem, do you see a light that might say WiFi, or is there like a WiFi symbol next to one of the lights?

Customer: Um... let me look closer. There's like a little curved symbol kind of thing... yeah, there's one there. But it's not lit up. That light is off.

Agent: Ah, okay. That could be the issue. Can you check if there's a WiFi button on the modem? Sometimes it's on the back or the side.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Let me flip it around here... yeah, yeah, I see a button that says WiFi on it.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and press that for me.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...pressing it now. (pause) Wait, is that supposed to do something? Nothing really happened.

Agent: Give it a few seconds. The light should come on.

Customer: (longer pause) Okay, I'm still... I don't see the light coming on. The WiFi light is still dark.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, let me try a different approach. Is there any chance the WiFi button is a toggle, and it's been turned off? Sometimes if someone bumps it or a kid touches it, it gets disabled.

Customer: Oh, I... I don't think so? But I don't know. Is there a way to turn it back on if it is off?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. You can press and hold that WiFi button for about ten seconds, and that should cycle it back on.

Customer: Alright, let me try that. (pause) Holding it... ten seconds, you said? (pause) Okay, holding it down... (longer pause) ...still holding... (pause) Alright, let it go.

Agent: Any change?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. The light's not on.

Agent: Okay, that's... that's interesting. (typing sounds) Let me look into something here. Can you tell me what model of modem you have? There should be a sticker on the bottom or back of it.

Customer: Um, sure. Let me look... it says... Frontier Gateway G1100. That's the model?

Agent: Yep, that's it. Alright, I'm pulling up the specs on that now. (pause) One thing we can try is a factory reset. That means we're going to restart the modem from scratch and reconfigure it. It should only take a few minutes.

Customer: Oh, okay. Will I lose my settings or anything?

Agent: You might lose your WiFi password settings, but we can reconfigure that pretty easily. The alternative is I can set up a technician visit to come take a look at the modem to see if there's a hardware issue. What would you prefer?

Customer: Let me try the reset first, I guess. I don't want to have to schedule something if we don't need to.

Agent: Smart. Alright, on the back of the modem, you should see a small recessed button labeled Reset. It usually requires a paperclip or something similar to press it.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, let me find a paperclip. (pause) Alright, got one. Found the reset button. So I just... press it?

Agent: Yes, but hold it in for about ten to fifteen seconds. The modem will restart, and you'll see the lights go off and come back on. Once all the lights are back and stable, give me a call and let me know how it looks.

Customer: Wait, do I stay on the line with you, or...?

Agent: You can just put me on hold for a couple minutes. I'll wait right here.

Customer: Okay, putting you on hold. (hold music plays briefly) Alright, I'm back. I held the button, and now the modem is doing that blinking thing again. All the lights went off.

Agent: Good, that's exactly what should happen. Let's give it another minute or so to fully restart. (pause) Okay, how's it looking now?

Customer: Um, the power light is solid again. Green internet light is on. But... the WiFi light is still off. Same as before.

Agent: Interesting. Okay, that WiFi light staying off even after the reset suggests there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself. It could be a problem with the WiFi radio component.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: Well, we can certainly get you a replacement modem sent out. We'd overnight it to you, and you'd just swap it out. I can also schedule a technician to come and do that in person if you'd prefer. Given that you don't have internet right now, I'd actually recommend the technician visit because they can come out today or tomorrow and get you back up and running immediately.

Customer: How long would that take? I'm working from home, and I kind of need the internet...

Agent: I understand completely. Let me check our tech availability right now. (typing sounds, pause) (typing sounds) So the earliest I'm seeing for your area is actually tomorrow morning between 8 AM and 12 PM. We could also do an afternoon slot around 2 to 6 PM if that works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning works. Can you do that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I've got a technician scheduled to come out to 824 Maple Street tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes. The technician will bring a replacement modem, install it, and get your internet and WiFi back up and running.

Customer: Okay, great. Um, so in the meantime, there's nothing else I can try?

Agent: Unfortunately, with the WiFi light not responding after the reset, it really does point to a hardware issue that needs to be replaced. I wouldn't want you to waste your time troubleshooting something that we'll have to replace anyway.

Customer: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Alright, well, thank you for trying.

Agent: Of course! I apologize that we couldn't get it working today, but we'll have you back online tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with before we hang up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow morning!

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
