Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um... my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried everything I can think of.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. I see you're on our Frontier Fiber service in the Riverside area. Okay, so the internet just went out about an hour ago, you said?

Customer: Yeah, right around 3 o'clock. One minute it was working fine and the next it just... nothing. No lights, no connection, nothing.

Agent: Alright, so we're getting nothing from the modem at all. Have you had a chance to restart it yet?

Customer: I mean, I unplugged it for like... thirty seconds? Is that... is that not enough?

Agent: Well, let's try giving it a bit longer this time. What I'd like you to do is unplug the modem from the power source, and then we'll wait about two minutes. That'll give it a full reset.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. So we're gonna let that just sit for a couple minutes here while I ask you a few questions. Have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, this is... this is the first time in like, six months that I've had any problems at all. Usually it's rock solid.

Agent: That's good to hear. And you mentioned no lights on the modem at all?

Customer: Right, nothing. The whole thing's dark.

Agent: Okay, um, just to confirm—your modem is plugged directly into the wall outlet, correct? Not into a power strip or anything like that?

Customer: No, it's... it's in the wall. Well, I mean, it was. It's unplugged right now obviously, but yeah, it's always been in the wall outlet.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, go ahead and plug that back in for me now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in... (pause) Okay, it's in.

Agent: Good. Give it about thirty seconds to boot up. You should start seeing some lights come on.

Customer: (pause) I'm... I'm looking at it. Um, nothing yet.

Agent: Nothing? Okay, let's give it another ten seconds or so. Sometimes these take a minute to fully power on.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing, Derek. This is... I don't like this.

Agent: I understand. Um, okay, let me ask you this—do you see any lights on the outlet itself? Like, is the outlet actually powered?

Customer: Oh! Oh wow, you know what? Let me... let me check. Hold on. (pause) Okay, so the outlet... I'm plugging in my phone charger. Yeah, the outlet works fine. The charger's charging.

Agent: Okay, good. So the outlet is live. Let's go ahead and plug the modem back in there.

Customer: I'm doing that now. (pause) Alright, it's plugged in again.

Agent: And now we're waiting for those lights to come on again. This should take about thirty to forty seconds.

Customer: (long pause) I'm watching it... I'm watching it... (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing something. There's a little green light, I think? Or maybe amber? It's hard to tell from where I'm sitting.

Agent: Okay, that's a good sign. What color would you say it is?

Customer: It's... it's amber, I think. Or yellow? One of those.

Agent: Amber is normal during the boot-up sequence. You should see that change to green once it's fully connected. How long has it been amber?

Customer: Um, maybe a minute? Minute and a half?

Agent: Okay, let's give it another minute or two. The initial startup can take a few minutes sometimes. In the meantime, let me check on our systems here to see if there are any service alerts or outages in your area. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any active outages reported, which is... actually a good sign. It means it's likely something with your equipment.

Customer: Okay, so... so it might just be the modem then?

Agent: Well, it could be the modem, or it could be the connection from outside. Let's not jump to conclusions yet. Is that light still amber?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's still amber.

Agent: How long has it been now total?

Customer: I don't know, maybe like three minutes? Four?

Agent: Alright, that's... that's longer than usual. Um, let me have you try something else. I want you to look for a small reset button on the back of the modem. It's usually recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something small. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking... I see it. It's like a tiny button back here?

Agent: That's the one. I'm going to have you hold that down for about ten seconds. This is going to do a factory reset on the modem.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...holding it down. (pause) Okay, the lights just went out.

Agent: That's normal. Go ahead and release it now.

Customer: (pause) Released. And now...?

Agent: Now we wait for it to boot back up again. This is essentially the same process as before, so give it a couple minutes.

Customer: (long pause) Derek, I gotta be honest, I'm not feeling great about this. How often does this happen? Like, do modems just die?

Agent: It's not super common, but it does happen. Could be a power surge, could be it's just reached the end of its life cycle. Modems usually last anywhere from three to seven years. How old is yours?

Customer: Um, I want to say... maybe four or five years? I'm not totally sure. You guys provided it when I signed up, so...

Agent: Okay, so it's definitely in the range where failure isn't out of the question. But let's see if this reset helps. Are you seeing any lights yet?

Customer: (pause) No, not yet. Still waiting. (pause) Still nothing.

Agent: [inaudible] ...still nothing, yeah. Um. Okay, let me try a different approach. I'm going to check our systems to see if your modem is registering on our network at all. (typing sounds) Hmm. Okay, so I'm not seeing your modem online. And I'm also not seeing any recent signal strength issues from the line itself, so...

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it means your modem likely isn't connecting to our network right now. That could be because it's not powering on properly, which would point to the modem itself. Or it could be a connection issue on the line that's preventing it from registering. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you check the cables? The one coming in from outside, and the one going into the modem?

Customer: Yeah, um, they look fine to me. They're both plugged in pretty tight.

Agent: Okay. And just to be thorough, the cable coming from outside—the one that comes from the wall—you're not seeing any damage or anything on it?

Customer: No, it looks fine. Just a regular coaxial cable.

Agent: Alright. And the modem itself—are you seeing any lights at all now?

Customer: (pause) No. Still nothing. Whatever that reset did, it seems to have just... turned it off.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Um. This is... this is unusual. Typically we'd see at least some activity. Let me see here... (typing sounds) I'm going to check if we have any technician visits in your area today that might give us some additional information. (pause) I'm also going to check your equipment history here... (pause) Alright, so your modem is still under our standard equipment coverage, which is good news. The challenge right now is that I'm not able to get it to respond through any of our troubleshooting steps, which... to be honest, it's pointing pretty clearly at the modem being the issue.

Customer: So I need a new modem?

Agent: Potentially, yes. What I'd like to do is schedule a technician to come out. They can verify that it's actually the modem and not something else, and if it is, they can swap it out for you.

Customer: How long would that take? When could they come?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) So we've got some slots open tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we also have a 12 to 5 PM window. We also have availability on Thursday morning, if neither of those work for you.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, tomorrow morning would work. The 8 to 12 slot.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm scheduling a technician visit for you tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. Your confirmation number is gonna be 847-XR-FRONTIER. Can you repeat that back for me just to make sure I got it right?

Customer: 847... XR... Frontier.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, there is a $99 service call fee if this ends up being a hardware issue that needs replacement. That fee will be waived if it's actually a line issue on our end, but given what we're seeing, I do want to set that expectation.

Customer: Okay, understood. So tomorrow morning, 8 to noon.

Agent: That's correct. The technician will have all your info, and they'll give you a call about thirty minutes before they arrive if you want to provide a cell phone number for that.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that's fine. It's 555-0149.

Agent: Great. And is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I mean, I guess I'm just stuck until tomorrow now.

Agent: I understand. I really do apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today. These situations are frustrating, but the good news is we'll have you back up and running very soon.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, bye.

Agent: Have a good day.
