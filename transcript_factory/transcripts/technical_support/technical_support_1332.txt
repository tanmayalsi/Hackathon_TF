Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm working from home, so this is kind of a big problem.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... hold on, let me find it. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. And your name?

Customer: It's James Corrigan.

Agent: Great, James. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Do you know approximately what time that happened?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 8 AM? Yeah, I got up, tried to log into my work laptop and... nothing. Just no connection at all.

Agent: Okay, and just to confirm—are you using our Frontier WiFi router, or do you have your own equipment?

Customer: No, I'm using the one you guys provided. The white box thing.

Agent: Got it. Alright, James, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Are there any lights on the router?

Customer: Um, yeah, there's... let me go look at it. (pause) Okay, so there's a power light that's green. But the internet light—I think it's supposed to be green too, right? That one's red.

Agent: Okay, that red light is actually telling us something. That typically means there's no internet signal coming into your modem. Have you tried restarting the router yet?

Customer: No, not yet. How do I do that?

Agent: Sure, it's really simple. Just unplug the power cable from the back of the router—the one that goes into the wall—and wait about 30 seconds. Then plug it back in and we'll wait for it to boot back up.

Customer: Okay, I'm doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. While we wait those 30 seconds, I'm just going to ask—have you had any recent storms in your area or any digging going on in your neighborhood?

Customer: No storms that I know of. Although, uh, there were some construction workers out front yesterday doing something with the street. But I don't think they did anything to my house or anything.

Agent: Interesting. That could potentially be related, but let's see if the restart helps first. Go ahead and plug that back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) It's starting up now. I see the lights coming on.

Agent: Great. Let's give it about a minute or so to fully boot up and establish a connection. That's usually enough time.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm looking at it... the power light is green, but the internet light is still red.

Agent: Hmm, still red. Okay, let me try something else. Can you check the cable that goes into the router? It should be a coaxial cable—kind of thick, with a metal connector on the end. Can you make sure that's plugged in snugly?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. (pause) It looks like it's... wait, actually, let me check. It doesn't look like it's completely tight. Let me... (grunt) okay, I'm tightening it.

Agent: Good thinking. Sometimes these can come a little loose. Let's give the router a moment to see if that helps.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it now. The power light is still green, but the internet light... still red.

Agent: Still not connecting, huh? Alright, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your account history here, James. I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, but I do see we had a service visit scheduled... (pause) oh, was there someone supposed to come out to your place yesterday?

Customer: What? No, not that I know of. Nobody came to my house. Should someone have?

Agent: Let me look into this a bit more. Give me just one second. (pause) Okay, I'm pulling up the work orders... I don't see anything there. That's odd. Um, let me try a different approach. Can you tell me what lights you have on the modem itself? Is there anything else besides the power and internet light?

Customer: There's a power light, an internet light, and then there's like... a WiFi light? I think? And then below that it just says "link" or something.

Agent: Perfect. What color is the link light?

Customer: It's... also red.

Agent: Red, okay. And the WiFi light?

Customer: That one's actually off. It's not lit up at all.

Agent: Alright, that tells me the modem isn't establishing any signal at all. Can you do me a favor and check where the cable enters your house? It should be coming in from outside. I know it's a bit of a hassle, but I want to make sure it wasn't damaged or disconnected.

Customer: (pause) Okay, hold on. Let me go look. I'm going outside right now. (background noise of door opening) Okay, I see... there's a cable coming in from the pole out there. Where does it connect?

Agent: It should connect to something called a Network Interface Device, or NID. It's usually a gray or white box on the outside of your house, probably near where the power lines come in.

Customer: Uh... yeah, I see a box. It's up there by the garage. (pause) The cable looks like it's... connected? It's plugged in. But now that I'm looking at it closer, I notice there's a second cable that doesn't look like it's connected to anything. It's just kind of... hanging there.

Agent: (pause) Can you describe that cable to me?

Customer: It's like a... it looks the same as the other one. It's a thick cable with the metal thing on the end. And it's definitely not plugged into anything.

Agent: Okay, I'm wondering if that might be the issue. Do you feel comfortable trying to connect that cable to the box?

Customer: Oh, um... yeah, I think so. I mean, where would it go?

Agent: There should be a port on the NID that looks like it would fit that cable. It might have a cap on it. Just try connecting it.

Customer: Okay, I'm... (grunting sounds) I'm trying... okay, I think it's... wait, is this right? It's getting tight. (strain) Okay, I think it's in. Let me... yeah, that's in.

Agent: Excellent. Go ahead and head back inside and let's see if that made a difference.

Customer: Okay, I'm heading back in. (background noise) Alright, I'm back. (pause) Looking at the router... the internet light is... still red.

Agent: (pause) It's still red?

Customer: Yeah. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Okay, um... let me check the line status on my end here. (typing sounds) (longer pause) Hmm. James, I'm seeing something unusual in our system. It looks like your line might not be properly provisioned. Have you been having any issues with your service recently? Any slowdowns or anything like that?

Customer: No, actually it's been working fine until this morning. It just completely stopped working all of a sudden.

Agent: Right. Okay, I want to try one more thing before we explore other options. Can you restart the modem again, but this time I want you to hold down the reset button for about 10 seconds while it's powered on.

Customer: Where's the reset button?

Agent: It should be a small button, probably recessed into the modem. You might need to use a paperclip or a pen to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. I'm pressing it now. (pause) It's restarting. All the lights went out and now they're coming back on. (pause) Okay, it's... it's booting up again. (longer pause) The power light is green, and the internet light is... (pause) ...still red.

Agent: Still no luck, huh?

Customer: No, nothing. It's the same.

Agent: Alright, James, I've tried several troubleshooting steps with you and unfortunately we're not getting that internet light to come on. At this point, I think what we're looking at is either an issue with the line itself or possibly a problem with the modem hardware. I have a couple of options for you. We can schedule a technician to come out to your house and diagnose the issue in person. 

Customer: How long would that take? I really need to get this working today. I have a meeting at 2 PM.

Agent: (pause) Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) Unfortunately, our next available appointment would be... (pause) ...tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That doesn't help me today. Isn't there anything else we can do?

Agent: I understand the frustration, James. Um... (pause) the other option would be to try replacing the modem. We could ship one out to you today and it might arrive tomorrow, but honestly, given the symptoms you're describing—the way the internet light isn't coming on at all—I suspect this might be a line issue rather than a modem issue. But I can certainly put in a request for a replacement unit if you'd like to try that as well.

Customer: So you're saying I probably won't be able to work today no matter what?

Agent: Based on what I'm seeing in the system and the troubleshooting we've done, I'm afraid that's looking likely. But let me escalate this to our technical team. Give me just a moment. (pause - longer hold music plays - pause) Okay, I've added a note to your account and I'm going to have our network team look at your line. They might be able to push a provisioning update that could resolve this. That could take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. In the meantime, would you like me to schedule that technician visit for tomorrow as a backup?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Do that. I guess I'll have to work from my phone or something.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get you scheduled. The appointment window is between 12 and 4 PM tomorrow. Does any particular time work better for you?

Customer: I'm flexible tomorrow. Just make it 1 PM or something in that range.

Agent: Perfect. I'm scheduling you for 1 PM tomorrow. You should receive a confirmation email shortly. Is the email on your account still current?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Great. And James, I apologize that we weren't able to get this resolved for you today. Our network team will be looking at your line, and if they're able to push through that update, your service might come back online within the next hour or so. The technician will definitely be able to diagnose the exact issue when they come out tomorrow.

Customer: Alright. I guess I'll just... wait and see then.

Agent: Yes, that's the best thing to do for now. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I don't think so. Just... hopefully this gets fixed soon.

Agent: I hope so too, James. Thank you for your patience, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. Have a good day.
