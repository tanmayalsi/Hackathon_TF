# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So my internet has been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I'm working from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got you here. So you mentioned your internet has been down since this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um, let me... (pause) Yeah, so the modem has a couple lights on it. I think the power light is on, but like, the internet light? That one's off. Or it's red. I'm not totally sure.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. The red light typically indicates there's no connection. Let's try a few things. First, can you do a hard restart? I'm going to need you to unplug the modem and the router—that's the box with the antennas—and just leave them unplugged for about thirty seconds.

Customer: Alright, give me one second. (pause) Yeah, I'm unplugging them now. Okay, they're both unplugged. (pause) Thirty seconds... alright, should be good.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first. That's the smaller box.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. There's a bunch of lights doing their thing. Should I plug the router back in now?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and plug the router back in as well. And then just give it about two minutes to fully boot up. Sometimes it takes a little bit for everything to sync up properly.

Customer: (pause) Okay, they're both plugged in now. I'm just... waiting. (pause) So what am I looking for? When it's working, what should the lights look like?

Agent: Good question. The modem should have a solid green light for the internet connection. You might also see lights for power and maybe a WiFi light depending on your model. Is the router wireless or wired?

Customer: It's wireless. I'm looking at it now and... the power light is green, but I'm still seeing a red light. Maybe orange? It's kind of hard to tell.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's not ideal. Let me ask you this—are you able to plug a computer directly into the modem with an ethernet cable? We can try that to see if it's a WiFi issue or a broader connection issue.

Customer: Yeah, I have a laptop. Let me grab a cable. (pause) (background noise of things shuffling) Okay, do you have one? I'm not seeing... I might have one somewhere. Hold on.

Agent: Take your time.

Customer: (pause) (inaudible) Okay, I found one. Plugging it in now. (pause) Let me go to... I'm opening a browser. I'm trying to load Google and... nothing. It's just loading and loading.

Agent: Okay, so the wired connection isn't working either. That tells me it's likely an issue with the modem itself or with the service coming into your home. Have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or has this happened before?

Customer: Not that I know of. This is the first time in like a year that we've had a problem. And I checked my phone earlier to see if other people were having issues and I didn't see anything on social media or anything.

Agent: Alright. Let me check our system to see if there are any known issues or maintenance in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any active outages in your zip code at the moment, but let me try one more thing. Can you check the back of your modem where the cables come in? I need you to see if the coaxial cable—that's the thick cable, kind of like a cable TV cable—is fully connected.

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I see it. (pause) It looks pretty snug. I can try tightening it though. (pause) Okay, I'm turning it a bit. Does that usually help?

Agent: It can, sometimes. Sometimes these connections get a little loose. Let me check the lights again after you've done that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I tightened it. Still seeing the red or orange light. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Unfortunately, it sounds like we might be dealing with a modem issue or possibly a service line issue that I'm not able to troubleshoot remotely. I think what we need to do is get a technician out to your location.

Customer: Oh man, really? How long is that going to take? Like I said, I work from home and I really need my internet back.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm showing our next available appointment window is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Really, there's nothing sooner? Like today?

Agent: Unfortunately, it looks like today is fully booked. I wish I had something available. Tomorrow morning is the earliest I can get someone out to you.

Customer: (sighs) I guess I don't have a choice. Yeah, okay, tomorrow between 8 and noon. Can you make sure they bring a new modem or something? I feel like this one might just be dead.

Agent: I'll make a note on your account that you may need a new modem. The technician will be able to diagnose the issue when they arrive. Let me get a callback number in case the technician needs to reach you.

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account.

Agent: Perfect. So to recap, you have an appointment tomorrow from 8 AM to 12 PM. A technician will come out, diagnose the issue, and hopefully get you back online. If they need to reach you, they'll call that number. Do you have any other questions for me?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. I'm not happy about waiting until tomorrow, but... I guess that's how it is. Thanks for at least trying.

Agent: I'm sorry we weren't able to resolve this over the phone, James. I know it's frustrating. A technician will definitely get you sorted out. We appreciate your business with Frontier, and we'll get you back online as soon as we can.

Customer: Alright. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
