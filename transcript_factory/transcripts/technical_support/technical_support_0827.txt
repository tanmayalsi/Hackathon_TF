Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I'm showing an account for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Robert. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. When exactly did you first notice it wasn't working?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 8 a.m.? I was trying to work from home and everything just... stopped. No warning or anything.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm, you're not getting any connection at all, or is it just really slow?

Customer: No connection. Like, there's nothing. My WiFi isn't showing up on my devices, and... I checked the router and, uh... (pause) ...the lights aren't doing what they normally do.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me walk you through a quick troubleshooting process. First, can you tell me what color the lights are on your router right now?

Customer: They're... mostly red? Or like, orange? And one of them is flickering. Usually they're all green.

Agent: Yeah, okay. That actually tells me something might be going on with the connection to our network. But let's not jump to conclusions. First thing I'd like you to do is unplug the router from the power outlet. Just pull the plug out.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Done.

Agent: Great. Now I'm going to have you wait about thirty seconds before plugging it back in. Just give it a moment to fully power down.

Customer: (pause) Alright... thirty seconds... yeah, okay. Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Good. And now we'll just let it boot back up. This usually takes about a minute or so. While we're waiting, Robert, have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, first time. The internet's been solid up until today. No problems at all.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me check our system real quick to see if there are any known outages in your area. (pause) I'm actually not seeing any reported outages on my end, so that's a good sign. It might be something specific to your setup. How are those lights looking now?

Customer: Um... still mostly red. Maybe a little less flickering, but... yeah, they're not green.

Agent: Alright. So that reset didn't do the trick. Let me try a couple other things. Can you check for me—is there a cable running from your router to a modem, or do you just have the one device?

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) ...yeah, there's a cable. The modem is in the other room. Do you want me to go check on it?

Agent: Yes, please. And when you get there, tell me what the lights look like on the modem.

Customer: (background noise of footsteps) Okay, I'm here. Let me see... the lights on this one are... (pause) ...they're all off. It's completely dark.

Agent: Okay, that's actually the issue right there. The modem needs to be powered on. Is it plugged in?

Customer: (pause) Oh, no, wait... it is plugged in. But like, now that I'm looking at it, the outlet might not be... (pause) ...let me check. No, the outlet is working. I can see another device plugged into the same outlet and it's fine.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me have you try unplugging the modem as well, and then plug it back in, just like we did with the router.

Customer: Sure. (pause) Unplugging now. (pause) Okay, waiting... and... plugging it back in.

Agent: Perfect. Give it about ninety seconds to boot up this time. Modems take a little longer than routers. While we wait, is the power cable definitely secure on both ends? Sometimes they can come loose.

Customer: (pause) Let me look... yeah, it looks secure to me. It's pretty tight.

Agent: Alright. And how's it looking now?

Customer: (pause) Still dark. Nothing. Like, it's not even trying to turn on. Should I... is there a power button or something?

Agent: There shouldn't be a power button on a standard modem, no. But let me ask—do you see any lights at all, even a faint one?

Customer: (pause) ...No. Completely black. This is weird.

Agent: Yeah, that is unusual. Okay, so the modem might be the issue here. Before we go any further, let me ask—have you had any storms or power surges in your area? Or has anything unusual happened to the equipment?

Customer: No storms. But now that you mention it, we did have a power outage yesterday. Just for a few minutes, but it happened.

Agent: (typing sounds) Ah, okay. That could definitely be it. Power surges can damage modems sometimes. Let me check your account to see if there's anything on my end I can do, but I have a feeling we might need to get you a replacement unit.

Customer: Really? How long will that take? I need my internet for work.

Agent: (typing) I can definitely get a replacement modem shipped out to you. Normally it takes about three to five business days, but let me see... (pause) ...actually, we might be able to do expedited shipping. Can you hold for just one moment while I check what options are available?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Thank you for holding, Robert. I've checked with my supervisor, and unfortunately, expedited shipping isn't available for your address at this time. But I can get a standard replacement out to you by... (typing) ...Thursday at the latest. Does that work?

Customer: (frustrated) Thursday? That's three days away. I really need this sooner. Can't you guys do anything faster?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Unfortunately, that's the quickest we can get it to you based on your location. However, let me try one more thing before we go down that route. Sometimes a modem that appears completely unresponsive just needs a hard reset. Let me have you hold down the reset button—it's usually a small button on the back or bottom of the modem—for about fifteen seconds.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm looking for it. Yeah, I see a little button here. (pause) Holding it down... fifteen seconds... (pause) ...okay, let go. Anything happening?

Agent: Let's give it a moment.

Customer: (pause) Nope. Still nothing. Dark.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Yeah, I think the modem took a hit from that power surge. That's unfortunately not something we can fix remotely. I'm going to go ahead and process that replacement for you.

Customer: Okay, but... is there anything I can do in the meantime? Like, do you have any suggestions, or am I just stuck without internet until Thursday?

Agent: (typing sounds) Well, you could try power cycling the entire system one more time, but honestly, with a dead modem, I don't think it's going to help. Some customers in your situation use their mobile phone hotspot as a temporary workaround if they have unlimited data on their phone plan.

Customer: Yeah, I guess I could try that. It's not ideal though.

Agent: I know, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me go ahead and get that replacement processed. You should receive a shipping confirmation email within the next hour or two. When it arrives, you can simply swap it out, and you should be back online right away.

Customer: Alright... I guess that's the best we can do. Can you at least make sure I'm not charged for those three days without service?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me check your account and see what I can do. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm going to add a service credit to your account for three days. It won't be a full refund, but it should help offset the inconvenience.

Customer: I appreciate that. Thanks.

Agent: Of course. So just to recap, Robert—the modem is appearing to have been damaged by the power surge yesterday. I'm shipping out a replacement today, and it should arrive by Thursday. You'll get a confirmation email, and once you receive it, just plug it in and swap it out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll just keep an eye out for that email.

Agent: Perfect. And if you have any other issues once you get the new modem, don't hesitate to give us a call back. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Okay, will do. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Robert. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your patience. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
