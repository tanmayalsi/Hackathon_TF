Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I work from home and I've got meetings all afternoon.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here so we can get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account here for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Robert. So your internet went down this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 AM. I was working on something and then just... nothing. The router's still on, the lights are doing their thing, but I can't get online.

Agent: Okay, let me ask you a few quick questions. When you say the lights are on, can you tell me what color they are? And are any of them blinking?

Customer: Um, yeah. There's... let me look here... there's a blue light that's solid, and then there's like a green light that's blinking on and off.

Agent: Okay, so the blue light is solid, the green is blinking. That's actually a good sign—that usually means it's trying to connect. Have you tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in?

Customer: No, I haven't actually. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, let's try that. Go ahead and unplug it, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. I'll wait here.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. I'm gonna count to thirty... (pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. While that's booting back up, let me just verify a couple things. Are you on the fiber line or the standard broadband?

Customer: I'm not sure. How would I know that?

Agent: It should be listed in your welcome materials or on your bill. But it's probably fiber if it's a newer installation.

Customer: (pause) I think it's fiber. We switched about a year ago and they said it was really fast.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, and you're not seeing any loose cables or anything unplugged on your end?

Customer: Let me check... (pause) No, everything looks plugged in. Everything looks fine physically.

Agent: Alright. Is your router back on now? Can you see if those lights have changed?

Customer: Yeah, it's back on. Um... it's the same as before. Blue light solid, green light blinking.

Agent: Okay, still blinking. That means it's still not fully connecting to the network. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any service interruptions in your area, so that's good. Let me see your ONT box—that's the white box, probably either in a closet or outside your house somewhere?

Customer: Oh, um, it's in the garage. Do I need to go look at it?

Agent: Yeah, if you could. I just want to see if that has lights too, and if they're all solid or if any are blinking.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm heading to the garage. (pause) I'm here. So I see the white box... there's a couple lights on it. Let me see... I got a green light that's solid, and a red light that's solid too.

Agent: Okay, you're saying you have a red light and a green light both solid?

Customer: Yeah, both solid. Is that bad?

Agent: (pause) Actually, that... the red light might indicate a potential issue. It could be a signal problem or a power issue. Let me ask—when was the last time you restarted that unit?

Customer: I don't know. I didn't even know I needed to restart it. I didn't touch it since we had it installed.

Agent: Okay, no worries. A lot of people don't. Let's try that. There should be a power button on the back or bottom of that ONT box. Try holding it down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking... yeah, I see the power button. Holding it down... (pause) Okay, I'm holding it. How long?

Agent: About ten more seconds should do it.

Customer: (pause) Alright, releasing it now. The lights just went out for a second and now... they're coming back on. Still have the red light though.

Agent: Still red?

Customer: Yeah, still red.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Okay, let me check your account for any notes about service issues. (typing sounds) When you say the red light came on, was that just today or...?

Customer: No, I don't know. I'm looking at it now for the first time in a while. This is the first time I've actually looked at the garage box since installation.

Agent: I understand. Let me run a line test from my end. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm not getting a strong signal on your line. The signal levels are pretty low. That could definitely explain why you're not connecting.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it on my end or on Frontier's end?

Agent: That's a great question. It could be either. If it's on your end, it might be an issue with the ONT box or the cabling. If it's on our end, it could be a line issue somewhere in the network. Given that red light, I'm thinking it might be a signal issue. Let me try something. Can you go back inside and check if the ethernet cable that's connected to your router—that's the yellow cable usually—is plugged in tight?

Customer: (background noise fading) Yeah, I'm back inside. (pause) I see it. It looks plugged in to me, but let me try unplugging it and plugging it back in.

Agent: Perfect.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. Still nothing. Still the same lights.

Agent: Yeah, I'm still not seeing the signal improve on my end. (pause) You know what, I think at this point we might need to send a technician out to take a look at your line. There could be something physical going on that I can't diagnose over the phone.

Customer: When would that be? Like I said, I really need internet. I have meetings this afternoon.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) Today's pretty booked, but... I might be able to get someone out there this evening between 5 and 8 PM. Would that work?

Customer: That's still pretty late, but I guess I'll have to make it work. Can't you do anything sooner?

Agent: I wish I could, Robert. I'm looking at the schedule and that's the earliest availability. Let me just double-check one more thing before we schedule. Can you restart your router one more time? Just to be absolutely thorough?

Customer: (sigh) Okay, I already did this once, but fine. (pause) Unplugging it again. (pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Alright, and your ONT box—just leave that as is since we just restarted it.

Customer: Okay... same thing. Still not working. Blue light blinking, nothing on the internet.

Agent: Alright, I think we've done all we can troubleshoot here. I'm going to schedule a technician visit for you. That'll be today between 5 and 8 PM. Is there anything else I should note for the technician? Like, are you renting the equipment or did you purchase it?

Customer: I think it's rented. You guys installed it.

Agent: Okay, good. And the red light is still on the ONT box right now?

Customer: Yeah, it's still there.

Agent: Perfect. I'll make a note of that. Your technician will be able to diagnose what's going on. You should get a confirmation text or email within the next hour with a more specific time window.

Customer: Okay. And if they can't fix it today, what happens then?

Agent: Well, they should be able to get to the root of it. But if for some reason they can't that same day, they'd schedule a follow-up. But let's not worry about that yet. Hopefully we'll have you back up and running this evening.

Customer: Alright, I guess that's better than nothing. Thank you, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Robert. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. We really appreciate your patience, and I'm sorry for the inconvenience with your meetings.

Customer: Yeah, well, hopefully this technician knows what they're doing.

Agent: I'm sure they will. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, Robert. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
