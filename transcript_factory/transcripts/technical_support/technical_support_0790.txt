Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it back up and running.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And your name?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your service here. So you mentioned the internet went down this morning? When exactly did you first notice it?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 8 or 8:30. I went to check my email and nothing was loading. Tried opening a few websites and... nothing.

Agent: Got it. And have you done any troubleshooting on your end yet? Like, have you tried restarting your modem and router?

Customer: No, I... I wasn't really sure where to start, to be honest. That might help?

Agent: Yeah, that's usually the first thing we try. It clears out any temporary issues. So what I'd like you to do is locate your modem and router. They're probably in the same area, maybe a closet or under a desk or something?

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I've got them here. They're in the living room by the TV.

Agent: Perfect. So go ahead and unplug the modem first—that's the larger box usually—and wait about 30 seconds, then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. Waiting... (longer pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) The lights are coming back on. There's a blue light and a couple of green ones.

Agent: Great. Now do the same thing with your router. Unplug it, wait 30 seconds, then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Got it, unplugging now. (pause) Alright, replugged. The lights are coming back up again.

Agent: Excellent. Give it about a minute or so for everything to fully boot back up. While we're waiting, let me just pull up your account details here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, which is good news. (pause) Okay, has it been about a minute?

Customer: Yeah, about that. So... should it be working now?

Agent: Let me have you try something. Can you open up a web browser on your computer or phone and try going to a website? Maybe Google or something simple?

Customer: (pause) Uh, yeah, I'm trying right now. (pause) No, still nothing. It's just... the page won't load.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check a few things here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages on our end, and your modem is showing as online in our system. That's a good sign. Um, do you have any other devices that you can try? Like a phone or tablet?

Customer: Yeah, let me grab my phone. (pause) Okay, I'm trying it now. (pause) Still nothing. It won't even connect to the Wi-Fi. Well, actually, it shows the network, but when I try to connect it's just... not working.

Agent: Alright, so the network is showing up, which means the router is broadcasting. But you're getting connection issues. That's interesting. Let me ask you—do you see any lights on your router right now?

Customer: Yeah, there's, uh, there's a couple of green lights on the front. I think there's one that's blinking?

Agent: (pause) Okay, and on the modem? Are all the lights lit up, or do you see any red lights?

Customer: (pause) Looking at the modem... I see blue and green. Don't see any red.

Agent: Good, good. So here's what I'd like to try next. We're gonna do a factory reset on the router to clear out any configuration issues. To do this, there should be a small reset button on the back of the router. It might be recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something similar to press it.

Customer: (pause) A reset button? Um, yeah, I think I see it. Let me grab something to press it with. (pause) Okay, I'm pressing it. (pause) Oh, okay, the lights just went crazy for a second.

Agent: That's normal. It's restarting. Let me have you wait about two minutes for it to fully reset and restart this time.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, I'm watching it now. (pause) The lights are doing their thing. They're kind of cycling through. (pause) Okay, now it seems like they're settled. We good?

Agent: Let me try one more thing here. Can you look at the Ethernet cable that goes from your modem to your router? Make sure it's plugged in securely on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it. It looks... it looks pretty secure? It's definitely in there.

Agent: Alright. Try your phone again now. See if you can connect to the Wi-Fi.

Customer: (pause) Still not... no, it's still not working. It's not even showing the network name now. That's weird.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Um, can you see if there's a Wi-Fi button on the router? Sometimes there's a physical button that can turn it off.

Customer: (pause) There's a button here that says... it looks like it might be an on-off switch? It's got, like, a Wi-Fi symbol on it.

Agent: Yeah, that might be it. Try pressing that and see if the Wi-Fi comes back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, pressing it. (pause) Oh, actually, now I see the network name appearing on my phone again. Let me try connecting... (pause) No, it's asking for a password, but when I enter it, it still won't connect.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so the network is back, but you're having authentication issues. Let me check something on your account here. (typing sounds, longer pause) You know what, James, I'm a little puzzled here. Everything on our end looks like it should be working. Your modem is online, we're not seeing any service issues...

Customer: So what does that mean? Is something wrong with my equipment or...?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be a configuration issue with your router that a factory reset should have fixed, but apparently it didn't. It could also be something with the modem itself, or there might be a line issue we're not detecting yet. (pause) What I'd like to do is get a technician out to your place to take a look at everything in person. They can run some diagnostics and see what's actually going on.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet today if possible.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. (pause) The earliest I'm showing is tomorrow afternoon. We have a slot between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? (pause) I mean, I guess that'll have to work. It's not ideal, but... what else can I do?

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. What I'll do is schedule that technician visit for you tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM window. Our tech will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive. They should be able to get everything up and running.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Schedule that for me.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it all set up. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details. Is the email on your account current?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I think so. It should be.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap, James, we've tried restarting your equipment, factory reset the router, and verified that everything should be working on our end. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get the connection re-established, so a technician will be out to your place tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM to diagnose the issue further.

Customer: Alright, I got it. Thanks, I guess. I mean, I appreciate you trying to help me out at least.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone today. I know how frustrating this is. But I'm confident our technician will get you sorted out tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it. I'll just wait for the tech tomorrow.

Agent: Sounds good, James. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
