Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet has been down since this morning and I'm really frustrated because I need it for work. I've been without service for like... I don't know, six hours now?

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be, especially when you're trying to work. Let me pull up your account here and we can get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Thank you. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have there been any recent storms in your area, or did anything unusual happen before it stopped working?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I just... I woke up, tried to use it, and nothing. No lights on the modem, nothing. It's just completely dead.

Agent: Okay, and just to clarify—the modem itself, you're not seeing any lights at all? Not even a power light?

Customer: Right, nothing. It's like it's not even on.

Agent: Got it. So first thing, let's check if there's a power issue. Can you walk over to where your modem is right now?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I'm heading there now. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it.

Agent: Alright. Is the power cable plugged in securely on both ends? Like, check where it goes into the modem and where it goes into the wall outlet.

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, it looks plugged in. Both sides look good.

Agent: Perfect. And the outlet itself—do you have anything else plugged into it that's working? Like a lamp or something?

Customer: Oh, good idea. Let me try... (pause) Yeah, actually I have a lamp here. Let me plug it in. (pause) Okay, the lamp is on, so the outlet is working.

Agent: Great, that's good information. So the power outlet is fine. Let's try unplugging the modem for about thirty seconds. Can you do that?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Alright, I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Perfect. Just... while you're waiting, I'll let you know that we actually did have some service notifications in your area yesterday. There was some maintenance work happening, but that should've been completed by this morning.

Customer: Oh, really? So that could be it?

Agent: It's possible. Let's see if a power cycle helps. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) I don't see any lights yet.

Agent: It might take a moment to boot up. Can you just... give it about sixty seconds? Sometimes they're a little slow to start.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... still nothing. I'm looking at it and there's just... there's nothing. No lights at all. Shouldn't there be at least a power light or something?

Agent: Yeah, normally there should be. So it sounds like the modem itself might not be turning on. That's unusual. Um, let me ask you this—the power cable, can you double-check that it's the one that came with your modem? Sometimes people accidentally use the wrong cable.

Customer: (pause) I mean, it's the only cable I have for it. I don't know if it's the original one or not. I've had this modem for like... two years, maybe?

Agent: Okay, okay. Well, that could potentially be the issue. Unfortunately, I'm not able to diagnose a hardware problem like that over the phone with absolute certainty. What I can do is send you a replacement modem at no charge, and you should receive it within about five to seven business days.

Customer: Five to seven days? (frustrated) I can't wait that long. I need internet for work. Can't someone come out here? Is there an option for expedited shipping or something?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me check what options we have. (typing sounds) Unfortunately, expedited shipping isn't available for modems sent as replacements. However, I can look into scheduling a technician visit. That would be faster. Let me see... (pause) The earliest I'm seeing is Thursday of next week. Would that work for you?

Customer: Thursday? That's still four days away. Isn't there anything sooner?

Agent: I'm looking at the schedule right now, and unfortunately, that's the earliest availability we have in your area. But before we go down that route, let me try one more thing. Let me just verify our network on my end. (typing sounds) 

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) Alright, the network looks good on our end. Your service should be active. Hmm. Can you tell me—is there a cable going from your modem to your router? Or do you have a combined unit?

Customer: Yeah, I have a router too. It's separate. Do you want me to check that?

Agent: Actually, yes. Let me make sure that cable is secure. Can you... can you follow the cable from the modem to the router?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the modem isn't turning on, so even if the router was disconnected, that wouldn't matter, right?

Agent: You're right, you're right. That's a good point. (pause) Okay, so we're back to the modem being the issue. Let me—I want to try one more thing before we schedule anything. Can you try a different outlet? Like, maybe in a different room?

Customer: Really? You think that's going to help if the lamp is working in this outlet?

Agent: I know it seems unlikely, but sometimes there can be surge protection or other issues that cause problems, and it's a pretty simple thing to try.

Customer: (sighing) Alright, give me a second. (pause, footsteps) I'm going to the kitchen. (pause) Okay, plugging it into this outlet. (long pause) No, still nothing. Same thing—no lights, no power.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I think at this point we're looking at a hardware issue with the modem itself. I'm going to go ahead and process a replacement modem for you, and I'll also see if I can expedite it in the system. I also want to check if there's any way to get you a temporary solution or possibly move your appointment up.

Customer: Can you actually do that?

Agent: Let me put you on a brief hold while I talk to my supervisor about this. It'll just be a minute or two.

Customer: Okay. (hold music plays for about 45 seconds)

Agent: Alright, David, thanks for holding. So I spoke with my supervisor and unfortunately we can't move the technician appointment up any sooner than Thursday. However, what I can do is apply a credit to your account for the days you're without service, and I can mark your replacement modem as urgent priority so you should get it within two to three business days instead of five to seven.

Customer: Okay, I guess that's better. But I still don't have internet for the rest of this week and probably into next week.

Agent: I completely understand. This is frustrating. I do want to ask—do you have any other way to access internet? Like through a mobile phone or anything? I know it's not ideal for work, but just in case.

Customer: Yeah, I have mobile data, but it's not great for what I do. I'm a designer and I need a reliable connection to upload and download large files. This is really not ideal.

Agent: Yeah, I hear you. And I'm sorry we can't get this resolved faster today. What I'll do is I'll send the replacement modem to you with expedited shipping noted, and you should receive it within three days. If you don't receive it by then, please call us back and we'll follow up. The credit for your service will appear on your next bill. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I guess not. When exactly will it be shipped? And what's the tracking number?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so it's going to be shipped out tomorrow morning, and you'll receive an email with the tracking information within the next 24 hours. The email will come from our shipping partner, so make sure to check your spam folder if you don't see it right away.

Customer: Alright, well, I guess I'll just have to make do with my phone for now. This is really inconvenient.

Agent: I completely understand, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We really appreciate your patience, and hopefully we'll have you back up and running very soon. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Alright, David. Thank you for calling Frontier, and sorry again that we couldn't get this resolved immediately. You have a great day.

Customer: Yeah, you too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
