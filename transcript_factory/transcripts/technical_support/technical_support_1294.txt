# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll do our best to get you back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got you here. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning—can you tell me a little more about what's happening? Are you getting any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually. The modem has a red light on it. That's the problem, right? Is that... I don't know what that means.

Agent: Okay, red light can mean a few different things. Let me walk you through some troubleshooting steps. First, I want you to unplug the modem for me—just pull the power cable out completely.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Can you leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds? While we wait, do you have a router as well, or just the modem?

Customer: I have both. They're sitting right next to each other.

Agent: Perfect. And is the router also powered on right now?

Customer: Yeah, it's still on. Should I unplug that too?

Agent: Go ahead and unplug that one as well, but wait about 30 seconds with both unplugged before you plug the modem back in first.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Alright, it's been like 30 seconds I think. Plugging the modem back in now.

Agent: Excellent. Now let's give that about a minute to boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me if you've had any storms or anything recently? Sometimes that can affect the equipment.

Customer: (pause) No, nothing like that. We had some rain yesterday but nothing crazy. (pause) Okay, so the modem is booting up. I see some lights flashing.

Agent: Good, that's normal. You should see the lights stop flashing after a minute or so, and then you should have a solid green light or maybe a blue light, depending on your model.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm seeing... I've got a green light now. That's good, right?

Agent: That's very good! That means your modem is connecting. Now go ahead and plug your router back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, it's back on. Let me just... (pause) Hmm, it's still not working though. Like, I'm not getting internet.

Agent: Alright, let's check a few things. Can you tell me the model number on your modem? It should be on a sticker on the back or bottom.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking... I see... it says "Frontier 5268AC."

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And on your router, what's the model there?

Customer: It's a... (pause) TP-Link. One of their models. It says ARCHER-C80 on it.

Agent: Alright. So the modem lights are green now, but you're still not seeing internet on your devices?

Customer: Right, yeah. I'm not connecting to WiFi or anything. My laptop won't... it's just not working.

Agent: Okay, let me check something on the backend here. (typing sounds) Hmm, David, I'm not seeing any issues with your line from our end. Let me ask you this—when you look at the modem, aside from the green light, are there any other lights? Sometimes there's a specific internet light.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, actually, I think I see... there's like an orange light on the bottom. Is that bad?

Agent: That could be the issue, actually. An orange light typically means the modem isn't syncing properly with our network. Let me try something. I'm going to send a refresh signal to your modem right now. This should take just a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I see the modem lights flickering now.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give that about two minutes to process. While we wait, have you noticed any physical damage to the modem? Any signs of water damage or anything like that?

Customer: No, it looks fine to me. It's been sitting on my bookshelf, totally dry and everything.

Agent: Good. And when was the last time your internet was working normally?

Customer: It was working fine last night. I was streaming and everything. Then this morning when I woke up, it just wasn't working.

Agent: (pause) Okay, give me one second. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm checking the line status here... David, I'm seeing that there might be an issue with the connection on our side. Did you recently have any service work done at your home?

Customer: No, nothing recent. I mean, I don't think so. The install was like... I've had service for two years now.

Agent: Okay, just checking. So the lights on the modem right now—what are you seeing?

Customer: (pause) The green light is still there, but the orange one is still on too. It didn't change.

Agent: Alright, let me try a hard reset on the modem. This will take a bit longer. Do you see a small reset button on the back of the modem? It's usually recessed.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think I see it. It's really tiny.

Agent: That's the one. I want you to hold that down for about 15 seconds while the modem is powered on. You might need a paperclip or something small to press it.

Customer: Oh, okay. (pause) I'm grabbing a paperclip. (pause) Okay, holding it down now. (pause) One... two... (pause) Alright, I'm at like 15 seconds. Can I let go?

Agent: Go ahead and let go. The modem should restart. This is going to take a few minutes, so we'll just wait while that happens.

Customer: (pause) It's restarting. Lights are flashing again. (pause) Okay, it's coming back up. (pause) Still have the green light... and the orange light is still there too.

Agent: (pause) I see. Okay, David, let me be honest with you here. That orange light shouldn't be staying on, and typically that indicates either a line issue on our end or potentially an issue with the modem itself. Let me check our system one more time. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any active alerts on your line, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's no problem. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to your location to do an in-person diagnostic.

Customer: Oh no, how long would that take? I really need my internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm looking at our technician schedule, and the earliest I can get someone out would be tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? That's... yeah, I guess that works, but I really needed it today.

Agent: I know, and I apologize for that. Unfortunately, this seems like something that needs hands-on troubleshooting at your location. Our technicians are more equipped to test the line and potentially replace the modem if that's the issue.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, yeah, tomorrow is fine then. What do I need to do?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home during that window. A technician will come by between 8 and noon. They'll have all the tools they need. In the meantime, if you want to try anything else, you could check that all the cable connections are seated firmly—just make sure they're snug at both the wall and the modem.

Customer: Okay, I'll give that a shot. So someone will definitely be here tomorrow?

Agent: Yes, they will. Let me confirm your address just to be sure we have the right location. (typing sounds) 447 Maple Street, Apartment 3B?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And just to recap, this is a service call for internet not working due to a potential modem issue. We'll send that over to our technician team right now. Do you have a cell phone number where we can reach you if the technician needs to confirm anything?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0298.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, I'm adding that to the appointment. Alright, David, you should receive a confirmation email shortly, and the technician may call you tomorrow morning before they arrive. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: We'll get this taken care of for you. I really appreciate your patience, and I apologize that we couldn't resolve it remotely today. If you have any other questions before tomorrow, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Okay, will do. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome, David. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
