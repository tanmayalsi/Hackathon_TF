Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I work from home and I've got meetings coming up.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... uh, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm looking at your account now. And just to confirm, I'm showing this is for the service at 2841 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So when you say the internet went down this morning, do you have any lights on the modem right now? Are you looking at it?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually I'm looking at it now. So, the power light is on, but I don't see the internet light. Like, it's not lit up at all.

Agent: Okay, okay, that's helpful. That tells me something. So the internet light not being on typically means the modem isn't detecting a signal. Let me ask you a couple quick questions. First, can you check if all the cables are plugged in? Sometimes these things get bumped or knocked loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me... (background noise) Okay, so I'm looking at the back here. The power cable is plugged in, and there's... it looks like there's an ethernet cable going to my router, and then there's another cable coming in from the wall. That one looks pretty secure to me.

Agent: Good. And the one coming in from the wall—that's what we call the coaxial cable. Can you try unplugging it and plugging it back in? Just give it a solid click.

Customer: Okay, I'm doing that now. (pause) Alright, it's back in. (pause) Hmm, still no light.

Agent: Still nothing, okay. Let me have you try a power cycle. Go ahead and unplug the power cable from the modem, and then wait about 30 seconds, and plug it back in.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Should I wait the full 30 seconds?

Agent: Yeah, give it the full 30 seconds. That helps reset everything.

Customer: Alright, I'm counting... (long pause) Okay, 30 seconds are up. Plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's back on. I see the power light... (pause) ...waiting for it to boot up. Sometimes it takes a minute.

Agent: You're doing great. Just give it another 15 or 20 seconds or so.

Customer: (pause) Okay... okay I'm seeing some lights now. There's the power light, and there's like an... activity light that's blinking. But the internet light... (pause) ...no, it's still not on.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's... (pause) that's not quite what I was hoping for. Let me pull up your account here and see if there's anything showing on our end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me... have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. I mean, I've had the service for like three years now and it's been pretty solid.

Agent: That's good to know. Okay, so I'm not seeing any outages in your area or anything on our systems that would indicate a problem on our side. (pause) Let me ask you this—do you have a secondary line or a mobile phone you could try using to see if there's like a backup router or anything?

Customer: What do you mean? Like... I don't have another router or anything.

Agent: No, I just meant... sometimes customers have a backup device. But that's not the issue here anyway. Okay, so let me try something else. Can you do me a favor and check the signal strength? On the back of your modem, there should be some indicator lights, or actually, do you have the model number? That's usually on the front or back somewhere.

Customer: (background noise, rustling) Okay, I'm looking... I see a sticker here. It says... MB8621.

Agent: Okay, MB8621, that's a good unit. Alright, can you locate the coaxial cable again—the one coming in from the wall?

Customer: Yeah, I see it.

Agent: Okay, and is it hand-tight or does it look like it's... does it need to be tightened at all?

Customer: (pause) It feels pretty tight. I mean, I don't think... I don't know. It feels okay to me.

Agent: Right. Try tightening it a bit more, but not too hard. You don't want to strip the threads.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I tightened it a little more. (pause) Still... nothing's changed, though.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Let me try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem again, and this time I want you to unplug the coaxial cable as well. Just leave everything off for about 60 seconds.

Customer: Okay, unplugging both. (pause) Done. I'm waiting now... (long pause) Okay, 60 seconds. Plugging everything back in. Power first. (pause) And the coaxial... (pause) Okay, everything's in.

Agent: Alright, give it about 30 seconds to boot up.

Customer: (pause) Okay... the power light's on... activity light is blinking... (pause) but... no. The internet light is still not coming on.

Agent: (sighs) Okay, I'm not going to lie to you—that's... that's not looking good. I think at this point we might be dealing with a hardware issue, either with the modem itself or possibly something on the line side that I can't detect from here. (typing sounds) Let me see what I can do for you. I can absolutely schedule a technician to come out and do a full diagnostic. They're really going to be able to see what's going on.

Customer: How long would that take? Because like I said, I really need this working today if possible.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check availability. (typing sounds) So, unfortunately, we're not looking at anything until tomorrow. The earliest I can get someone out there is... it looks like tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or later in the afternoon between 4 and 6 PM.

Customer: (pause) Wow, really? There's nothing today?

Agent: I wish I had better news. I know this is frustrating. But given that we've done all the troubleshooting steps and the modem still isn't responding, this really does need to be looked at by a technician on the ground. They might be able to either repair it or swap it out for you.

Customer: Alright... I guess tomorrow morning would work. I mean, I'll just have to call into my meetings from my phone or something.

Agent: I'm sorry about that. Let me get you scheduled. So that's tomorrow, let me put you down for the 8 to 12 PM window. I'll need to confirm your phone number for the technician to call when they're on their way.

Customer: Okay, it's 555-0268.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, you're all set. Confirmation number is 847392. The technician will call you in the morning before they head over. They'll have a replacement modem with them just in case, so hopefully we can get you back up and running pretty quickly once they arrive.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I mean, I'm not happy about waiting, but... I guess it's better than nothing.

Agent: I really do apologize for the inconvenience today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll just... yeah, I'll wait for the technician tomorrow.

Agent: Sounds good. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't get this fixed over the phone. We'll get you taken care of tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye.

Customer: Bye.
