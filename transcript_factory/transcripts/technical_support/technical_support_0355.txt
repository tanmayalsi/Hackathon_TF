Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that now. I see the account is under... David Martinez?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Alright, David. So your internet went down this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Um, let me go look at it real quick. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. The modem has... it looks like just a red light blinking on the top. Is that bad?

Agent: The red light typically indicates there's a connection issue. Let's try some basic troubleshooting first. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull it out of the power outlet.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And while we're at it, do you have a separate router, or is it all in one unit?

Customer: No, I've got a separate WiFi router. It's connected to the modem with an ethernet cable.

Agent: Perfect. Can you unplug that as well?

Customer: (pause) Done. How long do I wait?

Agent: About thirty seconds should do it. Let's give it... another ten seconds or so. Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's back in. Should I wait for something to happen?

Agent: Yeah, you should see some lights come on. Give it about a minute to boot up. While we're waiting, had you experienced any storms last night or anything unusual?

Customer: No, actually it was pretty clear. It just... stopped working when I woke up this morning.

Agent: Okay. And this is the first time something like this has happened?

Customer: Well, I had an outage maybe six months ago, but I think that was on your end. This feels different though.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check if there are any outages in your area... (pause) No, I'm not showing any active outages on our end right now. So, what are you seeing on the modem now?

Customer: Uh, the lights are on but... the red light is still blinking. The same red light from before.

Agent: Okay, and is there a light that shows... usually there's an internet or globe icon that should be solid green or blue?

Customer: (pause) I see a globe thing, yeah, but it's... I think it's red too? Or maybe orange? It's hard to tell with this lighting.

Agent: That's the internet connection light. That definitely shouldn't be red. Let me have you plug in the router now.

Customer: (pause) It's plugged in.

Agent: Good. Now, can you check the ethernet cable that connects the modem to the router? Is it plugged in on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks like it. It's pretty snug in both places.

Agent: Alright. Sometimes these cables can come loose. Can you try unplugging it and plugging it back in? Just to reseat it?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Okay, I just did that. (pause) Nothing's changed though. The lights are still the same.

Agent: I understand. Let me ask you this—do you have any devices connected to the WiFi right now that might be showing that there's internet?

Customer: My phone's connected to it, but there's no internet. I can see the WiFi network name, but I can't load anything. And my wife tried her laptop too, same thing.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let me try a few more things here. Can you restart your modem one more time? And this time, let's also do a full factory reset on the router.

Customer: (hesitant) A factory reset? Will that... like, erase everything?

Agent: It'll reset the WiFi password, so you'll need to reconnect your devices, but it shouldn't affect anything else. Let's see if that helps. Go ahead and unplug the modem again.

Customer: (pause) It's unplugged. And I'm looking for the reset button on the router... do I just hold it?

Agent: Yeah, there's usually a small recessed button. You'll need to hold it for about ten seconds with a paperclip or pen.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see it. I'm holding it now. (pause) Still holding it... and... okay, I let go. The lights are all blinking now.

Agent: Good, that's what should happen. Now plug the modem back in and let's wait for everything to come back online.

Customer: (pause) Modem's plugged in. (long pause) Okay, the lights are coming back on but... (pause) The internet light is still not green. It's still red.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) David, I'm not showing any issues with your connection on the line itself. The modem should be provisioned correctly. (pause) When was the last time you restarted the modem before today?

Customer: I don't know, maybe a week or two ago? I usually just leave it on.

Agent: That's pretty normal. This is a bit puzzling because the equipment on our end shows everything looks good. (pause) Have you checked the coaxial cable? That's the thick cable that comes into the modem from the wall?

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) I'm looking at it. It's pretty dusty back there but it looks connected.

Agent: Can you try gently wiggling it, just to make sure it's seated properly? Sometimes they can look connected but not actually be all the way in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm twisting it a little bit... still not working though.

Agent: Alright, I'm going to be honest with you, David. I'm not seeing anything obvious on my end that would cause this, and the standard troubleshooting steps aren't bringing the connection back. This might be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or there could be a line issue that our remote diagnostics aren't picking up on.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, how long will it take to fix?

Agent: Well, we have a couple of options. I can schedule a technician to come out to your location and physically check the line and equipment. Or, if you think it might be a hardware issue, we could send you a replacement modem.

Customer: (pause) How long for a technician?

Agent: Let me check the availability. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm showing we have availability on... Thursday or Friday of next week. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Next week? That's like five days away. I need internet before then.

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately, that's what we have available in your area right now. If you want, I can email you a replacement modem, and it should arrive in two to three business days. You could try that while you wait for the technician.

Customer: (frustrated) I don't understand how this just stopped working. Is there anything else we can try right now?

Agent: (pause) Let me... let me escalate this to our technical team real quick. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent: (hold music plays for about 45 seconds)

Agent: Thank you for holding. I spoke with our senior technician and he suggested we try one more thing. He wants us to check if there's a battery backup on your modem. Sometimes if that gets into a fault state, it can cause these kinds of issues.

Customer: (pause) I don't think mine has a battery. It's just the modem.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. (pause) At this point, David, I think we've exhausted the troubleshooting steps I can do remotely. The symptoms you're describing—the red internet light that won't come up—suggest either a hardware failure on the modem side or possibly a line issue that requires on-site diagnosis.

Customer: (sighs) Alright, so I'm without internet for the rest of the week basically.

Agent: I know this is frustrating. Here's what I'm going to do. Let me get you scheduled for that technician visit on Thursday, and I'll also email you a replacement modem today. You should receive a shipping notification within a couple hours. When the modem arrives, you can try swapping it out, and hopefully that'll get you back online before the technician visit.

Customer: Okay, I guess that's something. What's the email for the replacement modem? And I need to know the exact time the technician is coming.

Agent: (typing sounds) The modem will be shipped to the email address on your account, which I'm showing as... [inaudible] @gmail.com. Is that still correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. And for the technician, I'm scheduling you for Thursday, December 14th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. Someone will need to be home to let them in. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, I guess I can make that happen.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all of this information within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. I just really hope the replacement modem works because I can't be without internet all week.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll get this figured out one way or another. If the replacement modem doesn't resolve the issue when it arrives, you can give us a call back and we can potentially move the technician appointment up. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yeah, alright. Thank you for trying, anyway.

Agent: You're welcome, David. I apologize again for the inconvenience. Your confirmation email should be in your inbox shortly. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you Thursday.

Customer: Okay, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
