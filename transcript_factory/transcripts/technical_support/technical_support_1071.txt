# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging things but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. Account for... Robert Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing an outage this morning. When exactly did you first notice the internet went down?

Customer: I'd say around 6:30 or so? I went to check my email and nothing was loading.

Agent: Alright. And before it went down, was everything working normally?

Customer: Yeah, totally normal. I was streaming a show last night, no problems at all.

Agent: Got it. Okay, so let's start with some basic troubleshooting. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your gateway right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) okay, let me look at it. It's, uh... the power light is green, and... the internet light is red. Is that bad?

Agent: The red light on the internet indicates there's no connection, so that's what we need to fix. Can you do me a favor and unplug the gateway for about thirty seconds? Just pull the power cord right out of the back.

Customer: Sure, unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugging... and... (pause) thirty seconds... alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Give it about a minute to fully boot back up and tell me what the lights look like now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the power light is green again... but the internet light is still red.

Agent: Still red, okay. And do you see any other lights, like maybe a yellow or orange light anywhere?

Customer: No, just the green and the red. Oh, wait, there's like a little white light on the side but I think that's always been there.

Agent: That's probably the WiFi indicator, so that's fine. Alright, let's check your modem. Do you have a separate modem or are you using the gateway as both?

Customer: I think it's all in one? It's just the one box.

Agent: Perfect, that's the gateway then. Okay, can you check—is there an Ethernet cable plugged into the back of the gateway? Like a white cable?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see one. It goes to the wall.

Agent: Okay, good. And can you see if there's a coaxial cable? That's a thicker cable with like a metal connector on the end?

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) I think so? There's definitely something plugged in back here. It's... yeah, looks like that.

Agent: Good. And is that one secure? Can you gently tug on it?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's pretty tight. Seems like it's in there good.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else. Can you do a factory reset on the gateway? There should be a small button, might be recessed—

Customer: Oh, no, I don't want to do a factory reset. Won't that erase everything?

Agent: It will reset the gateway back to default settings, but it shouldn't erase anything permanently. Your internet settings will be restored automatically. But I understand if you're concerned. Let's try a couple other things first.

Customer: Okay, yeah, let's do that then.

Agent: Perfect. So let me check here... (typing sounds) I'm looking at your account and I'm not seeing any service outages reported in your area at the moment. Let me check your line status. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays for about 20 seconds)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So I'm seeing that the line is registered but the connection is inactive. That's unusual. Let me ask you this—have you had any storms in your area recently? Any power outages?

Customer: Um, not that I'm aware of. I mean, everything else in my house is working fine. The power was on the whole time.

Agent: Right, right. Okay, let me try to restart your line from our end. (typing sounds) Give me just a second here... (pause) Okay, I've sent a restart command. Let's give that about two minutes to process and then we can check on those lights again.

Customer: Okay. (pause) So I just wait?

Agent: Yeah, just give it a moment. While we're waiting, have you noticed anything else unusual? Any sounds or anything?

Customer: No, it's just sitting there. The lights are the same—green and red.

Agent: Alright. Let's give it about another minute... (pause) Go ahead and check those lights again for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay... still green and red. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, let me pull up your modem signal levels real quick. (typing sounds, pause) I'm looking at your downstream and upstream levels and they're actually pretty good on our end, so the issue isn't with signal quality. 

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it means we're reaching your equipment, but your gateway isn't responding properly. This could be a hardware issue or it could be a provisioning issue. Let me try one more thing. Can you check—is there a label on the back of the gateway with a MAC address? It should start with numbers or letters.

Customer: (pause) I see a bunch of stickers but... I'm not really sure which one you're talking about. There's like... model numbers and stuff.

Agent: It might say "MAC" on it. Do you see that?

Customer: I... don't think so? This is getting pretty technical for me.

Agent: No problem, I understand. Okay, actually, let me ask you—when was the last time you've had any work done on your line? Any technician visits recently?

Customer: Not that I remember. I've had the internet for like... three or four years now? And I don't think anyone's been here.

Agent: Okay. And you're not aware of anything that might have happened this morning before the internet went out? Any power surges, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing that I'm aware of.

Agent: Alright. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I've run through all of our remote troubleshooting options and unfortunately, I'm not able to get your connection back online from my end. I think we might have a hardware issue with your gateway or possibly an issue with the line itself that we need to have a technician look at in person.

Customer: Oh, so I need a technician to come out?

Agent: Yeah, I think that's going to be our best bet here. But the good news is we can usually get someone out within a couple of days. Let me check our availability... (typing sounds, pause) I can schedule a technician visit for you. Would tomorrow or Friday work better?

Customer: Tomorrow would be great, actually. I need to get online.

Agent: Understood. Let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I have an appointment available tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. So to summarize, I've sent a technician appointment to your account for tomorrow morning, 8 AM to 12 PM. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue with your gateway or line. In the meantime, just leave your gateway as is.

Customer: Alright, thank you. I really need my internet back, so I appreciate the help.

Agent: Of course, I know this is frustrating. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome, Robert. Thanks for choosing Frontier and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, bye.

Agent: Take care, have a great day.
