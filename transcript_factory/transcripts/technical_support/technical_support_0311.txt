# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Marcus. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I'm supposed to be working from home today and I can't do anything without internet.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this resolved. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's area code 407, 555-0142.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, I'm showing a Marcus Reynolds at that number. Is that you?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you done anything to troubleshoot yet, or is this the first time you're reaching out?

Customer: Um, I tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in, like the usual thing, but that didn't help. The modem lights are... I mean, some of them are on, but like, not all of them?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Which lights are on right now? So on the modem itself, what color are they and which ones are lit up?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so there's a green light on the left side, but the internet light, I think? That one's not on. It's just... dark. And then there's like a power light that's on.

Agent: Alright, so if I'm understanding correctly, you've got power on and that green light you mentioned is probably the status light. But the internet connection light isn't illuminated. That typically indicates we're not getting a signal to your modem.

Customer: Right, yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Perfect. Let me pull up your service details here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any outages in your area at the moment, so that's good news. Before we dig deeper, can you tell me... when's the last time your internet was working normally?

Customer: Yesterday evening. I was using it fine and then I went to bed and when I woke up this morning it was just gone.

Agent: Got it. And you haven't had any storms or power outages or anything like that overnight?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of, no. I mean, we might have had a storm, I was sleeping, but... I don't think there was anything major.

Agent: Understood. So here's what I want to do. I'm going to walk you through a few troubleshooting steps. First, can you locate your modem for me? Where is it?

Customer: It's on my desk, actually. It's sitting right in front of me.

Agent: Perfect, that makes this easier. So I want you to unplug the modem from the power outlet, but before you do that, can you also see if there's an Ethernet cable running from the modem to anything?

Customer: Um, yeah, there's a cable going into the back of it.

Agent: Okay, leave that connected. Just pull the power cable out of the wall socket.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now I want you to wait about 30 seconds. While we wait, I can tell you what we're doing here. Sometimes the modem gets into a state where it needs a full reset to reconnect to our network. This should help clear that out.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

Agent: (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged back in. How long until... like, when should something happen?

Agent: Give it about two minutes. You should see the lights start to cycle through different colors, and then eventually that internet light you mentioned should turn green. Let me stay on the line with you while we wait for that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so they're starting to flash now. There's like a blue light that's... moving?

Agent: That's the boot-up sequence. That's exactly what we want to see. Just give it another minute or so.

Customer: (longer pause) Uh, okay, so now the lights have settled down. They're all kind of steady now. Green and blue. But that internet light... it's still not on.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm, that's not ideal. Can you see the blue light? Where exactly is that on the modem?

Customer: It's like, in the middle, I think? There's the power light on the left which is green, then kind of in the center there's this blue light that's on, and then... nothing else.

Agent: Alright, so the blue light would be your WiFi indicator, which is good. But the internet light should be... you know what, can you tell me the brand and model of the modem you're looking at?

Customer: Uh, (pause) it says... let me see... Frontier... and then it says "Gateway G2110." Is that what you need?

Agent: Perfect, that's exactly what I need. Thank you. So on that model, the internet light should be the third light from the left, and it should be green when you have an active connection. Since it's not lighting up, what we're likely dealing with is either a service issue on our end or possibly a problem with the connection coming into your home.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: Well, let's try one more thing before we escalate this. I'm going to check something on my end here. (pause, typing sounds) I'm going to do a remote reset on your modem. This might take a minute and your lights might do some funky things. Just bear with me.

Customer: Okay, I'm ready.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, initiating that now. You should see the modem kind of restart itself.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks like it's doing the thing again. The lights are flashing.

Agent: Perfect. Now we wait again. This reset is a bit more thorough than the manual one we did, so it might take a couple minutes.

Customer: (pause) ...Is there anything I need to do?

Agent: Just watch the modem and let me know when those lights settle down again.

Customer: (longer pause) Okay... okay, they're settling down. We're back to where we were. Green, blue, and that third light is still not on.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I was afraid of that. Let me check something on the network side. (typing sounds, pause) Interesting. So I'm looking at the connection logs and it looks like your modem registered on our network early this morning, but then it dropped the connection about an hour ago. That's when your service went down.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it something I did?

Agent: No, this typically isn't something you would have caused. What this suggests is that either there's a signal issue coming into your home from our network infrastructure, or there might be something wrong with the modem itself. Since the manual and remote resets didn't restore the connection, I'm leaning toward the signal issue.

Customer: Can you... can you fix that?

Agent: (pause) That's a great question. Unfortunately, diagnosing and repairing signal issues requires one of our field technicians to come out to your location. They'd need to check the line coming into your home and test the signal strength at various points. I can definitely schedule that for you, but I do want to exhaust one more option first. Do you have a smartphone or mobile device nearby that can connect to WiFi?

Customer: Yeah, I have my phone right here.

Agent: Can you try connecting to your WiFi network? Your router should be... well, I assume it's the same device or nearby?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm going to try. Okay, I can see the network. It's showing up. Let me try connecting to it. (pause) Okay, it's asking for the password. (typing sounds, pause) Connected! But like, there's no internet, right? Like, it says I'm connected but there's no internet symbol?

Agent: Right, that's what we'd expect in this situation. You've got WiFi signal from the modem, but the modem itself isn't receiving the internet signal from us. So the WiFi is working, but there's no data coming through.

Customer: Okay, so... what now?

Agent: (pause) Alright, so at this point I've exhausted the basic troubleshooting steps I can do from here. What I need to do is get a technician out to your home to check the physical line connection and test the signal. How does that sound?

Customer: I mean, how long before someone can come out? I really need internet today if possible.

Agent: I totally understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so for your area today we have an opening between 12 and 4 PM. That would be about... two hours from now. Or we have another slot tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Wait, you have someone who can come today? That would be better. Let me do the 12 to 4 window.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I have a technician assigned for you today between 12 PM and 4 PM at your address on file. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes with the technician's information and a phone number you can call if you need to reach them.

Customer: Okay, great. Um, is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: Honestly, I wouldn't recommend doing anything else with the modem at this point. Just leave it as is. When the technician arrives, they'll have better diagnostic equipment and they can run their own tests. They might need to replace the modem or repair the external line, or it could be something else entirely, but they'll be able to figure it out on-site.

Customer: Alright, well, I appreciate your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome! And again, I'm sorry you're dealing with this today. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll just wait for the technician.

Agent: Perfect. Your confirmation details should be coming through shortly. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll get your internet back up and running today. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
