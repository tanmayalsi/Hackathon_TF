Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet went down this morning and I've been without service for like... I don't know, three hours now? And I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's David Martinez.

Agent: Perfect. All right, David, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're on our Gigabit fiber plan. And when did you first notice the internet wasn't working?

Customer: Like I said, this morning around 8 o'clock. I tried to check my email and nothing was loading. At first I thought maybe my computer was being slow, but then I checked my phone and... nothing. The WiFi isn't even showing up.

Agent: Okay. And have you tried unplugging your modem and router yet? Sometimes a quick restart can get things back online for us.

Customer: No, not yet. Where are they? I'm not really... I mean, I'm not super technical with this stuff.

Agent: No problem at all. So your modem should be a box, probably about the size of a textbook, and it'll have cables plugged into it. It might be in a closet, under the TV, somewhere like that. Do you see anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I see it. It's under my entertainment center here. There's a bunch of cables and stuff.

Agent: Great. So what I need you to do is unplug the power cable from the back of that modem. Just give that about thirty seconds while it's unplugged, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging now. (pause) All right, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about thirty seconds. (pause) You can count it out if you'd like, or just wait a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I think that's thirty seconds. Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. And while that's booting back up, do you see a router near there as well? That might be a smaller device, could be black or white, and it'll have antennas on it.

Customer: Oh yeah, I see that. There's a little white box with two antennas.

Agent: That's the one. Once the modem finishes restarting, we'll restart that as well. The modem should have some lights on the front. Are any of those lights on right now?

Customer: (pause) Uh, yeah. There's a couple lights. They were blinking before, but now they're... hmm, one is solid and one's blinking.

Agent: Okay, so it's coming back up. Let's give it another minute to fully boot up. Sometimes it takes a little bit.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah. It's been about a minute. Should I do the same thing with the router?

Agent: Yes, please. Go ahead and unplug that white box for about thirty seconds as well.

Customer: Okay. (pause) It's unplugged. (pause) All right, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. While that's booting back up, let me ask you a few questions. Have there been any recent storms in your area? Or have you noticed any damage to the line coming into your house?

Customer: No, no storms that I can see. It's actually pretty clear out today. And I haven't seen anything weird with the lines or anything.

Agent: Okay, that's good. And just to confirm, you're not seeing any lights on your modem or router now, or are you seeing some activity?

Customer: (pause) The modem lights are on now. They're both... one's orange and one's green. Is that normal?

Agent: So the orange light typically means it's still connecting. We want to see both lights green. Let me have you check on the router as well.

Customer: Okay, um, the router... yeah, the lights on it are green.

Agent: Great. So the router is good. Let's give the modem another minute or so to fully stabilize. The orange light should turn green. Is it still orange?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, still orange. It's been like a minute already.

Agent: Okay, let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) All right, David, I'm checking the connection status on your account. Hmm, it's showing that we are detecting your modem, but it looks like there might be an issue with the connection itself. Let me run a quick diagnostic. This should just take a minute.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Is that bad?

Agent: Well, we're not sure yet. Let's see what the diagnostic shows us. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so the diagnostic is complete. It looks like there might be an issue with the signal coming into your modem from our end. Have you noticed any damage to the cable outside? Like near where it enters your house?

Customer: I... I don't really know where the cable enters. I haven't looked outside or anything.

Agent: No problem. If you're able to, you could take a quick look at the exterior of your house where the cables come in. Usually it's on the side or back of the house. But while you do that, let me try something else. I'm going to reset your modem remotely to see if that helps. There'll be a button on the back that's going to get pressed.

Customer: Oh, okay. (pause) Wait, what do I need to do?

Agent: Just... actually, you don't need to do anything. I'm going to do it from here. Give me just one second. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, resetting now. You might see the lights flicker on your modem in a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I see them flashing. They're all flashing now.

Agent: Perfect. That's what we want to see. That means the reset is happening. Let's give it about two minutes to fully reboot and reconnect.

Customer: (pause) All right. (pause) So, um, should I check outside for that cable you mentioned?

Agent: Yeah, if you have a moment, that would be helpful. Just take a look around the exterior of your house, especially near where cables or lines enter the house. Just looking for any visible damage or anything that looks out of place.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause) I'm going to put the phone down for a second.

Agent: No problem, take your time.

Customer: (long pause) (background noise - door opening) Okay, I'm back. I'm looking around but I don't see anything obviously wrong. I mean, there are some cables coming into the house over there, but they look fine to me.

Agent: Okay, that's good. Well, that rules out any visible damage at least. Let me check the modem status again. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm still seeing that orange light situation we talked about. Um, the reset didn't seem to clear it up. Let me try one more thing here. Have you had any power outages recently in your area?

Customer: No, not that I've seen. Why does that matter?

Agent: Well, sometimes if there's been a power surge or an outage, it can affect the modem. It's just... it's one of the things we check. Okay, so let me try a factory reset on your modem. This is a bit more involved than what we did before. I'm going to need you to hold down the reset button on the back of your modem for about fifteen seconds. It's a small button, usually recessed in a little hole.

Customer: Oh, um... okay. Let me look. (pause) I'm seeing a button here, but it's really small. Do I need like a paperclip or something?

Agent: Actually, yes, that would help. A paperclip would work perfectly. Just straighten it out a bit so you can press the button.

Customer: Okay, let me find a paperclip. (pause) Hold on. (long pause) (background noise) Okay, I got one. And I'm pressing this little button now. How long did you say?

Agent: About fifteen seconds. Just hold it in and count to fifteen.

Customer: (pause) One, two, three... (pause) ...thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. Okay, I'm letting go.

Agent: Good. The modem should restart now, and it's going to take a few minutes. This will basically reset it back to factory settings, so we might need to reconfigure some things after.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so it's restarting?

Agent: Yes, it should be. Give it about three to five minutes.

Customer: (pause) All right, we're waiting. (long pause) Okay, so while we wait... is this something that's happening to a lot of people? Like, is there an outage in my area?

Agent: That's a good question. Let me check that for you. (typing sounds) (pause) No, I'm not showing any service outages in your area. Your neighborhood is showing good service status.

Customer: Hmm. That's weird then, right? I mean, why would my internet just stop working if everything else is fine?

Agent: Well, there could be a few things. It could be an issue specific to your modem, or it could be something with the line coming into your house. Sometimes those issues are hard to pinpoint remotely. (pause) Let me check the status on your modem now. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm still seeing that connection issue. The modem went through the reset, but I'm still not getting a solid connection from my end.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is my modem broken or something?

Agent: It's possible. Or it could be a line issue that we need to have a technician look at. Um, let me try one more diagnostic here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm running another test. (long pause) (typing sounds) All right, so based on what I'm seeing, there is definitely something preventing the connection from being established. Given that we've tried the restarts and the factory reset, I think at this point we're going to need to get a technician out to your location to look at this in person.

Customer: Oh, no. How long is that going to take? I need my internet for work. I've got emails I need to send out today.

Agent: I completely understand how urgent that is. Let me see what appointments we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) Let me pull up our scheduling system here. (pause) All right, so I can get a technician to you... it looks like we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or later tomorrow between 2 PM and 6 PM. Or we have Thursday morning available as well.

Customer: Tomorrow? Really? Can't anyone come out today?

Agent: Unfortunately, I'm not showing any same-day appointments available right now. We're pretty booked up today. But tomorrow morning would get you back online pretty quickly.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I guess I'll have to do tomorrow morning. Let me see... yeah, tomorrow morning works.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. So that's tomorrow, between 8 AM and 12 PM. You'll need to make sure someone is home to let the technician in. And just to set expectations, the technician will likely bring a replacement modem if needed, or they might find it's an issue with the line.

Customer: Okay. And I'll get my internet back tomorrow?

Agent: That's the goal, yes. Once the technician assesses the situation, they should be able to get it resolved. They'll either replace the modem or repair the line, depending on what the issue is.

Customer: Okay, well... I guess that's the best I can do. So what do I need to do between now and then?

Agent: Well, you can try to leave everything plugged in and powered on so I can continue monitoring from my end. And if by some chance your internet comes back on its own, that's great. But most likely the technician will need to address this tomorrow.

Customer: All right. So tomorrow morning. What time should I expect them?

Agent: Between 8 AM and 12 PM. They'll have your phone number and they can call you to let you know when they're on their way. Is the phone number on your account the best way to reach you?

Customer: Um, yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Great. So you're all set for tomorrow morning. You'll see a confirmation email coming to the email address on your account with all the details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I don't think so. I'm just... I'm frustrated that I can't get this working today, but I appreciate you trying.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. But our technician tomorrow should definitely get you back online. If you have any other issues before they arrive, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Okay, will do. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome, David. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see you tomorrow morning. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
