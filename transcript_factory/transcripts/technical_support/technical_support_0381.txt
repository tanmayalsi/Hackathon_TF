Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out completely. Like, I've got nothing. I've been without service for about an hour now and I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll see what we can figure out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And your name?

Customer: It's Michael. Michael Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got your account open here. So you're saying your internet connection is completely down as of about an hour ago, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I wasn't doing anything unusual or anything. I was just working from home and then all of a sudden everything just stopped. My computer's showing no connection at all.

Agent: Alright, let's walk through some troubleshooting steps. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is your modem powered on? Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Yeah, um... (pause) Let me go look at it. Hold on.

Agent: Sure thing.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. The power light is on, it's green. But the internet light... the one that's usually blue? It's not on at all. It's completely dark.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So we're getting power to the modem, but it's not connecting to the internet. Let's do a quick reboot. Can you unplug the modem from the power source for about thirty seconds?

Customer: Yeah, I can do that. (sound of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Let's wait about thirty seconds... (pause) ...and go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's just give it a minute or so to boot back up. While that's happening, can you also check your router? Do you see lights on that as well?

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's got some lights. I mean, it's got the power light on. But now that I think about it, I'm not sure if the internet light on the router is on either. I might be confusing which light is which, to be honest.

Agent: (chuckles) No worries, that happens all the time. Um, just to confirm—do you have a separate modem and router, or is it a combo unit?

Customer: It's separate. They're two different boxes.

Agent: Okay, good. And do you remember which one is which?

Customer: Yeah, the modem's the one I just rebooted. The router is the smaller one next to it.

Agent: Perfect. So on the modem—the one you just rebooted—are you seeing that internet light come back on now?

Customer: (pause) Hmm, no. It's still... it's still dark. That's not good, right?

Agent: Let's not worry yet. Sometimes it takes a little longer. Let's give it another twenty seconds or so. (pause) Is there anything else unusual you noticed? Like, did you have any storms or power outages recently?

Customer: Not that I know of. The power's been fine. Nothing weird happened.

Agent: Alright. How about now? Any change on that internet light?

Customer: (pause) No, it's still not coming on. This is... I mean, this isn't normal, is it?

Agent: Well, it could be a few different things. Sometimes the modem needs a little more time. But let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a line test here to see if we're seeing a signal coming from our equipment to your location.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (pause) Okay, so... (pause) Hmm. I'm not seeing an active signal on the line right now. That could mean a few things. It could be an issue with the modem, or it could potentially be an issue with the line itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it something I did?

Agent: No, no. This isn't anything you did. Let me try one more thing. Can you check the cables connected to your modem? Just verify that the coaxial cable—that's the one that comes in from the wall—is screwed in tight?

Customer: (rustling sounds) Yeah, I'm looking at it. It... it looks pretty tight to me. It's connected.

Agent: Okay, and can you follow that cable and see where it comes in from the wall? Is it coming from a wall outlet or a box on the outside of your home?

Customer: It's coming from a box outside. It's got the Frontier logo on it.

Agent: Good, that's what we expect. Um, have you noticed any damage to that cable at all? Any cuts or anything?

Customer: (pause) Not that I can see, no.

Agent: Alright. And have you tried power-cycling the router as well?

Customer: I haven't yet. Should I?

Agent: Yeah, let's try that. Go ahead and unplug the router—the smaller one—for about thirty seconds, just like we did with the modem.

Customer: (unplugging sounds) Okay, unplugging now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Let's wait... (pause) ...and go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (plugging sounds) It's back in.

Agent: Alright, let's give that a minute to boot up. (pause) While we're waiting, I do want to be upfront with you—the fact that the modem isn't picking up a signal on our end is concerning. It could indicate a service issue in your area, or it could be a problem with the modem itself. But let's see if the router reboot helps at all.

Customer: And if it doesn't?

Agent: Well, if it doesn't come back, we have a couple of options. One option is to have a technician come out and take a look at everything—the modem, the line, the external box. They could diagnose the issue more thoroughly. Or, if it's the modem that's bad, we could arrange to have a replacement sent out to you.

Customer: How long would either of those take?

Agent: For a technician visit, we'd typically have someone available within twenty-four to forty-eight hours, depending on availability in your area. For a replacement modem, that would typically ship out tomorrow and arrive within three to five business days. But... (pause) I'm still hoping we might get you back up here.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, so... is the router light on now?

Agent: Oh, good question. Can you check that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the power light is on. But the internet light... no, it's still not on.

Agent: Okay. (pause, typing sounds) Yeah, I'm still not seeing a signal on our end either, Michael. I hate to say it, but this is looking like it's beyond what we can troubleshoot over the phone. It's either an issue with the external equipment or a service disruption that I'm not able to see from my system.

Customer: So you're saying you can't fix this right now?

Agent: Unfortunately, not from here, no. I really wish I could. But I want to make sure we get this resolved for you properly. I'd like to set up a technician visit for you. Do you have availability tomorrow or the day after?

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, I guess so. Tomorrow would be better if you have it.

Agent: Let me check what we have available. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I can get a technician out to you tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Perfect. So we'll have someone there tomorrow morning. They'll take a look at everything and figure out what's going on. In the meantime, just leave everything powered on so they can see the current state of things when they arrive. And if you have any questions before then, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Alright. I really hope they can get this sorted out quickly. I've got work deadlines coming up.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll get this taken care of for you. Is there anything else I can help with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, Michael. Thank you for calling Frontier. We'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.
