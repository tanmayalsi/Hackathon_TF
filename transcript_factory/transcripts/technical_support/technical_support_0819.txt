# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got some work I need to do and I'm kind of stuck here.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I also get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got you here. I'm showing you're on our Fiber 500 plan at your address on Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router that might look unusual? Any red lights or anything that's changed?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) Yeah, so the modem, it's got that red light on the top and it's just kind of blinking. I don't think I've ever seen it do that before.

Agent: Okay, that red light is actually something we can work with. That usually indicates there's a connection issue between your modem and our network. Let's try a few basic steps first. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Sure, doing that now. (pause) Yep, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Go ahead and wait about thirty seconds... just let it sit there for a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Perfect. Now plug it back in and let's see what happens. Can you watch those lights and tell me what you see as it boots back up?

Customer: Okay, plugging it in... (pause) The lights are... they're doing that startup thing, you know, blinking a bunch... and now there's a white light... and... (pause) ...and it's still red. It's still red, Derek. Still got that red light.

Agent: Alright, that's okay. We've got a few more things to try. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any service outages in your area right now, so that's good news. Tell me, Michael—when did you last restart your router? The separate device, not the modem.

Customer: Oh, the router... I'm not even sure, honestly. Maybe a couple months ago?

Agent: No problem. Let's restart that as well. Do you have a separate router or is it all built into one device?

Customer: No, I've got the separate one. It's the Frontier box you guys provided.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and unplug that for me as well. Same process—thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugged. (pause) Thirty seconds... (pause) Plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. And while that's coming back online, let me ask you a couple more questions. Have there been any storms in your area recently? Or any changes to your setup?

Customer: No, no storms. The weather's been pretty clear actually. And no, nothing changed. I mean, I wasn't touching anything when it just... died.

Agent: Okay, just checking. Sometimes weather can affect the fiber connection. So the router should be booted back up now. Are you seeing any change on that modem? Is the light still red?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, still red. I'm looking at it right now and... yeah, still red.

Agent: Hmm. Let me look into this a bit more. (typing sounds) I'm going to check the status of your line here... (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your modem is registered on the network, which is interesting because that red light usually means it's not connecting. Let me ask—can you try connecting a device directly to the modem with an ethernet cable? Just to see if you can get any connection that way?

Customer: Um... (pause) I can try. Do you have an ethernet cable?

Agent: Most computers come with one, or they might be in a drawer somewhere. It's just a cable with the little plastic connectors on each end.

Customer: Right, yeah, I know what you mean. Let me look... (pause) I've got one here. Okay, I'm plugging it into the modem and then into my laptop.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and let me know if you're getting any connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking... no, nothing. The internet icon on my computer is still showing no connection.

Agent: Alright. (pause) That tells me the issue is definitely on the modem side, not your router or Wi-Fi. Michael, I think we might be looking at a hardware issue with your modem itself. That red light combined with what you're describing... it's typically a sign that the device isn't communicating properly with our network.

Customer: Oh, so the modem's broken? What does that mean for me? How long does it take to get a new one?

Agent: (pause) Let me just try one more thing before we go down that road. Sometimes a full power cycle of everything works. I'm going to have you unplug the modem, the router, and actually—do you have a battery backup unit or anything like that?

Customer: I don't think so, no.

Agent: Okay, just the modem and router then. Unplug both of them and wait for a full minute this time. A full sixty seconds.

Customer: Alright, both unplugged. Starting the timer... (pause) This is so frustrating, man. I really need to get this working today.

Agent: I completely understand. We're going to get to the bottom of this. (pause) Okay, how much longer on that minute?

Customer: Just about thirty more seconds...

Agent: Okay, let me check your account for any other information while we wait. (typing sounds) Have you noticed any issues before today, or was this completely out of the blue?

Customer: No, nothing. It was working fine this morning. I was using it fine, and then I just... nothing. Like someone flipped a switch.

Agent: Okay, that definitely suggests something changed on our end or with the modem. Alright, go ahead and plug everything back in—modem first, then the router.

Customer: (pause) Plugging in the modem... (pause) Okay, modem's in. Now the router... there we go.

Agent: Good. Let's give them about a minute to fully boot up this time. I know this is frustrating, Michael.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I appreciate you trying to help. It's just... not looking good, is it?

Agent: Well, let's see. Give it another few seconds... okay, what are you seeing on that modem now?

Customer: (pause) Still... still red. It's still that red light.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I hate to say it, but I think we've exhausted the basic troubleshooting steps here. The fact that the light isn't changing and you're not getting any connection through an ethernet cable tells me this is likely a modem hardware failure or possibly an issue on the line side that I can't diagnose remotely.

Customer: So what's my option? Can you send me a new modem or...?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I can set up a replacement modem for you. But I do need to let you know that we typically have a 3-to-5 business day window for delivery, depending on your location. Given that it's Wednesday, you'd be looking at early next week.

Customer: (pause) Three to five days? That's... I really can't wait that long. Is there any way to expedite it?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so we do have expedited shipping available, but that would be an additional charge of $49.99. It would get it to you by Friday.

Customer: (pause) How much did you say?

Agent: Forty-nine ninety-nine.

Customer: Ugh... can't you guys just... I don't know, send it for free? I'm a paying customer.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Michael. Typically, modem replacements are covered under your service, but expedited shipping is an additional fee. However, let me see if there's anything I can do. (typing sounds) (pause) I can reduce that to $24.99 as a one-time courtesy adjustment if you'd like to move forward with the expedited option.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I... yeah, fine. Let's do that. When would it arrive?

Agent: Great, thank you. That would be Friday by 5 PM at the latest. I'm going to place this order now. (typing sounds) Perfect. You should receive a tracking email within the next hour. When the modem arrives, just follow the setup instructions and if you have any issues, don't hesitate to call us back.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I will. So Friday... that means I'm without internet until then?

Agent: I'm afraid so. I wish there were something else I could do remotely. The good news is that Friday isn't too far away.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, alright. I guess I'll make it work. Thanks for trying anyway, Derek.

Agent: I appreciate your patience, Michael, and I'm sorry we couldn't get this fixed over the phone. You've got that modem coming Friday. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Just... hopefully this one works when it gets here.

Agent: It will. And if for any reason you have issues setting it up or anything else, please don't hesitate to reach out. We really do appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: Thank you, Michael. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
