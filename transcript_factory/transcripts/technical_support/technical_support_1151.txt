Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And just to confirm, this is for the address on file at 2341 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet went down this morning. Did anything happen before it went down? Like a storm, or did you restart your router recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I was just using it normally and then... I don't know, it just stopped working. One minute I'm streaming and the next minute, nothing.

Agent: Okay. Well, let me start with the basics. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Like, is the modem powered on? Are there any lights on it?

Customer: Um, yeah. Yeah, it's powered on. I can see... let me look at it... there's a green light on the front, and then... I think there's a red one next to it?

Agent: Alright, so you've got a green light and a red light. That red light is actually indicating that there's no internet connection. That's what we need to fix. Have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in?

Customer: No, I... I didn't think of that, to be honest.

Agent: No worries. Go ahead and do that for me now. Just unplug it from the wall, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, waiting... (pause) ...and plugging it back in. (pause) It's booting up.

Agent: Good. This usually takes about two to three minutes for it to fully connect. While we're waiting, let me ask—do you have a separate WiFi router, or are you using the modem's built-in WiFi?

Customer: Uh, I think it's built-in. I just have the one box.

Agent: Okay, so that's the Frontier-provided unit. Got it. (typing sounds) So your service is normally working fine, and this is the first time you've had this issue?

Customer: Yeah, this is the first time in the... I don't know, several months I've had it. Usually it's pretty solid.

Agent: Great. And how's that modem looking now? Are you seeing the lights change at all?

Customer: Yeah, actually. The red light's gone and now there's... um... it looks like there's a couple different lights blinking now.

Agent: Perfect. That's a good sign. Can you try connecting to the WiFi network on your device? It should show up as "Frontier" followed by some numbers.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at my laptop. Yeah, I see it. "Frontier-4829." Let me try to connect to it.

Agent: Go ahead.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's asking for the password. The password should be on the bottom of the modem, right?

Agent: Exactly. It should be printed on the sticker on the bottom of the device.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. Entering it now... (pause) Okay, it says it's connected. But... I'm trying to open a website and it's not loading.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. It's connected to the WiFi but you're not getting internet. That's interesting. Let me check on our end real quick. (typing sounds) Can you give me one moment?

Customer: Sure, yeah, no problem.

Agent: (pause) Thank you for waiting. Okay, I'm looking at your modem connection here and... I'm not seeing an active internet connection on the line. So the issue is actually coming from the service side, not the device.

Customer: Oh, so... what does that mean?

Agent: It means the signal isn't making it to your modem from our network. A few things could cause that—could be the line outside, could be a connection issue somewhere on the infrastructure. Let me have you try one more thing. Let me walk you through a factory reset of the modem. That'll clear out any settings that might be interfering. Do you see a small button—probably recessed—on the back of the modem?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...I think I do? It's really small?

Agent: That's the one. I need you to use something like a paperclip to hold that button down for about ten to fifteen seconds. The modem will restart completely.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause) Got a paperclip. (pause) Holding it... and... (pause) The lights just went off. They're coming back on now.

Agent: Good. Let's give this about three minutes to fully boot up again. While we wait, can I grab your email address? Just in case we need to follow up on this.

Customer: Yeah, it's [inaudible]@gmail.com. That's D-A-V-I-D-M-4-7.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. Okay, how are we looking now?

Customer: (pause) Same thing. Green lights, and then there's... I'm not seeing that red light now, but nothing's actually working. When I try to go to a website, it just times out.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Yeah, I'm still not seeing an active connection on my end. Unfortunately, I think this might be beyond what we can troubleshoot remotely. What I'm seeing is that the modem is trying to connect to our network, but something on our backend isn't responding properly.

Customer: So... what does that mean? How long until it's fixed?

Agent: Well, I'd like to get a technician out to your address to investigate further. They can check the line coming into your house, make sure all the connections are solid, and see if there's maybe an issue with the signal on our network in your area.

Customer: How long would that take?

Agent: Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) Looks like we have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could also schedule something for Thursday afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works. I'll take that.

Agent: Great. So I have you down for tomorrow, tomorrow being the 14th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. The technician will call you about an hour before they arrive. Is that number still 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell phone, so that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap, your internet service went down this morning, we've tried restarting the modem and doing a factory reset, but the issue appears to be on our network side. You've got a tech visit scheduled for tomorrow morning, and you should see that appointment in your Frontier account online.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. Is there anything I should do until the technician arrives?

Agent: Just leave the modem powered on. That way, if the service does come back online, you'll be ready to go. And if you have any questions before tomorrow, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Alright, will do. Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: My pleasure. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and again, sorry for the inconvenience today. Have a good one.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
