# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got important work stuff I need to do and I'm kind of losing it here.

Agent: I totally understand how frustrating that is. Let me pull up your account real quick so we can get you back online. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what name is the account under?

Customer: James Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got you here. I'm showing you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So it sounds like the internet went down this morning—do you remember what time that happened?

Customer: Um, sometime around eight o'clock, I think? My wife was saying something about hearing a noise outside, but I didn't think much of it.

Agent: Interesting. A noise outside? Okay. Well, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First thing I want you to do is look at your router. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on it right now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. The power light is on... it's green. But the internet light—that one's, uh... (pause) ...it's red. Is that bad?

Agent: Yeah, that red light means there's no connection coming into your modem. That actually tells me quite a bit. Have you tried restarting the router yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Let's try that. Just unplug the power cable from the back, and we'll wait about thirty seconds before you plug it back in.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just give it about half a minute while we're waiting. In the meantime, did anything change with your setup recently? New equipment, moved things around?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been working fine for months. That's why this is so weird.

Agent: Understood. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, lights are coming back on. The power's green again. Um... (pause) ...still red on the internet light though.

Agent: Still red. Okay. So that tells me the modem is powered up, but it's not getting a signal from our network. Let me check the line status here on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm. I'm not showing any service interruptions in your area, but let me look at your specific line... (pause) ...I'm actually seeing some inconsistencies here. Can you tell me, when you heard that noise this morning, what did it sound like?

Customer: Oh, uh, my wife just said it was like... I don't know, like a popping sound or something. Could that be related?

Agent: Could be. Do you know if there was any weather last night? Rain, lightning?

Customer: No, it was clear. But you know, there's been some construction in our neighborhood the past few days.

Agent: Ah, okay. That could be relevant. So here's what I think might be happening—we may have a physical issue with the line coming to your house, possibly from the construction. That red light suggests the signal isn't reaching your equipment. I want to have a technician come out and check the line. But first, let me try one more thing. Do you have a coax cable connecting your modem to the wall outlet?

Customer: Yeah, I can see it right here.

Agent: Can you check both ends of that cable and make sure they're screwed in tightly?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm checking... Yeah, they look pretty tight to me.

Agent: Try tightening them a bit more, just to be sure.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm... I'm tightening the one at the wall... and the one on the modem. (pause) Should I restart again?

Agent: Go ahead and restart it again, yeah.

Customer: (pause) Unplugging... (pause) ...waiting... (pause) ...plugging back in. (pause) Okay, it's back up. (pause) Still red. This isn't working, is it?

Agent: (pause) I'm not seeing any changes on my end either, James. Unfortunately, this is pointing to a line-level issue that I can't resolve remotely. We're going to need to get a technician out there to check your exterior lines and the connection point. 

Customer: How long is that going to take? I really need this working today.

Agent: Let me check availability. (typing sounds) (pause) We have same-day availability in your area. I can get someone out there this afternoon, between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, this afternoon works. That's better than I thought, actually.

Agent: Great. So I've got a technician scheduled for you today between 1 and 5 PM. Given the construction in your area and the symptoms we're seeing, they'll likely inspect the line from your house to the street, check the modem connection point, possibly look at the fiber run. It could be as simple as a loose connector or a cable damage from the construction.

Customer: Okay, well, hopefully it's something simple then.

Agent: Yeah, fingers crossed. I'm going to text you a confirmation with the service appointment details and a phone number you can call if you need to reschedule. Your technician may also call about fifteen minutes before they arrive. Is your cell number... (pause) ...555-0147?

Customer: No, that's the home phone. My cell is 555-0892.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it, I'm updating that now. So just to recap—we have a technician visit scheduled for today between 1 and 5 PM to investigate a line-level connectivity issue. You'll get a text confirmation, and they'll call before arriving.

Customer: Yep, got it. I appreciate your help with the troubleshooting, Derek, even though we couldn't get it working.

Agent: Of course, James. I'm sorry we weren't able to resolve it remotely, but the technician should be able to get to the root cause pretty quickly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your patience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Bye.

Customer: Bye.
