Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your phone number or account number, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thanks. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James. James Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. So you're saying your internet's been down since this morning? Walk me through what happened. Did it just stop working, or did you notice something before that?

Customer: Yeah, so I was working from home, and everything was fine, and then around 8 AM I just... the internet just cut out. And I've restarted the router a couple times, but nothing's worked. I don't even see the lights on it anymore.

Agent: Okay, so no lights on the router at all. That's helpful information. Let me ask you a few questions. Do you see any lights on your modem? That's the box that's usually separate from the router, if you have one.

Customer: Um... (pause) Actually, I'm not sure which one is which, to be honest. I just know there's like... there's a white box and a black box back there. The white one usually has lights.

Agent: That's perfectly fine. So the white box—does it have any lights on it right now?

Customer: No, nothing. It's completely dark.

Agent: Alright. And is that box plugged in? Can you check the power cable for me?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, yeah, it's plugged in. The cable's definitely in. Let me... (pause) Actually, wait. Oh, hold on. The power strip. Let me check if... (pause) No, the power strip is on. It's got other stuff plugged into it that's working fine.

Agent: Okay, good. So power's not the issue. I'm going to have you do a power cycle. Can you unplug that white box from the power cable, and then we'll wait about 30 seconds?

Customer: Sure, unplugging now.

Agent: (pause) Alright, go ahead and count to about 30 if you could.

Customer: Okay... one, two, three... (continues counting) ...twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

Agent: Perfect. Now plug it back in for me.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Plugging it back in now. Um, it's starting to do something. I see a light coming on. Okay, there's a blue light now. And it looks like... okay, there's a couple other lights flickering.

Agent: Great, that's what we want to see. Those lights should stabilize in about a minute or so. While we're waiting, let me ask you—do you have the black box as well? That would be your router.

Customer: Yeah, the black one is right next to it.

Agent: Can you do the same thing with that one? Unplug it, wait about 30 seconds, and plug it back in?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, unplugging the black one now. (pause) Counting... one, two, three... (continues counting in background) ...twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. Plugging it back in.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so now we should have both devices rebooting. This process usually takes a couple of minutes. Let's give it about two minutes and then I want you to try opening a web browser and let me know if you can access the internet, okay?

Customer: Okay, I'll do that. (typing sounds in background) (pause) Alright, so I'm trying to open Google right now and... hmm. Still nothing. It's just... it's loading. And loading. But nothing's happening.

Agent: Okay, still nothing. Let me ask you a couple more things. On that white box, are all the lights on now? Or are some of them blinking?

Customer: Um, let me see. (pause) Okay, so I've got a blue light that's solid, and then there's like a yellow light that's... it's blinking on and off. And then there's like a red light, I think? Yeah, a red light.

Agent: A red light? That's not what we typically want to see. A red light usually indicates an error of some kind. James, is that red light steady, or is it blinking?

Customer: It's... it's solid. It's just sitting there.

Agent: Okay. And that red light—is it on the modem, the white box?

Customer: Yes, on the white box.

Agent: Alright, let me put you on a brief hold. I'm going to check something in our system here to see if there are any outages in your area or any issues on our end. I'll just be one moment.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (hold music) ... (pause) ... Okay, James, thanks for holding. So I'm not seeing any outages in your area, which is good news. But that red light is telling me there might be a connection issue with your line coming into the house. Have you noticed any storm activity lately, or anything physical that might have happened to your lines outside?

Customer: No, I mean, it was a little rainy yesterday, but nothing crazy. And I haven't seen anything outside that looks damaged or anything.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Let me have you try one more thing. On that modem—the white box—can you locate a button that says "Reset"? It might be small and recessed.

Customer: (pause) Um, I see a lot of buttons here. There's like... let me look. (pause) I see "Power," and there's like a small button here. It looks like it might say "Reset" but it's pretty small.

Agent: That's it. Don't press it yet. Before you do that, I want to let you know that pressing the reset button will reset the modem to factory settings, which means you might lose your configuration. But at this point, it's worth trying. Go ahead and hold that button down for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it down... one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. (pause) Okay, the lights are all going crazy now. They're all flashing.

Agent: Perfect, that's normal. Let it sit for about a minute while it reinitializes.

(pause)

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the lights are still going crazy. There's a lot of blinking happening.

Agent: That's normal. Give it another 30 seconds or so.

(pause)

Customer: Alright, um, they're starting to calm down a little bit. I still see that red light though.

Agent: You still see the red light?

Customer: Yeah, the red light is back. Solid red.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, James, that's concerning. That red light usually means the modem isn't connecting to our network. I'm going to be honest with you—this might be something on the line side that I can't resolve over the phone. It could be a problem with the connection coming into your house from outside, or there could be an issue on our network side that I'm not seeing in the system.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Like, I need a technician to come out?

Agent: I think that's our best option at this point. Unfortunately, I've done all the troubleshooting steps I can do remotely, and the modem is still showing that error. A technician will be able to check the line coming into your house and check our infrastructure to see what's going on.

Customer: Okay. And how long would that take? I really need internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) We have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have a later slot on Thursday afternoon between 2 PM and 6 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning is fine. That's better than Thursday.

Agent: Great. Let me get that scheduled for you. The technician will arrive sometime between 8 and noon tomorrow. Can I get a callback number to confirm the appointment?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147, same as my account number.

Agent: Perfect. And is there anything else I can help you with today, or any questions about the appointment?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it quickly.

Agent: I completely understand, James. I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved today, but our technician will be able to take a look at everything tomorrow. You should receive a confirmation text or call shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, James. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
