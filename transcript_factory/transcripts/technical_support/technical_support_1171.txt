Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. So, uh, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm showing an account for... Robert Chen at 412 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you noticed any lights on your modem? Like, is it powered on at all?

Customer: Um, yeah, I can see it. Let me... okay, so the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light—the one that usually blinks? That one's red and it's just staying solid red.

Agent: Okay, so the power is good but the internet connection light is red. That's actually a pretty common indicator. Have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I did that already. I unplugged it, waited like thirty seconds, plugged it back in. It came back on with the same red light, so that didn't help.

Agent: Alright, let me check on our end. Can you give me just one second? (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm not seeing any service alerts in your area, which is good news. Let me ask you this—do you have a separate router, or is it all-in-one?

Customer: No, I have a separate one. It's a... uh, it's a white Netgear router.

Agent: Okay, good. And is that one powered on as well?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. The lights are all on normally, but it's still not working because it's not getting anything from the modem.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. So let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem again and wait about two minutes this time? Sometimes it needs a longer reset to reconnect to our network.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that now. It's unplugged. (background noise, rustling) I'll just... I'll wait here.

Agent: No problem. Take your time.

Customer: (after about 30 seconds) Okay, so it's been a minute and a half, I'll plug it back in now. (beeping sounds, pause) Alright, it's plugging back in. Okay, lights are... the power light is green, and now... (pause) ...nope, the internet light is still red.

Agent: Still red, huh? Okay, that's... that's a bit unusual. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) So I'm actually going to check if we're seeing any connection attempts from your modem. Can you tell me what the model number is on your modem?

Customer: Uh, it's a... let me look here... it says Frontier Advanced WiFi Gateway. Model FR-something... FR-G804.

Agent: The G804, got it. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history and I'm not seeing any recent connection attempts from that modem. That's... that suggests the modem might not be able to communicate with our network.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it broken or something?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be an issue with the modem itself, or it could be something on our network side that's preventing it from connecting. Let me try one more thing. Can you check the back of the modem and tell me if there's a red light or an orange light anywhere else?

Customer: (pause, rustling) Um, no, I'm looking at the back... I don't see any lights back here. Just the power cable and... internet cables and stuff. The only lights are on the front.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Alright, I'm going to try something from my end. I'm going to restart your modem remotely. This should take just a minute or two. Can you keep an eye on it and let me know what happens with those lights?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, initiating the restart now... and... let me know when you see it powering down.

Customer: (pause) Okay, the green light just went off. It's all dark now.

Agent: Good, good. It should power back up in about thirty seconds or so.

Customer: (pause, beeping) Okay, the power light is coming back on... it's green again... and I'm waiting for the internet light... (pause) Nope. Red light again.

Agent: Still red. (pause) Okay, Robert, I gotta be honest with you—this is... this is not what we typically see. Usually a remote restart resolves these connection issues. The fact that we're not seeing any connection attempts and the light isn't changing suggests either the modem has a hardware failure or there's something preventing it from reaching our network on your line.

Customer: So what do we do? Can you send someone out, or...?

Agent: We can definitely do that. But before we schedule a technician visit, I want to try just one or two more things if you're okay with that?

Customer: Yeah, okay, go ahead.

Agent: Great. Can you check one more time that the cable going from your wall to the modem is secure? Just wiggle it a bit and make sure it's pushed in all the way?

Customer: (rustling, pause) Yeah, it's... it feels pretty secure. It's in there pretty tight.

Agent: And you're not seeing any cracks or damage on the cable itself?

Customer: No, it looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay. And just to confirm—you have power to the modem, you've tried power cycling it multiple times, we've restarted it remotely... (pause) Let me actually try one last thing here. I'm going to check if maybe the modem needs a firmware update. Can you hold the reset button on the modem for about ten seconds? It's usually a small button on the back.

Customer: A reset button? (rustling) I'm looking for it... I see a little hole here. Is that it?

Agent: That's probably it, yeah. You'll need something small like a paperclip to press it. Give it a ten second hold.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I got a paperclip. (beeping) I'm pressing it... holding it... (pause, beeping sounds) Okay, I've been holding it for like fifteen seconds. Let me let go. (pause) The modem is going dark again and... okay, it's restarting. Lights are coming back on... power is green... and internet is... (long pause) ...still red.

Agent: (pause) Still red.

Customer: Yeah.

Agent: Okay, Robert, I think at this point we've exhausted the basic troubleshooting steps. The modem isn't connecting to our network, we've done everything we can from our end, and I'm not seeing a service issue in your area. I believe we need to get a technician out to your location to either diagnose what's going on with that modem or check your line. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I don't really have a choice here, do I? How soon can someone get out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. What days work best for you?

Customer: Uh... I'm working from home, so honestly the sooner the better. Is tomorrow possible?

Agent: (pause, typing) Let me see here... we have availability tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Does that window work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm scheduling a technician visit for tomorrow, Thursday, between 12 and 4 PM. The technician will assess whether it's a modem issue or a line issue. If it's the modem, we can replace it at no charge since you're still under warranty.

Customer: Okay, good. And what should I do with the modem in the meantime?

Agent: Just leave it plugged in as it is. Don't mess with it. The technician will take care of everything tomorrow. You should receive a confirmation email shortly, and you can also check your account online to see the technician's window.

Customer: Alright, I got it.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved today, Robert. I know this is inconvenient, especially when you're working from home. But the technician will definitely take care of it for you tomorrow.

Customer: It's alright, Derek. Thanks for trying. I appreciate it.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
