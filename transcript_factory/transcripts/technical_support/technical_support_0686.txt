# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went out completely and I've been without it for like... I don't know, a couple hours now? I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm pulling that up now. And your name?

Customer: It's James. James Peterson.

Agent: Great, James. Got you here. So you're saying your internet is completely down right now? Like, you have no connection at all?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. I tried unplugging the modem and router like I always do when something goes wrong, but... nothing. The lights on the modem aren't even coming on the way they usually do.

Agent: Alright, that's actually really helpful information. So the modem isn't powering on at all. Let me just ask you a couple quick questions. Is the power cable plugged in securely to the modem and to the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean... let me check. (background noise) Yeah, it's plugged in. Both ends.

Agent: Okay, good. And that outlet itself—do you have another device you could plug into it to make sure it's actually getting power?

Customer: Um, yeah. Let me try... (pause) I've got a lamp here. (sound of plugging in) Yeah, the lamp comes on, so the outlet's working fine.

Agent: Perfect. That rules that out. Now, let me ask you this—do you have the power adapter, the brick, for your modem? Can you take a look at it and tell me if the light on it is on or off?

Customer: (pause) (sound of rustling) Okay, I'm looking at it now. The light... it's off. It's not lit up at all.

Agent: Alright, so the power adapter itself isn't getting power. That's... okay. That's actually a common issue we see. Can you unplug it and plug it back in for me?

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...nothing changed. Still dark.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, and just to triple-check—you are plugging the brick, the adapter, directly into the wall, right? Not into a power strip or surge protector?

Customer: Oh, well... actually, yeah, it is plugged into a power strip. Let me try moving it. (sound of unplugging, pause) Let me plug it into the wall directly... (pause) ...still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Okay. You know what, that might be it. Power adapters can sometimes fail, especially if there's been a power surge in your area. Have you had any storms recently or a power outage?

Customer: Actually, yeah. We did have some crazy thunderstorms last night. Pretty intense lightning and everything.

Agent: That could definitely be it. A power surge can damage the adapter. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) Looking at your account, I'm going to need to send a technician out to replace that adapter. Let me check our availability... (pause) We have someone who can come out tomorrow between 2 and 5 PM, or we have a later slot on Thursday if that works better?

Customer: Can't it be today? I really need my internet. I work from home and I've already lost like two hours of work.

Agent: I totally understand, and I wish I could get someone out there today. Let me check one more time... (pause) Unfortunately, our dispatch is completely booked for today. The earliest we can get someone is tomorrow afternoon. I sincerely apologize for that.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Alright, fine. Tomorrow. What time exactly?

Agent: So it'll be between 2 and 5 PM. They'll give us a call about 30 minutes before they arrive so you're not waiting around all day. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I guess so. That's not ideal but okay.

Agent: I really do apologize. Before we wrap up, let me just try one more thing with you real quick. Is there any chance you have an old power adapter lying around from a previous modem? Sometimes customers have old equipment in a closet or something.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, I don't think so. I mean, I've only been with Frontier for like a year and a half, so...

Agent: Yeah, that would be a long shot. Okay, James, so I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, 2 to 5 PM. Is the address on file still 847 Riverside Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you have it, here's your service ticket number: it's 4-7-8-9-2-1-X-Q. I'd write that down if you can.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I got it. 478921XQ.

Agent: That's exactly right. The technician will have that in their system. They'll just need access to where your modem is set up. 

Customer: Yeah, no problem.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully this gets resolved tomorrow.

Agent: I totally understand your frustration, James. This should definitely be resolved once we get that power adapter replaced. If for some reason the technician can't make it tomorrow, they'll contact you to reschedule. You've got my name, Derek, and you have that ticket number if you need to reach back out to us.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and sorry again for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
