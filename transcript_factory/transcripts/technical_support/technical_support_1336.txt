Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just completely stopped working like an hour ago and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got work stuff I need to do and it's really frustrating.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I totally understand how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And just to confirm, is this for the account under... Michael Torres?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. And can you tell me a little bit about what's happening right now? When you try to connect, what do you see or experience?

Customer: Well, nothing's happening. Like, I have a laptop and my phone, and neither of them can connect to the Wi-Fi. The router is... it's like over there (gestures vaguely) and I can see it's on, the lights are on and stuff, but nothing's connecting to it.

Agent: Okay, so the router is powered on but devices aren't connecting to the Wi-Fi network. Have you noticed if the internet light specifically is lit up? That would typically be a blue or white light on the front of the router.

Customer: Um... (pause) Let me look at this thing. I don't really know which one's which, honestly.

Agent: No problem, no problem. Can you describe what lights you see on there?

Customer: Okay, so there's like... one on the top that's blue and blinking. Then there's two more below it, and they're like... one looks kind of red or orange maybe? And the other one's off, I think.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so that blinking blue light is probably power, which is good. The orange or red light though—that typically indicates there's no internet signal coming to the modem. That's usually the issue. So the router itself is working, but it's not getting a signal from our network.

Customer: Oh, okay. So like, is that something I can fix?

Agent: Well, let's try a few things. First, do you have a modem separate from the router? Or is it an all-in-one unit?

Customer: I think it's all in one? Like, it's just one box.

Agent: Okay, that makes sense. So what we're going to do is power cycle it. Can you unplug it from the wall for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm doing that now.

Agent: Great. And while we're waiting—just leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds, okay? That'll help reset the system.

Customer: Alright, I'm... yeah, I'm just standing here. (chuckles) This is taking forever.

Agent: I know, I know. Just a few more seconds. (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now we're going to give it about two minutes to fully boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me—have there been any storms in your area recently? Or any outages you're aware of?

Customer: No storms that I know of. Um, actually, wait—my neighbor came by like an hour ago and mentioned something about construction on our street? They were doing some work out there this morning.

Agent: Ah, okay. That could potentially be it, actually. Sometimes if there's construction on the line, the physical fiber line could be damaged or disrupted. Did you notice anything unusual outside? Like any damage to cables or anything like that?

Customer: I mean, I didn't really look that closely, but... I could go check?

Agent: That might be helpful, actually. But first let's see if the modem's back up. Do you see the lights looking any different now?

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, the blue light is still blinking, and... wait, is the one that was red supposed to turn green? Because it's still orange.

Agent: (slight sigh) Yeah, ideally that should have turned green by now, which would mean we've got a signal. The fact that it's staying orange or red means the modem isn't detecting the internet signal coming in. (typing sounds) 

Okay, let me check our system here to see if there are any known issues in your area. (pause) I'm pulling up your location now... (more typing) 

Michael, I'm not seeing any widespread outages flagged in your area right now, so it does seem isolated to your address. And given that you mentioned construction this morning, I'm wondering if there's been some damage to the fiber line leading to your house.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is my internet just... gone?

Agent: Not necessarily. It could be a temporary issue that resolves itself, or it could be something we need to send a technician out to look at. But before we do that, I'd like to try one more thing. Can you check your modem for a small reset button? It's usually on the back, and you'd need a paper clip or something thin to press it.

Customer: A reset button... (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the back... I see a bunch of ports... there's one little hole here. Is that it?

Agent: That could be it, yeah. It would be a small hole, recessed into the back.

Customer: Okay, so I press it with like... a pen?

Agent: Yeah, a pen would work. Go ahead and hold it down for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I'm holding it... (more pause) Alright, it's done.

Agent: Good. Now give it another two minutes or so to fully reboot. This reset is going to restore it to factory settings, so it might take a minute.

Customer: (pause) So if this doesn't work, what happens?

Agent: Well, if that doesn't resolve it, then we'd likely need to get a technician out to your location to inspect the line. They could probably come out as early as tomorrow, depending on availability. But let's see if this works first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, um... it's still the same. The light is still orange.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Still not getting that signal. 

Customer: So that's... that's not good, right?

Agent: Unfortunately, it does look like there's a service issue on our end. Either there's damage to the line from that construction, or there's something else happening with the connection to your house. At this point, I think we need to get a technician to come assess it in person.

Customer: When can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability... (typing sounds) It looks like we have some openings tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I mean... I guess I have to make it work. But this is really inconvenient.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm going to go ahead and schedule that appointment for you tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM window. You should receive a confirmation email or text within the next few minutes. The technician will be able to diagnose exactly what's going on and get you back up and running.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate you trying, at least.

Agent: Of course. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve it over the phone. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Okay. Thank you for calling Frontier, Michael, and sorry again for the trouble. We'll get this fixed for you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
