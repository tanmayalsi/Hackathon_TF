# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I work from home and I've got calls coming up.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm showing an account under the name Robert Chen. Is that you?

Customer: Yep, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So your internet service has been down since this morning. Has it been completely out the whole time, or are you getting any connection at all?

Customer: Nothing. I mean, like... the router is on, the lights are blinking, but when I try to open any website, nothing loads. It just times out.

Agent: Okay, so the router appears to be powered on and showing activity, but you're not able to access the internet. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. Have you tried power cycling the router yet? Just turning it off and back on?

Customer: Yeah, I did that like an hour ago. Didn't help.

Agent: Alright. And how long ago would you say you last had a working connection?

Customer: Um... maybe around 7 this morning? I was checking my email and everything was fine, then I went to grab coffee and when I came back, nothing.

Agent: Got it. So it was sudden. Did you experience any storms last night, or any power outages at all?

Customer: (pause) No, actually, it's been pretty clear here. Why, is that usually... I mean, does that matter?

Agent: It can, yeah. Sometimes weather events can affect the connection or power delivery to our equipment. But if you didn't have any issues like that, that's helpful information. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area, so it's likely something specific to your connection or equipment.

Customer: Okay, so what do we do?

Agent: Let's go through a few more steps. Can you tell me what you're seeing on your router right now? Are all the lights lit up, or is anything off or flashing red?

Customer: Uh... (pause) let me look. So I've got like, a power light that's solid green, then there's one that says "Internet" and that one's... it's like an amber or yellow color, and it's blinking.

Agent: Yellow and blinking. That's actually really useful information. That typically indicates that the router is trying to connect to our network but hasn't established a stable connection. Robert, let me have you try something for me. I want you to unplug the router completely—not just turn it off, but physically unplug it from the wall.

Customer: Okay... (pause) unplugging it now.

Agent: And while that's unplugged, I also want you to check the cable coming from the wall. The coaxial cable—it's the one that looks like a TV cable. Can you see if it's connected to the back of your modem?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's screwed in pretty tight.

Agent: Okay, great. Go ahead and gently unscrew that. Not all the way, just so you can see the connection.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's... it's loose now. Um, it looks okay to me? I don't see anything wrong with it.

Agent: Sometimes debris or a bad connection can cause these issues even if it looks fine to the naked eye. Try reconnecting it—making sure it's hand-tight, not like... you don't need to use tools or anything.

Customer: Okay, I've got it back in. Now what?

Agent: Now go ahead and plug the router back in. This should give it a fresh start with a good connection to the line.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. So now I just... wait?

Agent: Yeah, let's give it about two minutes to boot back up and establish a connection. That Internet light should go from blinking yellow to solid green if it successfully connects.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, I'm watching it. It's... still blinking yellow. (frustrated sigh) Come on...

Agent: I know, just give it another moment. Sometimes it takes a little longer.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. It's been like thirty seconds and it's still doing the same thing.

Agent: Okay, let me look into this from my end. Let me check if we're seeing your modem connecting to our network. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm. I'm not seeing an active connection from your equipment right now. That suggests there might be an issue on the line side, or possibly the modem itself is having a problem.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Can you fix it remotely or...?

Agent: Well, let me try sending a signal reset to your modem. Sometimes that can help reestablish the connection. (typing sounds) Alright, I've sent that through. Let's see if that helps.

Customer: (pause) Still yellow. This is... I really need this working. I have a meeting in like, forty minutes.

Agent: I understand, Robert. Let me try a couple more things. Can you check something for me? On the back of your modem—do you see any lights besides the ones you mentioned? Anything that might indicate a power issue or an error?

Customer: (pause) There's one that just says "Power" in green, the Internet one we talked about that's yellow, and then there's like... a WiFi symbol I think? That one's also yellow and blinking.

Agent: Okay, so the WiFi light is blinking too. Let me ask you this—if you were to plug in directly to the modem with an ethernet cable, do you have one of those available?

Customer: Um... I should have one around here somewhere. It might be in the office. Let me... (background noise, shuffling) Yeah, I've got one.

Agent: Great. Can you plug one end into the ethernet port on the back of the modem and the other end directly into your computer?

Customer: (pause) (more shuffling) Okay, doing that now. I've got the cable connected.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's see if you're able to get online using that direct connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me... (pause) trying to open a website... (longer pause) No. Nothing. It's still not connecting. The computer says I'm connected to the network but I can't access anything.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Okay, that tells me the issue isn't with your WiFi, so it's coming from the modem itself or the line coming in. (typing sounds) Let me check one more thing on the line side... (pause) I'm going to be honest with you, Robert—I'm not detecting your modem on our network at all right now. Which means either the signal isn't reaching the modem, or the modem itself may have failed.

Customer: So... what does that mean I need to do?

Agent: Well, those are two different issues. If it's the line, that would require a technician to come out and check the connection from the pole. If it's the modem, we'd need to send you a replacement. Before we go down that road though, let me try one more reset. I'm going to perform a factory reset on the modem from my end. I need to warn you though—if you have custom WiFi settings, those will be erased and go back to default.

Customer: Whatever, just do it. I just need internet working.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, sending that through now. (pause) This should take a few seconds to process.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... the lights just went dark for a second, and now they're back on.

Agent: Good, that's what should happen. Let's give it about ninety seconds to fully reboot.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it... (longer pause) It's still yellow. Both lights are still yellow and blinking.

Agent: (pause) Okay, Robert. Unfortunately, at this point, I think we need to escalate this. The modem is not establishing a connection to our network, and the resets aren't resolving it. We have two options here.

Customer: Which are...?

Agent: Option one is we can schedule a technician visit to your location. They would come out and test the line coming into your home to make sure everything is working on our end. Option two is we can send you a replacement modem, which would take a few business days to arrive. If you want to try the modem first, that's usually the faster path to getting back online if it's a modem issue. But if it's a line issue, you'll still need the tech visit eventually.

Customer: How long for a technician? I can't be without internet for days.

Agent: The earliest availability I'm seeing right now is... tomorrow afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. I know that's not ideal.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) And if it's just the modem, how long for a replacement?

Agent: Typically three to five business days for standard shipping.

Customer: So either way I'm screwed for a while. (pause) You know what, schedule the technician. At least they can tell us what's actually wrong. Can you do that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that set up for you. So that would be tomorrow, between 1 and 5 PM. Does that work with your schedule?

Customer: Yeah, I mean... I'll make it work. What else do I need to do?

Agent: You'll want to make sure someone's home to let them in. They'll be able to test everything and hopefully get you back up and running. I'm going to send a confirmation email to the address on your account with all the details, including a window where they should arrive.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with tonight, Robert?

Customer: (pause) No, I guess... I guess that's it. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I understand. I'm sorry you're dealing with this right now, especially with work. The technician will definitely be able to get to the bottom of it. Your confirmation should come through in the next few minutes.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for giving us a call, and I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online tonight. You have a good evening, Robert.

Customer: Yeah, you too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
