# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. Can I get your name and account number please?

Customer: Hi, yeah, it's Tom Richardson. Account number is... let me see, it's 4-7-2-9-8-5-1.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Tom, I've got your account here. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago. I haven't changed anything, didn't unplug anything, it just... stopped working. I've got no connection at all.

Agent: Oh, that's frustrating. Okay, let me pull up your account details here. (typing sounds) It looks like your service has been active with no recent changes. Have you tried unplugging your modem and router yet?

Customer: Yeah, actually I did that right away. Unplugged it for like thirty seconds, plugged it back in, waited for all the lights to come back on, and nothing. Still no connection.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting there. Alright, so when you say no connection... is your modem powering on? Are you seeing any lights on it?

Customer: Um, yeah, the power light is on. It's the white light, right? That's normally on?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. And do you see any other lights? Any that might be orange or red?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, actually. There's like an orange light that's usually not there. It's next to where it says "Internet" on the modem.

Agent: That orange light is actually indicating a connection issue. Okay, so I'm going to walk you through a few more things. Can you tell me where your modem is located?

Customer: It's in my living room, it's mounted on the wall right above my TV stand.

Agent: Alright, and can you see the cables connected to it? I need you to check if the coaxial cable—that's the thick cable with the connector—is plugged in securely on the back.

Customer: (pause, sound of movement) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. It looks pretty tight to me. I can see it's definitely plugged in.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and unplug that cable from the modem for me.

Customer: Done.

Agent: Now, can you follow that cable and check if it's connected to the wall outlet? And if it is, I need you to make sure it's tight there too.

Customer: (sound of movement) Yeah, it's connected to the wall. And I'm giving it a little... (grunt) ...there, I tightened it up. It was a bit loose actually.

Agent: Good catch. Okay, now plug it back into the modem.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's back in. Now what?

Agent: Let's wait about two minutes for the modem to reboot. Go ahead and give me a call back if those lights change, but let's just wait and see.

Customer: Okay. (long pause) So, how long do you think this is gonna take?

Agent: Well, we're just going through some basic troubleshooting right now. Should only be a few more minutes. Can you tell me what you were doing right before the internet stopped working?

Customer: Uh, nothing really. I was just watching TV, streaming something on Netflix. And then all of a sudden the picture buffered and then just went black. I didn't hear any storm or anything, so... I don't know what happened.

Agent: Okay. (typing sounds) That's helpful. Alright, it's been about two minutes. Can you check the modem again for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it. The orange light is... still there. The power light is still on, but that orange light is still there.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That orange light is typically a connection issue. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, so that's good news. Tom, I'm going to try doing a remote reboot of your modem. This should take about three to five minutes. You'll see all the lights go dark and then come back on. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

Agent: Okay, starting that now. (pause, typing sounds) It's processing. While we wait, have you had any issues with your service recently? Any outages or slow speeds?

Customer: No, honestly, it's been great. This is the first time anything like this has happened.

Agent: That's good to hear. We appreciate that. Okay... (pause) ...and the reboot is complete. What are you seeing on the modem now?

Customer: (pause) Um... still the orange light. The power light is on, but that orange light is still there. And actually, now I'm not seeing the... there's usually a light that shows activity, like when data's moving? I'm not seeing that one anymore either.

Agent: Okay. (pause, typing sounds) Alright, I'm showing the modem is connected to our network on my end, but you're still not getting internet on your devices, correct?

Customer: Right. Nothing. I tried my laptop, I tried my phone on WiFi, nothing. Complete dead.

Agent: Let me try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the modem for me? There should be a small reset button on the back. You'll need something thin like a paperclip to press it.

Customer: (sound of movement) Yeah, I've got a paperclip. (pause) I'm pressing it... (pause) ...and I'm holding it... (pause) Okay, the lights are all going out.

Agent: Perfect. Now we wait for them to come back on. This should take about five minutes this time.

Customer: Okay. (pause) So this would fix it if something is wrong internally, right?

Agent: Right, exactly. A factory reset basically clears everything on the modem and returns it to its default state. It should reinitialize the connection to our network.

Customer: (pause) And if that doesn't work?

Agent: Well, let's see how this goes first. We can discuss options after that. (long pause, background noise) While we're waiting, let me just let you know that if we can't get this resolved today, we'd be happy to schedule a technician visit. We have availability tomorrow or the next day.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. (pause) Hey, are the lights supposed to come back on by now? It's been like five minutes.

Agent: Let me check. Sometimes it can take a bit longer. Go ahead and check the modem for me.

Customer: (sound of movement, pause) Okay, now the power light is on. And I'm seeing... the orange light is back. But now there's also like a... there's a red light that's on. Is that bad?

Agent: (pause) The red light is... that's not ideal. That typically means there's a more serious connection issue. (typing sounds, pause) Tom, I'm showing that the modem is not registering properly on our network right now. I've been working through troubleshooting with you for about fifteen minutes, and I think at this point we might need to get a technician out to your location to look at the physical line. There could be an issue outside, or it could be an issue with the modem itself that we can't resolve over the phone.

Customer: Oh man. Really? (pause) Okay, so you can't fix it from there?

Agent: I wish I could. At this point, it's beyond what I can do remotely. But here's what I can do—I can get a technician scheduled for you. Like I mentioned, we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or the day after that as well. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning works better than nothing, I guess. Let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm getting that scheduled for you now. The appointment is set for tomorrow, December 14th, between 8 AM and noon. Is there a phone number where we can reach you if the technician needs to contact you?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. So to recap, your appointment is tomorrow from 8 AM to noon. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. And I'm putting a note on your account that you've already tried the basic troubleshooting steps—the cable tightening and the factory reset—so they'll know what we've attempted.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Is there anything else I should try before they come out?

Agent: Honestly, I'd just leave the modem plugged in so they can see the error lights when they arrive. Other than that, just keep it as is. They'll take it from there.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate the help.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today, Tom. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's all. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
