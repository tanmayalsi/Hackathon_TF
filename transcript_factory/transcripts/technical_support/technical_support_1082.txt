# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went down about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll get this sorted out for you. Let me just pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. And can you confirm the service address for me?

Customer: It's 4328 Oakwood Drive, apartment 2B.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you're experiencing a complete loss of service right now?

Customer: Yeah, complete. Like, there's no lights on the modem or anything. It's totally dead.

Agent: Alright, let's start with the basics then. Can you tell me what you've done so far to try to troubleshoot?

Customer: Um, I unplugged the modem for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in. I also tried unplugging the router. And I restarted my computer, but that didn't help either.

Agent: Okay, that's good. Those are the right first steps. Now, when you plugged the modem back in, did you see any lights come on at all?

Customer: (pause) No, nothing. It's just... dark. The power cable is definitely plugged in though. I checked that like three times.

Agent: Understood. Let me just check our systems here to see if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported in your neighborhood, so that's good news. Let's try a different approach. Can you check the power outlet you're using? Do you have another device you could plug in to verify that outlet is working?

Customer: Oh, good idea. (pause) Uh, yeah. Let me... (background noise) Okay, I plugged my lamp in and it turned on, so the outlet's fine.

Agent: Great, so the outlet is definitely working. Now, when you look at the modem, are there any indicator lights at all? Even just one?

Customer: (pause) No, I'm looking at it right now and... nothing. It's completely dark.

Agent: Okay. And just to be thorough—this might sound obvious, but is the power cable fully inserted into the back of the modem?

Customer: (slight frustration) Yeah, I already checked. It's in there pretty firmly actually. I even wiggled it a little.

Agent: I believe you. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) So I'm showing that we've actually had a service issue flagged at your location within the last couple hours. It's possible there's a line issue coming from outside. Before we go further, I want to try one more thing with you.

Customer: Okay, what?

Agent: I'm going to send a signal to your modem remotely. When I do that, I'd like you to watch it and tell me if you see anything—any lights flicker, any sounds, anything at all. Give me just one second. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, sending it now...

Customer: (pause) Uh... nothing. I don't see anything. No lights, no sounds. Nothing happened.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, that's what I was concerned about. That signal would normally initialize the modem, but if there's no response at all, it means either the modem isn't receiving power, or... (pause) ...there's a hardware failure with the device itself.

Customer: Okay, so what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. First, I'd like you to try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem completely and wait about two minutes before plugging it back in?

Customer: Two minutes? That seems like a long time.

Agent: I know, but it helps the capacitors fully drain. Just trust me on this one.

Customer: (sighs) Alright, fine. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. I'm just sitting here waiting... (long pause) (background noise of someone else speaking faintly) Okay, it's been about two minutes. Plugging it back in now. (pause) (pause) Nope. Still nothing. Still dark.

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately, that didn't work. Here's what I'm thinking—it's possible the modem itself has failed, or there's an issue with the line coming into your apartment that's preventing power delivery. (pause) I'm going to be honest with you, at this point I think we need to get a technician out to your location to diagnose this properly.

Customer: A technician? How long is that going to take? I really need my internet up.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so our next available appointment window is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (frustrated) Tomorrow? That's the earliest?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. We do have emergency service available, but that would be an additional charge of $79.95 for a same-day visit, and even then, I can't guarantee we have a technician available in your area today at this hour.

Customer: What time is it?

Agent: It's 6:15 PM right now.

Customer: (pause) No, I... I can't do the extra charge. I guess tomorrow morning is fine. Can you make sure someone's going to actually show up?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm scheduling you for a service call tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM window. A technician will come assess the modem and the line. If it's a modem issue, they can swap that out on-site. If it's a line problem, they'll work on that as well.

Customer: And you don't know what's causing it?

Agent: Based on the troubleshooting we've done—the outlet works, the cable is properly connected, the modem doesn't respond to remote signals—my best guess is either the modem has experienced a hardware failure, or there's a distribution line issue in your building. The technician will be able to tell for sure when they get there.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Okay. Fine. So tomorrow morning.

Agent: Yes, tomorrow morning. I'm going to send you a confirmation email and a text message with your appointment details and our technician's direct number so you can reach them if needed. The reference number for this service call is FSC-774829. Do you want me to read that back?

Customer: No, I've got it. Will I get charged anything if it's a hardware issue?

Agent: Your modem should still be under warranty, so if it's a hardware failure, we'd replace it at no charge. You'd only have the $49.99 service call fee to diagnose, but we'll waive that if we end up replacing equipment due to a defect.

Customer: Alright. I guess that's... something.

Agent: I'm sorry I couldn't get this resolved for you today over the phone. I know this is frustrating.

Customer: Yeah, well, I work from home, so this is pretty inconvenient.

Agent: I understand completely. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I guess I'll see what happens tomorrow.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for your patience with us today, and we'll see you tomorrow morning. Have a good night.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
