Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I have a meeting in like an hour and I need to be able to connect.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me definitely help you get that sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147... and can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Torres.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got you here. So your internet service went down this morning? Do you remember what time that happened?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around like 8:30 or 9 AM. I was working from home and just... nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Okay, and just to confirm, you're not seeing any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Well, the modem's got... let me see... there's a red light on it. The power light's red.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is red. That's actually a sign that there might be something going on. Um, the modem should have a solid green or blue light when everything's working normally. Let me walk you through a quick restart. Can you locate the power cord on your modem right now?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's right there behind my desk.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and unplug it for me, and we'll wait about 30 seconds before we plug it back in. That'll give it a chance to fully reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugged. I'm counting... (pause) ...and going... now. Plugging it back in.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) So while that's booting back up, let me just ask you – have you had any weather in your area recently? Any storms or anything like that?

Customer: Uh, actually, yeah. There was that bad storm yesterday, but I mean... my internet was working last night, so...

Agent: Right, right. But sometimes the equipment can be affected the next day. Okay, so now what lights are you seeing on the modem? Give it maybe 10 more seconds to fully come up.

Customer: (pause) Um... okay, so I'm seeing... the power light is still doing something weird. It's like flickering between red and amber now.

Agent: Flickering between red and amber. Hmm. (pause) Okay, that's... that's not ideal. Let me try one more thing here. Are you able to see your router as well? That's the separate device that broadcasts your WiFi?

Customer: Oh, yeah, yeah. That's right next to it. That one's... it's off. The lights aren't even on.

Agent: Okay, so the router's not powered on at all. Can you plug that in for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm doing that now... (pause) Okay, powered on. I see a light coming up. It's... it looks like it's amber right now.

Agent: Okay, good, that's... that's normal while it's booting up. Give it about a minute to fully initialize. While we wait, let me just check something on my end here. (typing sounds) 

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) So I'm looking at your account, and it does show that we had a service interruption in your area yesterday during the storm. Looks like it was resolved around 11 PM. But I'm not seeing any current outages reported, so...

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, it should be working?

Agent: In theory, yeah, it should have come back online. Let me just ask – can you try connecting to your WiFi on your phone or a laptop? Just to see if you get any signal at all?

Customer: Yeah, let me... (pause) I'm pulling up the WiFi networks... hmm. I'm not seeing my network name in the list. Like, there's nothing coming from my router.

Agent: You're not seeing it at all? (pause) Okay, um, and the router light – what color is it now?

Customer: Still amber. Just sitting there, amber.

Agent: Alright, it should have turned green by now. That's actually... that's unusual. Okay, I want to try something. This might sound redundant, but can you do the same process with the router? Unplug it, wait 30 seconds, and plug it back in?

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, sure. Unplugging now. (pause) Waiting... (pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: And we'll just give it another minute to come back up.

Customer: (pause) Mmhmm.

Agent: In the meantime, um, I'm looking at your modem here. Let me just verify – the model you have should be a Frontier-issued modem. Does it say anything on the device itself? Like a model number?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it says... FR-G2100 or something like that?

Agent: FR-G2100, okay, good. That's one of our standard units. (pause) Alright, so what's the router showing now?

Customer: Um, still amber. Nothing's changed, honestly.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Um, let me put you on a brief hold while I check with our technical support team about any ongoing issues that might not be showing up on the main outage map yet. It'll just be one moment.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Thank you for holding, Michael. Okay, so I checked and there aren't any reported issues in your specific service area right now, which is... it's puzzling given what you're experiencing. 

Customer: Yeah, that's frustrating.

Agent: I totally understand. So I want to try one more thing before we potentially escalate this. Can you check if there's any external damage to the cables coming into your modem? The line that comes from outside?

Customer: (pause) The cable? Um, I can see where it comes in through the wall... (pause) It looks okay to me? I mean, I don't see anything obviously broken or anything.

Agent: Okay, and the cable itself is plugged securely into the modem on the back?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's in there pretty tight.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Michael, I've got to be honest with you here – given everything we've tried and the symptoms you're describing, I think this is potentially a problem on the line side that's going to need a technician to come out and take a look at.

Customer: A technician? Like, when could that happen? Because I said I have this meeting...

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) So the earliest I'm showing for a technician visit would be... tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Given that there was damage in your area yesterday from the storm, we're running a bit behind, but I can prioritize this for you.

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean... can't you do anything today?

Agent: I wish I could, Michael, I really do. Our field service teams are fully booked this afternoon. All the storm damage from yesterday has kept everyone pretty slammed. But I can definitely make sure tomorrow is marked as urgent.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, yeah, I guess... I'll have to figure something out for my meeting. Can I at least get a credit or something for this downtime?

Agent: That's absolutely fair. I can get a credit applied for you – I'm going to go ahead and put one week of service credit on your next bill for the inconvenience.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that.

Agent: And let me just confirm – I have your number down as 555-0147, and we'll have someone out between 1 and 5 PM tomorrow. You'll get a call around 30 minutes before they arrive. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that... that should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. And Michael, I apologize again that we couldn't get this sorted out over the phone today. Hopefully it's just a line issue that the tech can fix pretty quickly.

Customer: Alright, thanks Derek. I appreciate you trying.

Agent: Of course. You have a good rest of your day, and thanks for being a Frontier customer.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
