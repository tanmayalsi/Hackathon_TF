Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking here... and I've got you pulled up. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So your internet's been down since this morning, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, since like... I don't know, maybe around 8 or 9 AM? I tried unplugging everything but nothing's worked.

Agent: Alright, well let's troubleshoot this together and see if we can get you back online. First, I'm going to ask you a few quick questions. Are you seeing any lights on your router right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) yeah, there's like a red light on the front. Is that bad?

Agent: A red light, okay. So that typically indicates there's either a connection issue or a power issue. Can you tell me what model router you have? It should say on the back or the bottom.

Customer: (pause) Let me look... it says... uh, "Astera2" I think?

Agent: Okay, perfect. And is there a power cable connected to it?

Customer: Yeah, it's plugged into the wall outlet right behind my TV stand.

Agent: Good. Can you do me a favor and unplug it for me? Just pull the power cable right out of the wall.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Done.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to count to thirty before you plug it back in. This'll do a full reset of the device.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...one, two, three... (pause) ...thirty. Okay, plugging it back in now. (sound of plugging in)

Agent: Excellent. Give it about a minute or so to boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me—have you had any storms in your area recently? Any outages that you're aware of?

Customer: No, not that I know of. The weather's been fine all day. Can I check my phone to see if the internet's back yet?

Agent: Sure, go ahead and check.

Customer: (pause) Nope. Still nothing. The light's still red.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm showing that we don't have any reported outages in your area at this time. Let me ask you this—do you have a modem separate from your router, or is it all in one unit?

Customer: I think it's all in one. I mean, that's the only box I have besides the router.

Agent: Ah, okay so you have a combined unit. That's helpful. Can you tell me what lights are on the Astera2 right now?

Customer: (pause) Um, there's a red light on top, and then... I think there's like an orange light below it? And everything else is dark.

Agent: Okay, so if the main light is red and you're seeing an orange secondary light, that usually means the device is still trying to establish a connection to our network. (pause) Can you check the back of that unit for me? Is there a coaxial cable connected to it? It'll be a thick cable.

Customer: Yeah, there's definitely a cable back here. It looks like it's pretty secure though.

Agent: Good. Actually, let me try something different. I'm going to send a signal reset to your device from here. This should take about two minutes to process. Can you just wait on the line with me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. No problem.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I've sent that through. Let's just... give it about ninety seconds here.

Customer: (background noise, pause) ...

Agent: Still there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here. Just watching it.

Agent: Any change on the lights yet?

Customer: Uh... no. It's still the same. Red and orange.

Agent: Okay. (pause) I'm actually going to have you try one more thing for me. Can you hold on just one second? I want to check the line status on your account to see if there's maybe something on our end that's disconnected.

Customer: Sure, go ahead.

Agent: (longer pause, typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your line and... actually, I'm seeing that your service should be active. That's strange. Have you checked whether the coaxial cable might be loose? Sometimes if it's not hand-tightened properly, it can cause connection issues.

Customer: You want me to try tightening it?

Agent: Yes, please. If you could gently unscrew it and then screw it back in by hand. Don't overtighten it.

Customer: (sounds of movement, slight strain) Okay... (pause) it doesn't really feel like it was that loose, but I tightened it up. Nothing's changed though.

Agent: Hmm. Let me just... (typing sounds, pause) one moment. Let me try the reset one more time, actually. Sometimes it takes a couple of attempts.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, sending another signal reset now. Why don't we give this... five minutes this time? I want to make sure the device has enough time to fully recycle.

Customer: Five minutes? Alright. (pause) So like... is this something that's probably just with my equipment then, or is it something on your guys' end?

Agent: That's what we're trying to determine. Right now, my system shows your line is active and provisioned correctly, so it could be either a device issue or potentially something with the connection between our network and your location. The reset should help narrow that down. (pause) Are you still seeing those same lights?

Customer: Yeah, red and orange. Same as before.

Agent: (pause) Okay. You know what, while we're waiting on that reset, let me see if I can have a technician come out. I want to be transparent with you—we might need someone to physically come to your location to diagnose this. But let me give the device a few more minutes first, alright?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. I mean, at this point I'm willing to do whatever.

Agent: I understand. (long pause) How much time do you have to deal with this today?

Customer: I mean, I work from home, so this is kind of a big deal. But I can stay on if you need me to.

Agent: I appreciate that. Alright, we're almost at that five-minute mark. Can you check the device one more time for me?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Still red and orange. No change.

Agent: (sigh) Okay. Unfortunately, at this point, we've done the standard troubleshooting steps and the device isn't responding the way I'd expect it to. I think we're going to need to get a technician out to your location to take a look at the actual line and the equipment.

Customer: Really? How long does that take? Can someone come out today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability... (pause) I'm seeing that we do have a slot available tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean... (pause) I guess that's the earliest?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. I apologize for that. We're pretty booked up today. But our technician should be able to resolve whatever the issue is once they get out there.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, tomorrow should work. What else do I need to do in the meantime?

Agent: Go ahead and leave that equipment powered on for now. Don't unplug it or anything. Our technician will likely want to see what state it's in when they arrive. I'm going to go ahead and schedule that appointment for you, and you should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes with all the details.

Customer: Alright. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll just... wait for the technician tomorrow I guess.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
