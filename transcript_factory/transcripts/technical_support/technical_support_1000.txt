# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I work from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at... let me see... account for Michael Torres at 4521 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So your internet's been down since this morning, you said?

Customer: Right, yeah. I woke up around 6 AM and tried to check my email, and nothing. Just no connection at all. I've been without it for like... six hours now, maybe longer.

Agent: Okay, I'm really sorry about that. Let me ask you a few quick questions so I can figure out what's going on. First, are you using a modem and router that we provided, or do you have your own equipment?

Customer: Um, I think it's yours. It's that white box thing, and then there's a separate router next to it.

Agent: Great, so you've got our modem and a separate router. That's helpful. Now, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on the front of the modem right now?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... I'm looking at it now. The power light is on, it's green. And then there's... there's one that's blinking, I think it's orange or red?

Agent: Alright, alright, so the power is on but you've got a red or orange light blinking. That usually indicates there's either no signal coming into the modem or there's an issue with the connection from our end. Do you know if there have been any storms in your area recently, or any construction work near your house?

Customer: No storms that I know of. But actually, now that you mention it, there were some utility workers digging around my yard yesterday. Is that... could that have something to do with it?

Agent: That could absolutely be it, yeah. They might have damaged the line coming into your house. But let's try a few things first before we jump to that conclusion, okay?

Customer: Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

Agent: So what I want you to do is unplug the modem from the power source. Just pull the cord right out of the wall.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about thirty seconds. Just give it a little reboot. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in... okay, it's in.

Agent: Perfect. Now we're gonna let it boot back up. That should take about two to three minutes. While we wait, let me ask you... when you try to connect, are you seeing the Wi-Fi network at all?

Customer: No, I can't even see the network. That's the thing. Usually I can see like three or four different networks, but right now I just... nothing.

Agent: Okay, so no Wi-Fi at all. (typing sounds) And you're not connected via ethernet either, I'm guessing?

Customer: No, I've only got the Wi-Fi.

Agent: Alright. Well, give it another minute or so. The modem should be powering up. (pause) Actually, while we're waiting... what are you seeing on the modem now? Any change in those lights?

Customer: Um... the power light is still green, but that other light... I think it might be yellow now? It was red or orange before, but now it looks a little lighter.

Agent: Yellow is good, that's progress. (pause) Okay, so the modem should be connecting to our network now. Can you check your phone or any other device and see if the Wi-Fi shows up?

Customer: (pause) Oh! Okay, yeah, I see it now. The Wi-Fi is back. Let me try to... (pause) okay, connecting now...

Agent: Great, great. So you're connecting to the Wi-Fi?

Customer: Yeah, I'm connected, but... wait. It's saying "no internet." Like, I'm connected to the network but there's no actual internet coming through.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's... that's different. So you're getting the Wi-Fi signal but no actual data. Let me check your modem status here. (typing sounds, longer pause) Hmm, I'm seeing that your modem is still showing as offline on our end. That's the issue. It's not registering on the network.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is that something I can fix, or...?

Agent: Well, let's try a couple more things. Can you check the back of the modem? There should be a cable going into it from the wall. It's usually a thick coaxial cable. Can you make sure it's nice and tight?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the back. Yeah, I see it. Let me... (pause) ...it seems pretty tight already. Should I try unplugging it and plugging it back in?

Agent: Actually, yeah, go ahead and do that. Just make sure it's snug when you plug it back in. Sometimes they can loosen up over time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugged... and... plugging back in. (pause) Yeah, it's in there pretty good now.

Agent: Alright. Give it a moment to re-sync. (pause) Are you still seeing that "no internet" message?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, still the same. Still no internet.

Agent: Okay, I'm gonna check on a few things on my end. (longer pause, typing sounds) So I'm looking at your service address and I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, so that's good news. But what I am seeing is that your modem hasn't registered on our network for about... (pause) ...looks like about eight hours now. That would line up with this morning when you first noticed it.

Customer: Right, yeah. So what does that mean?

Agent: (pause) Well, like I mentioned earlier, it could be the line that got damaged by those utility workers. Or, it could be an issue with the modem itself. (pause) Let me try one more thing. I'm gonna send a signal to your modem from our end, and that might help it reconnect.

Customer: Okay, okay, do it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I've sent that signal. Let's wait about thirty seconds and see if anything changes on your modem. Are you watching the lights?

Customer: Yeah, I'm watching them. (pause) ...Nothing's changing. Still the same yellow light. The power's still green.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I've gotta be honest with you, Michael. At this point, I think we might be dealing with either a line issue or a modem hardware failure. Both of those are beyond what I can troubleshoot over the phone.

Customer: So what's my next step? I really need to get this working. I've got a meeting at two o'clock and I need the internet working by then.

Agent: Yeah, I totally understand. What I'm gonna do is schedule a technician to come out to your place. They can check the line coming into your house—especially given that work that was done yesterday—and they can also test the modem to see if it's a hardware issue.

Customer: Okay, yeah. When can they come out? How soon?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. (pause) The earliest I can get someone out there is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Tomorrow? I need it today. I have this meeting at two and I really—

Agent: I completely understand, and I wish I had same-day availability. Let me check one more time... (pause) ...I'm not seeing anything available today, unfortunately. Our technicians are pretty booked up. But I can make a note on your account that this is urgent and see if we can get you pushed up in the queue. Sometimes we have cancellations.

Customer: Alright, fine. Yeah, schedule the appointment for tomorrow morning then. Hopefully that works out. Can I at least get a credit or something for this outage?

Agent: That's a great question. (pause) So typically we can offer a credit for the outage time. I can definitely put in a note for that. I'm gonna apply a one-day service credit to your account right now as a goodwill gesture, and then once the technician gets out there and resolves the issue, the system will automatically credit you for the full outage period.

Customer: Okay. I guess that's something. What's the confirmation number for the service call?

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, your appointment confirmation number is... 7-3-5-2-9-2. That's 7-3-5-2-9-2. And you'll get a call from the technician tomorrow morning confirming the time window, probably around 7 or 8 AM.

Customer: Got it. I wrote it down. So to recap, no internet today, technician coming tomorrow, and I'm getting a credit?

Agent: That's right. And again, I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. I know it's a huge inconvenience, especially when you work from home. Hopefully the tech can get you back up and running tomorrow morning, and we can figure out if this is a line issue or a modem problem.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, I guess. I hope they can fix it quickly.

Agent: Me too. Hey, before you go, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Alright, well thanks for calling Frontier, Michael, and again, I apologize for the trouble. We really appreciate your business, and we'll get this sorted out for you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
