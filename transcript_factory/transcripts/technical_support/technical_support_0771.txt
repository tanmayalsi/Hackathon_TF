Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. My internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls coming up in like an hour.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here so we can get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's under David Chen.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it, David. Okay, so you're saying your internet went down this morning. When exactly did you notice it stopped working?

Customer: Uh, I'd say around 7 AM? I tried to check my emails and nothing was loading. I waited a bit thinking maybe it was just a blip, but it's been like three hours now.

Agent: Alright, let's try to troubleshoot this. First, I need you to take a look at your modem and router for me. Can you tell me what color lights you're seeing on those devices?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, so... the modem's in the other room. Hold on. (footsteps in background)

Agent: No problem, take your time.

Customer: Okay, so on the modem I'm seeing... the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light is red.

Agent: The internet light is red. Okay, that's helpful information. And what about your router? Can you check that for me too?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the router's right here. Um, it looks like the power light is on but I don't see an internet light. Actually, wait—it's kind of... it's not really lighting up much at all. It looks pretty dark.

Agent: The router's not lighting up much. Gotcha. What I'd like you to do first is unplug the modem from the power outlet for about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. This will help us reset it. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Sure, unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we're waiting, let me ask—have you made any changes to your setup recently? Any new equipment, or have you moved things around?

Customer: No, no, nothing like that. Everything's been the same for like six months.

Agent: Okay, good. And have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: First time, I think. I mean, we've had good service up until now.

Agent: That's good. Alright, go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about two minutes for it to fully boot up. While it's doing that, can you tell me if you're seeing any unusual activity outside? Any construction, work on lines, anything like that?

Customer: (pause) No, everything looks normal outside.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Give it just a moment more... Okay, now take another look at those lights on the modem. What are you seeing?

Customer: Um... the power light is still green, but the internet light is still red. And it's not blinking or anything, it's just solid red.

Agent: Still solid red. That's... (pause) okay. A solid red internet light typically indicates either a connection issue on our end or an issue with the line coming into your home. Let me try a few more things. First, can you check if all the cables running into your modem are tightly connected? There should be a coax cable coming in from outside.

Customer: Yeah, I'm checking. (pause) I see the cable. It looks like it's... it's pretty tight, I think.

Agent: Can you try unplugging that coax cable and then plugging it back in? Sometimes they can come loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it... and plugging it back in. Should I wait again?

Agent: Yeah, let's give it about thirty seconds to a minute.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Still red though. The light's still red.

Agent: Still red. Alright, David, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your account here... I'm actually seeing some issues with the signal levels coming into your location. The downstream power levels are lower than they should be.

Customer: What does that mean? Is that something I can fix?

Agent: Unfortunately, that's typically something on our infrastructure side. It could be a loose connection at the tap, or potentially an issue with the line coming to your house. (pause) I'm going to be honest with you—this is beyond basic troubleshooting. I think we need to get a technician out to your location to physically check the line.

Customer: (frustrated) Are you serious? I have work stuff happening today. Can someone come out today?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) I'm showing we have a technician available... it looks like we could get someone out there between 1 and 3 PM today. Would that window work for you?

Customer: I guess it has to. I don't really have a choice here, do I?

Agent: I know it's not ideal. Look, we'll get someone out there this afternoon, and they should be able to diagnose exactly what the issue is. It could be something simple once they get eyes on it.

Customer: (hesitant) Okay... yeah, alright. One to three PM. What's the address they'll be coming to?

Agent: (typing sounds) The address on file is 447 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you'll be home between 1 and 3 PM?

Customer: I'll make sure I am. When will I get confirmation or anything?

Agent: You should receive a text message within the next hour confirming the appointment and providing the technician's information. Is the phone number we have on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, 555-0147 is my cell.

Agent: Great. (pause) I really am sorry about this, David. I know it's frustrating, especially when you have work commitments. The technician will be able to get to the bottom of this though.

Customer: (sigh) Alright. I guess I'll just have to use my phone's hotspot for now if I need to work.

Agent: That's a good workaround. And David, if you need anything else or if you don't receive that text message within an hour, feel free to call us back, okay?

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. We appreciate your patience and your business with Frontier. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
