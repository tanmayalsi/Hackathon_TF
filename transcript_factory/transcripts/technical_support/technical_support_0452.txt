# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got work calls scheduled in like an hour and I really need to get this figured out.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Yeah, it's... uh... (pause) 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: Great, Michael. I've got your account here. I'm seeing you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Scottsdale area, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Okay, so you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Just to confirm, you're not getting any connection at all right now, correct?

Customer: Right, nothing. I tried unplugging the router and the modem and waiting like ten minutes, but when I plugged them back in, still nothing. The modem isn't even showing any lights.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful info. The fact that there are no lights at all tells me it might be a power issue. So when you have the modem unplugged, can you check the power adapter for me? Just look at the end that plugs into the wall outlet and see if the LED indicator on it is lit up at all?

Customer: Uh, hold on... (pause, background noise of movement) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. I don't see any light on it.

Agent: Okay, so we might have a power adapter issue. Let me have you try plugging it into a different outlet—maybe one on the other side of the room or in another room altogether. Some outlets can be on faulty circuits. Can you try that for me?

Customer: (pause, background noise) Okay, I'm plugging it in to an outlet in my kitchen. (pause) Nope, still nothing. The light's not coming on.

Agent: Alright, so that's not working either. Let me ask you—do you have any other devices you can plug into that kitchen outlet just to verify it's working? Like a lamp or a phone charger?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, let me... (pause) I'm plugging in my phone charger. (pause) Yeah, that's working fine. The outlet's good.

Agent: Okay, so the outlet is working, but the power adapter isn't drawing power. Unfortunately, that usually means the adapter itself is bad. So here's what we can do. I can either send you a replacement adapter—that would take about 3 to 5 business days—or we have a same-day service appointment option available if you need internet before then. What works better for you?

Customer: Okay, so... wait. You're saying the modem is fine, it's just the power adapter?

Agent: Yeah, that's what it's pointing to at this point. The modem itself could still be fine, it's just not getting power. But I do want to try one more thing before we go down the replacement route. Can you unplug the power adapter from the modem itself and then plug it back in really firmly? Sometimes the connection can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that now... (pause) Still nothing. No lights.

Agent: Alright, I figured we'd try. Yeah, so the adapter's definitely the issue here. Now, I should mention—even though we can send you a replacement, you might actually have faster luck checking if Best Buy or another electronics store nearby has a compatible adapter. Sometimes they do. The specs are going to be on the label on the adapter itself, or I can read them to you. Do you want me to look that up?

Customer: Wait, but I'm a customer with Frontier. Shouldn't you be able to just... I don't know, overnight this to me or something? I really can't wait five days. I need internet tomorrow for work meetings.

Agent: (pause) I completely understand, and I appreciate that frustration. Unfortunately, for equipment replacements, our standard shipping is 3 to 5 business days. We don't have an overnight option for power adapters. However, like I mentioned, the same-day technician visit is available. That service would be $75 for the appointment, and they'd bring a replacement adapter with them. Would that work for you?

Customer: $75? For a power adapter? That doesn't seem right. This is your equipment that failed.

Agent: You know, that's a fair point, and I hear you. Let me see if there's anything I can do on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) Unfortunately, the same-day service appointment does carry that fee, but let me check with my supervisor for just one moment to see if there are any options available. Can you hold for just a couple minutes?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Fine.

Agent: Thank you. (hold music plays briefly) (pause, typing sounds)

Agent: Michael? Thanks for holding.

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Okay, so I spoke with my supervisor, and I'm able to waive the service fee on the same-day appointment. So a technician can come out today or tomorrow—whichever works better for you—and bring the replacement adapter at no charge. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh, okay. That's... that's better. Yeah, today would be ideal if that's possible.

Agent: Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) Looks like we can get someone out to you between 1 and 4 PM today. Does that window work?

Customer: Actually, wait. Before I commit to this, can we just triple-check that it's definitely the adapter? Like, is there any other troubleshooting I can do?

Agent: (pause) That's a good question. Um... (pause, typing) Let me think. So we've verified the outlet is working, we've confirmed the adapter has no power indicator at all, and we've reseated the connection. Those are pretty much the standard steps. The only other thing would be if you happen to have access to another compatible power adapter to test with, but I don't imagine you do?

Customer: No, I don't. I mean, my laptop charger is different, and I'm not gonna risk frying anything.

Agent: Right, I wouldn't recommend that anyway. Yeah, so based on everything we've gone through, I'm pretty confident it's the power adapter. I've seen this situation quite a bit, honestly. So I'd say go ahead with the same-day appointment. Should I get that booked for you between 1 and 4 PM today?

Customer: (pause) ...Yeah, okay. Let's do it.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get some information. What's the best phone number to reach you if the technician needs to contact you?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account.

Agent: (typing) Great. And just to confirm the address... I've got 2847 Maple Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona 85251. Is that right?

Customer: Yep, that's correct.

Agent: Excellent. So you're all set for today between 1 and 4 PM. The technician will have a replacement power adapter. You should receive a confirmation text message within the next few minutes with the appointment details. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: (pause) I guess... I mean, my internet should work once they replace the adapter, right? You're sure about that?

Agent: Based on everything we've troubleshot, yes, I'm very confident. The modem itself is functioning fine, it's just not getting power. Once the adapter is replaced, you should be good to go. But if for some reason the internet still isn't working after the technician leaves, they'll be able to do some additional troubleshooting on site, and you can always call us back.

Customer: Okay. Alright, well, I guess I'll see what happens. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. And again, I apologize for the inconvenience today. We appreciate your patience and your business with Frontier. You have a great day.

Customer: Yeah, you too.

Agent: Thank you. Bye.

Customer: Bye.
