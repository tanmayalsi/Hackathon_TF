Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get your name?

Customer: It's Michael. Michael Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got you here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Did anything happen before it went down? Like a storm, or did you restart anything?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I was just working from home, and then around nine o'clock this morning I noticed I couldn't access anything. All the lights on my router are still on, so I don't know... I thought maybe it was just a service issue in my area?

Agent: That's good information. Let me check for any outages in your area first. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any active outages reported for your zip code. So let's do some basic troubleshooting. Can you tell me where your modem and router are located right now?

Customer: They're both in my office. They're sitting on a shelf next to my desk.

Agent: Great. And you mentioned the lights are on. Can you describe what you're seeing on the modem? Are all the lights solid, or are any of them blinking?

Customer: Um... (pause) yeah, there's a few lights. One's green and solid, and then there's like a... I think it's a red one that's blinking?

Agent: Okay, so which light is red and blinking? Is it the internet light, or...?

Customer: I'm not really sure, Derek. There's just... there's several lights on here. One says "Internet" but I'm not sure if that's the one that's blinking.

Agent: No problem, no problem. Um, typically the Internet light should be solid green if everything's working properly. If it's red or blinking, that usually indicates a connection issue. Let's try a hard restart. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Sure, how do I do that?

Agent: Okay, so first unplug the modem—that's the device that came from Frontier. Don't unplug the router yet, just the modem.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about thirty seconds while it powers down completely.

Customer: (pause) Alright, waiting.

Agent: Perfect. And while we're waiting, how long have you been a Frontier customer, Michael?

Customer: Oh, maybe about two years now? Yeah, around two years.

Agent: Nice. Okay, and you haven't had any issues before this?

Customer: No, it's actually been pretty solid. This is the first real problem I've had.

Agent: Good to know. Alright, thirty seconds should be up. Go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's back in. (pause) I can see the lights coming back on.

Agent: Good. This usually takes about a minute or two to fully boot up. While we wait, let me ask—are you able to see your WiFi network on your phone or computer?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, actually I can see it. The WiFi network is showing up.

Agent: Okay, that's good. That means the router is functioning. Let's give it another twenty seconds or so for the modem to fully establish the connection. (pause) Alright, now try opening a web page on your computer or phone. What happens?

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) Um... nothing. It's just... it's stuck loading. It won't go anywhere.

Agent: Okay. And do you see the Internet light now? Is it still red or blinking?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's still blinking red.

Agent: Alright. That's indicating that the modem isn't connecting to our network. Let me try pushing a signal to your modem to see if that helps. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I've sent a signal. Can you give that about thirty seconds and then try loading a webpage again?

Customer: (pause, longer pause) Okay, trying now... (pause) No, it's still not working. Same thing.

Agent: Hmm, alright. Let's try unplugging the router as well now. Let's do a full reset of both devices.

Customer: Okay. (sounds of movement, pause) Both are unplugged now.

Agent: Good. Let's wait about forty-five seconds this time to make sure everything fully powers down. (pause)

Customer: So um, do you think there's an issue with my equipment, or is it something on Frontier's end?

Agent: Well, that's what we're trying to narrow down. If it was an area outage, we would've seen that in the system. And since your modem isn't establishing a connection, it could be a few things—either the modem itself, or a line issue on our end. We should know more once we get this restarted.

Customer: Okay, makes sense.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first, and then wait about thirty seconds before plugging the router back in.

Customer: (sounds of plugging) Okay. (pause, pause) Alright, router's back in. (pause) I'm giving it a minute.

Agent: (pause) Try now.

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) No... still nothing. Still loading and nothing's happening. And the Internet light is still blinking red.

Agent: (pause) Okay, Michael, let me try something else. When you look at the modem, are there any other indicator lights? Like, is there a power light, a downstream or upstream light?

Customer: There's... there's a lot of lights. I see green ones, I see a couple that might be blinking. [inaudible] ...yeah, there's definitely like... it looks like there's activity happening but I don't know what it means.

Agent: Right, okay. Do you have the model number of your modem? It should be on a sticker on the back or bottom.

Customer: (pause, sounds of movement) Let me see... (pause) Um, I think it says... Arris? And then some numbers... SB8200?

Agent: Okay, so you have the Arris SB8200. That's a good modem. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm seeing that your device is showing as offline in our system, which confirms that we're not establishing a connection on our end. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it the modem?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be the modem, or it could be an issue with the line coming into your house. Have you noticed any damage to the cable outside, or any work being done in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Everything looks fine from what I can see.

Agent: Okay. Um, let me try one more thing. I'm going to restart your connection from our end and see if that brings the modem back online. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I've reset your connection. Can you give it about two minutes to re-establish and then try again?

Customer: (pause) So I just... wait?

Agent: Yeah, just give it a couple minutes. That signal should push through and hopefully reconnect your modem.

Customer: (pause, pause) Alright, it's been a couple minutes. Should I try now?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and try loading a page.

Customer: (pause, typing sounds, longer pause) Still nothing, Derek. I'm really not getting anything. The light's still blinking red.

Agent: (sigh) Okay. Unfortunately, Michael, at this point we've gone through the standard troubleshooting steps and the modem still isn't connecting. It's still showing as offline in our system, which means there's either a hardware issue with your modem or there's a line issue on our end that I'm not able to diagnose over the phone.

Customer: So what do I do?

Agent: Well, I have a couple of options for you. The first would be to schedule a technician to come out and check your line and equipment. That usually takes two to five business days depending on our availability. Or, if you want, we could also send you a replacement modem to see if that's the issue. That typically arrives within three to five business days as well.

Customer: How long would a tech visit take?

Agent: Usually a technician appointment is about two hours. They'll come out, check the line coming into your house, replace the modem if needed, and make sure everything's working properly.

Customer: And if it's the modem that's the problem, I could just do the replacement instead and avoid the wait?

Agent: Well, that's possible, but if there's a line issue, the replacement modem won't solve it. With a technician visit, they can identify the root cause and fix it on the spot. That's usually the faster solution overall.

Customer: Okay, um... I really need my internet working soon. Can you get a technician out here tomorrow or the next day?

Agent: Let me check availability. (pause, typing sounds, pause) I'm looking at our schedule, and unfortunately the earliest I can get someone out there is Thursday afternoon. Would that work for you?

Customer: Thursday? That's three days away. I work from home, Derek. I really can't be without internet that long.

Agent: I completely understand, Michael. I know this is frustrating. Unfortunately, that's the soonest availability we have in your area. Is Thursday afternoon workable, or would you prefer a different day?

Customer: (pause) I mean... I guess Thursday is better than waiting longer. What time?

Agent: The window is between two and five PM. I can note that you need to be there during that window, and the technician will call or text you before arriving.

Customer: Okay, fine. Thursday between two and five.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I have a technician appointment scheduled for this Thursday, [inaudible], between two and five PM. Your service address is 447 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation email and text within the next couple hours. Is there anything else I can help you with while we wait for the appointment?

Customer: No, I think that's... I mean, I'm frustrated but that's all I can do I guess. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today, Michael. The technician should be able to identify and fix the issue when they come out. You'll have a reference number for this call—it's 8847952—just in case you need to reference anything. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's everything.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, Michael. Have a good day, and we'll get you back online soon.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
