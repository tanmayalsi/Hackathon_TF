Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've tried unplugging everything and plugging it back in, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. And can I get your name, please?

Customer: It's Marcus. Marcus Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Marcus. Thanks for that. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have there been any storms in your area, or do you know if there's been any construction work nearby?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine last night. I woke up this morning, tried to check my email, and... nothing. I mean, I tried rebooting the modem and the router like I usually do when this happens, but this time it didn't come back.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Let me check your account here. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area at the moment, so let's do some troubleshooting on your end. Can you walk me through what you see right now? Is the modem powered on?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. The lights are on. I see the blue light... and the green one.

Agent: Good, so you're seeing power and connection lights. That's a start. Now, can you tell me if any of those lights are blinking or solid?

Customer: Um... (pause) they're both solid. They're not blinking.

Agent: Alright, and what about your router? Is that powered on as well?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, the router's on too. It's got lights on it, but... I don't know, this one's been acting weird. Some of the lights keep blinking.

Agent: Okay, which lights are blinking? Can you describe them for me?

Customer: Like... the WiFi light, I think? And maybe one more. It's hard to tell. I don't really know what all these lights mean, to be honest.

Agent: (chuckles) That's completely understandable. Most people don't. The WiFi light blinking usually means it's trying to establish a connection. Here's what I'd like you to do—can you unplug the modem from power? Just pull the cord out completely.

Customer: Okay... (pause) it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about 30 seconds. (pause) Just give it a moment there...

Customer: Yeah, okay. I'm counting... (pause) thirty, yeah?

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in and we'll let it boot up. This should take about two to three minutes.

Customer: Alright, it's plugging back in now. (background noise) So we're just... waiting?

Agent: Exactly. While we wait, let me ask you a couple more questions. Have you made any changes to your setup recently? New devices, anything like that?

Customer: No, not really. Same setup I've had for like six months. My laptop, my phone, my smart TV... same stuff.

Agent: Got it. And you're able to see your network name in the available WiFi networks, or are you not seeing anything?

Customer: I don't see anything. Usually I can find "Frontier-Guest" or whatever, but right now... nothing. It's like the WiFi just disappeared.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm, okay. Let's give that modem another minute or so. (pause) Is it starting to light up again?

Customer: Oh yeah, I see the lights coming back on now. The modem lights are solid again—both of them.

Agent: Excellent. Now give it another 30 seconds or so and then check your WiFi networks again, okay?

Customer: (pause) Okay... still nothing. No networks showing up at all. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I understand. Let me try a few more things. Can you hold on for just one moment while I pull up some additional information here?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (hold music plays for about 20 seconds)

Agent: Thanks for holding. Okay, Marcus, I'm going to have you do a factory reset on your modem. I know that sounds intimidating, but it's pretty simple. Do you see a small reset button on the back of the modem?

Customer: Um... let me look. (pause) Yeah, I think so. There's a little hole here with "reset" written next to it.

Agent: That's the one. Now, I'll warn you—this is going to clear everything and we might need to set things back up, but let's try it. You'll need a paperclip or something small and thin to press it.

Customer: (background noise) Hold on... yeah, I've got a paperclip. Do I just... poke it in there?

Agent: Exactly. Press it and hold it for about 15 seconds. You'll probably see the lights flicker.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm doing it... (pause) ...and holding... the lights are going crazy. Okay, releasing now.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about five minutes and let it fully reset and reboot. While we wait, can I get the model number of your modem? It should be on a sticker on the bottom or back.

Customer: (pause) It says... FR-1200? I think? FR-1200-C-OH?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, FR-1200. That's good. That's one of our standard models. Alright, has the modem finished its startup yet?

Customer: Um... the lights are still doing something. Blinking and stuff. (pause) Okay, now they're solid again. Both lights are solid.

Agent: Perfect. Now check your WiFi networks again.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. I don't... I don't see anything. No networks at all.

Agent: (sigh) Alright. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds, longer pause) Marcus, I'm looking at your modem and I'm not seeing it communicating with our network at this point. That's... that's unusual.

Customer: So like... what does that mean? Is it broken?

Agent: It could be a few things. It might be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or there could be a line issue. Since the factory reset didn't help, and the lights are indicating power but not connection, I'm thinking we might need to get a technician out to your location to do a full diagnostic. They'd be able to check the line coming into your house and potentially replace the modem if needed.

Customer: So you can't fix it over the phone?

Agent: Unfortunately, at this point, it doesn't look like we can resolve this remotely. I'm really sorry about that. The good news is we can get someone out to you pretty quickly. When would be a good time for a visit?

Customer: This week would be best. Like, whenever you have an opening.

Agent: Let me check our schedule here. (typing sounds, pause) We have availability... looks like Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM, or Friday morning between 8 and 12. Which works better for you?

Customer: Thursday afternoon is probably better.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get you scheduled with a technician for Thursday afternoon. I'm getting you confirmation number 447821. The technician will come by and diagnose the issue. If it's the modem, we'll swap it out at no charge. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, okay. I mean, I'm not happy about losing internet for days, but I guess that's what I gotta do.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully the technician can figure it out.

Agent: We'll get this taken care of for you. Your confirmation number again is 447821. You should receive a text and an email with the appointment details. Is the number on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Great. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, Marcus. We appreciate your business, and I apologize for the inconvenience today.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a good day.
