# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I've got work I need to do and it's really frustrating.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm showing an account for a David Martinez at 412 Elm Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you have any lights on your modem and router right now?

Customer: Um, let me go look. (pause) Okay, so the modem... it's got a red light on it. And the router next to it looks like it's off or something. There's no lights on it at all.

Agent: Alright, so we've got a red light on the modem, which typically indicates no connection or an error state. And your router has no lights. Let's start with the basics. Can you check and make sure both devices are plugged in securely?

Customer: Yeah, they're plugged in. I can see the power cords going into both of them.

Agent: Good. Now, I'm going to have you do a power cycle. First, can you unplug the modem from the power outlet?

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. Leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. While we're waiting, can you also unplug the router?

Customer: Done. How much longer?

Agent: Just about... (pause) go ahead and count to thirty out loud if that helps.

Customer: (counting) One... two... three... four... five... (continues counting) ...twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. (pause) Alright, I'm seeing some lights now. There's a green light and an orange light starting to blink.

Agent: Excellent. That's a good sign. Now plug the router back in.

Customer: Doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's in. (pause) Alright, I'm seeing lights on the router now too. There's a blue light in the middle and... yeah, there's a couple lights.

Agent: Okay, good. Give it about two to three minutes to fully boot up. These lights should stabilize. While we're waiting, let me check if there are any service issues in your area. (typing sounds) Can you also check if you're getting a WiFi signal on your phone or computer? Just look for Frontier networks available?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking... I see "FrontierGuest" and... I don't see my network name yet. Still booting up probably?

Agent: That's likely it, yeah. Give it another minute. Did you try connecting your computer directly to the modem with an ethernet cable, by any chance?

Customer: Uh, I don't have one handy. I was just using WiFi.

Agent: Alright, that's fine. Let's wait a minute and then try looking for your network again.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking again. I still... I still don't see my personal network. Just the guest one. This is weird.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. What color are the lights on your modem now? Let me know what you're seeing.

Customer: Um, there's a green light, and it looks like the internet light is... it's orange now? Or maybe amber? One of those colors.

Agent: Okay, so the orange light on the internet indicator usually means either there's no signal coming into the modem, or there's a connectivity issue. Let me check your service status here. (typing sounds) Are you seeing any service alerts or anything unusual in your area that you're aware of?

Customer: Not that I know of. The internet was working fine yesterday.

Agent: Right. Okay. The system is showing that your line should be active and there are no service interruptions reported in your area. This might be a deeper connectivity issue with your modem or router. Have you tried unplugging just the modem again and leaving it longer? Sometimes thirty seconds isn't quite enough.

Customer: Really? How much longer should I try?

Agent: Let's try a full minute this time. Go ahead and unplug the modem again and let it sit for a full sixty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) Should I be waiting on the line or...?

Agent: Yeah, just stay on the line with me. I can hold while you're waiting.

Customer: (pause) Okay. (long pause) Alright, thirty seconds have gone by. (longer pause) ...and it's been about a minute. Should I plug it back in now?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it in. (pause) Alright, I see the lights coming back on... green light first... orange light is blinking again... 

Agent: Okay. Let me check if there have been any recent changes to your account or line. (typing sounds) When was the last time you restarted your router, by the way?

Customer: The router? Uh... I honestly don't remember. Probably like... a month ago? Maybe longer.

Agent: Okay. Once your modem finishes booting up completely, we should also do a restart on the router. And, um, I'm actually seeing something here that might be relevant. It looks like your line shows an offline status in our system, which would explain the orange light. That's unusual because it should be detecting an active signal.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it broken or something?

Agent: It could be a few things. There might be a line issue outside, or there could be something happening with the ONT—that's the optical network terminal that connects Frontier's fiber line to your equipment. It's usually a small box outside your home.

Customer: Oh, there is something outside. Like a box on the side of my house?

Agent: Exactly. Can you go check that? Look for a box that might be white or beige colored, probably about this size (gestures, inaudible). There should be some lights on it.

Customer: (pause) Hold on, I'm going outside. (pause) Okay, I found it. It's on the side of my garage. There's definitely a box here. Um, it's got some lights on it, but... they look red? Or dark red? All of them?

Agent: All of them are red? That's... hmm. So the ONT is showing an error state. The lights should be green if everything is working properly. Are there any wires or cables that look loose or damaged around that box?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... No, everything looks plugged in pretty tight from what I can see. But I mean, I'm not an expert.

Agent: No, I understand. This is actually beyond what I can troubleshoot over the phone with you. The fact that the ONT is showing all red lights and your modem isn't getting a signal suggests there's a line issue, either at the ONT itself, or somewhere between our network and your home.

Customer: So what do I do? Do I need to replace it?

Agent: That's something a technician would need to evaluate. I can definitely schedule a technician visit for you. They can come out and check the ONT, the cabling, and see what's going on with the connection.

Customer: How soon can someone come out? I really need this fixed. I have meetings tomorrow.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. What does your schedule look like? Are you available this week?

Customer: Tomorrow would be ideal, but I can work around it if needed.

Agent: Okay, so I'm looking at our schedule and we have afternoon availability tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works. That should be fine.

Agent: Great. Let me get that scheduled for you. A technician will come by between 1 and 5 PM tomorrow. They'll bring any necessary equipment and should be able to diagnose the issue. In the meantime, there's unfortunately not much we can do to restore your service. I know that's frustrating.

Customer: Yeah, it is. Can I call back if anything changes, or...?

Agent: Absolutely. If your service comes back on for any reason, great, but if you need to reach us before the technician visit, you can always call back or check your account online. Do you have your confirmation number from this call?

Customer: No, um, how do I get that?

Agent: I can read it to you right now. (typing sounds) Your confirmation number is 7849-FNC-2024. I'll also make a note on your account with the technician so they know what we discussed—the red lights on the ONT, the orange light on your modem, everything we've tried so far.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I appreciate you trying to help.

Agent: Of course. I wish I could have gotten you back online tonight, but hopefully the technician will have a quick fix tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
