# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get a name please?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, David. Thank you. So I'm seeing your account here. I do show you have our Fiber 500 service. When exactly did you notice the internet stop working?

Customer: Um, around 7 this morning. I went to check my email and nothing loaded. I restarted my router but that didn't do anything.

Agent: Okay, so you've already done a restart of the router. That's great. I appreciate that. Let me ask you a few more questions here. When you look at your router right now, what color are the lights that you're seeing?

Customer: The lights? Um... (pause) okay, looking at it now. So the power light is green, but the internet light—I think it's the blue one—it's just red. And it's not blinking or anything, it's just... solid red.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, solid red on the internet light. That's helpful information. And David, can you tell me—do you have a modem that's separate from your router, or is it all in one unit?

Customer: I think... I'm not totally sure to be honest. There's the router box and then I have a smaller box connected to it with cables.

Agent: Okay, that smaller box is most likely your modem. Can you check the lights on that one for me? What are you seeing there?

Customer: (pause) The lights on that one are... mostly red too. Some amber colored ones. Nothing is really green except for the power light.

Agent: Okay, I see. So it sounds like there might be a connection issue between the modem and our network. Let me have you do something for me. I want you to unplug the modem first, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. And while that's rebooting, go ahead and do the same with the router. Unplug it, wait 30 seconds, plug it back in.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) So just... wait, do I do them at the same time or one after the other?

Agent: Good question. Let's do the modem first. Go ahead and unplug that now.

Customer: (pause) Done. Unplugged.

Agent: And we're gonna wait 30 seconds. I'll count down for you. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugged in. It's starting up.

Agent: Perfect. While that's booting up, go ahead and unplug the router as well.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugged the router too.

Agent: Alright, and let's wait another 30 seconds before you plug that back in. (pause) While we're waiting, let me ask—have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, no, this is the first time. Internet's been working great up until this morning. I have no idea what happened.

Agent: Alright. Go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged in. Both things are starting back up now.

Agent: Great. This usually takes about a minute or two. Let's give it a moment and then check those lights again.

(pause - approximately 90 seconds)

Agent: David, are we there? Can you see what the lights are showing now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it. Um... (pause) the modem still has that red light. The router is showing... okay, I see a blue light now, which is different. But the internet light is still red.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hm, okay. So the modem is still not connecting properly. Let me pull up your line here and see if I'm showing any connection on our end. (pause) David, I'm not seeing any active connection to your modem right now. That's actually indicating that the modem itself might not be communicating with our network.

Customer: What does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: It could be a few things. It might be an issue with the modem, or there could be a line problem on our end. Let me check something. Do you remember the last time you had any work done on your line? Any technician visits or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. It's just been working.

Agent: Okay. Let me check our system for any service alerts in your area... (typing sounds - pause) I'm not seeing any outages reported right now, but I do want to try something else. Can you look on the back of that modem? I need you to find a button that says "Reset." It might be in a small hole.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I see it. It's like a little recessed button.

Agent: Right, exactly. Now, I want you to hold that button down for about 10 seconds while the modem is powered on. This is going to reset the modem completely, so it's going to take a few minutes to boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it down... (pause) alright, let go. Now what?

Agent: Now we just let it restart. This might take a couple minutes. Let's wait and see what happens with those lights.

(pause - approximately 2 minutes)

Agent: David, you there?

Customer: Yeah, still waiting. It's... okay, I'm starting to see some green lights now on the modem. That's different from before.

Agent: That's a good sign. The green lights mean it's communicating. Let's just give it another minute or so to fully establish the connection.

(pause - approximately 60 seconds)

Customer: Okay, um, I'm looking at it now and... I don't know. The lights are still mostly red again. The green ones went away. This is really frustrating.

Agent: (pause) I understand, David. I know this is frustrating. Look, at this point, I think we might be looking at either a hardware issue with the modem or a line issue on our end that I'm not able to diagnose over the phone. I want to get a technician out to your place to take a look at this. How does that sound?

Customer: How long until someone can come out? I really need my internet back today if possible.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) I can get someone out there today actually. We have an available appointment window between 1 PM and 4 PM today. Does that work for you?

Customer: Today between 1 and 4? Yeah, that works.

Agent: Excellent. I'm going to schedule that for you. The technician will come out and check both the modem and the line to see what's going on. (pause) Okay, David, you're all set. Your appointment is confirmed for today between 1 PM and 4 PM. You should get a confirmation text or email here shortly with a reference number. The tech will have all your information.

Customer: Okay, thanks. So you think it's probably the modem?

Agent: It could be the modem, or it could be something with the line coming into your house. The technician will be able to determine that when he gets there. He might need to replace the modem, or there might be something else going on. But once he's there, you'll be in good hands.

Customer: Alright. Appreciate it.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today, David?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just hoping to get this fixed.

Agent: Absolutely. Thank you for being patient with me while we troubleshot this. We really appreciate your business with Frontier, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Your reference number for the appointment is 847521. Have that ready for the technician.

Customer: Got it. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, David. Have a great day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Goodbye.
