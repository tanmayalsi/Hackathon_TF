Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I work from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... hold on, let me grab my bill. (pause) Okay, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing an account for a residential fiber connection at... is that 412 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember approximately what time?

Customer: It was around 8 AM. I was trying to log into a work call and everything just... stopped. No connection at all. I've restarted the router a couple times but nothing's working.

Agent: Okay, good to know you've already tried restarting. Let me ask you this—when you look at the router, are you seeing any lights on it at all? What color are they?

Customer: Um, yeah, so there's... there's a light on the front, it's blinking orange. Is that bad?

Agent: The orange blinking light typically indicates that the router isn't communicating with our network. That's actually helpful information. What I'd like to do is walk you through a few troubleshooting steps. First, can you locate the modem? That's usually a separate device from the router, kind of a box with more ports on it.

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's sitting right next to the router. Let me look at it. The lights on that one are... the power light is green, and then there's another light that's red. Like, solid red.

Agent: Okay, a solid red light on the modem usually means there's no signal coming from our network to your unit. That tells me this might be a service issue on our end rather than something with your equipment. But let me have you do one more thing—can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And while that's unplugging, let me just double-check our systems here... (typing sounds) I'm looking at your service area and I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported in your neighborhood. Let me have you leave that unplugged for about 30 seconds. Just count it out.

Customer: Okay. (long pause) Alright, it's been about 30 seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. Let me wait for it to boot up... (pause) Okay, so the green light is on, but the red light is still there and the router is still blinking orange.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Alright, let me try something else. I'm going to check if there's maybe an issue with the line coming into your home. Can you go check your network jack on the outside of the house? It might be on the side of your house or the back. It'll look like where the fiber cable connects.

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) I'm not really sure which one that is. There's like a white box on the side of the house?

Agent: Yes, that's likely it. That's the fiber termination box. Can you see if the cables coming out of it look intact? Like, are they plugged in securely?

Customer: I'm looking at it now. Everything looks pretty... I mean, it looks fine to me. The cables look like they're in there pretty tight.

Agent: Okay, good. And you're not seeing any visible damage or anything like that?

Customer: No, no, nothing that I can see.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Well, I'm going to be honest with you—at this point, the troubleshooting steps I can do remotely aren't bringing your connection back. What I'm suspecting is either there's an issue on our network line, or there could be an issue with your modem or the equipment at the network jack. 

Customer: Oh no. So what do we do?

Agent: What I'd like to do is get a technician dispatched out to your location. They'll be able to test the line and check all the equipment. Let me see what availability we have... (typing sounds) I can get someone out there either tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have an afternoon slot from 1 PM to 5 PM.

Customer: It has to be tomorrow? I really need this working today if possible.

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day availability in your area today, but I can mark this as high priority and get someone out first thing tomorrow morning. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, I guess it'll have to. How much is this going to cost me? Is there a service call fee?

Agent: Since we haven't confirmed whether this is an equipment issue or a network issue, the first diagnostic visit is covered at no charge. If it turns out to be something with your modem or equipment, we'd just replace it and there wouldn't be any additional charge. But I want to make sure you know what to expect.

Customer: Okay, okay. So tomorrow between 8 and 12?

Agent: Yes, let me set that up for you. (typing sounds) Perfect. I've got a technician scheduled to arrive at 412 Maple Drive between 8 AM and 12 PM tomorrow. They'll call you 30 minutes before they arrive. Your confirmation number is FR-8847-2914. Do you have a pen?

Customer: Yeah, just a second. (pause) Okay, go ahead.

Agent: It's FR-8847-2914. Can you repeat that back to me?

Customer: FR-8847-2914.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you'll be home tomorrow morning?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here. I don't have much choice, right? (nervous laugh)

Agent: I understand. Hopefully we'll get you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today, but our technician will definitely get you sorted out tomorrow. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a good day.
