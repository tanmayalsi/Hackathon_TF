# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls coming up and I can't get anything to load.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... uh... (pause) 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account. I see you're located in the Scottsdale area. And you're on our fiber plan, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've been with you guys for about two years now and it's usually pretty solid, so this is unusual.

Agent: Good to know. Well, let's see what we can figure out here. First, can you tell me what you're experiencing exactly? Are you getting any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um, so the modem—it's one of those boxes you guys gave me—it has a light that's like... red? I think it's red. And normally it's like, blue or green or whatever, so that's definitely not right.

Agent: Okay, a red light typically indicates a connectivity issue. That's actually helpful information. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Have you tried unplugging the modem yet?

Customer: No, not yet. I wasn't really sure what to do, so I just called you guys.

Agent: That's perfectly fine. That's actually the first thing I'd like to try. So if you can unplug the modem from the wall outlet, just wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. Let me know when you do that.

Customer: (sound of movement, rustling) Okay, give me just a second... (pause) Alright, I'm unplugging it now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And now we'll just let it sit for about thirty seconds. Can you count to thirty or should I count for you?

Customer: I'll count. (pause) Okay, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) The lights are... they're cycling through some different colors now. Red, orange... is that supposed to happen?

Agent: Yes, that's normal. That's the modem booting back up. It should take about a minute or so to fully restart and connect. Let's just give it a minute and then we'll see where we are.

Customer: Alright. (pause) Still cycling... (pause) I think the red is... okay, now I'm seeing like a solid blue light on the left side. Is that good?

Agent: (slight pause) That's... actually, can you describe the lights a little more? How many lights are there and what do they look like?

Customer: Um, there's three of them I think. The left one is blue. The middle one is like blinking orange or amber or something. And the right one is... I don't see anything on the right one.

Agent: Okay, so the middle light blinking amber usually means it's still trying to connect to our network. Let me ask—did you experience any weather in your area last night or early this morning? Any storms or anything like that?

Customer: Oh, actually yeah. We had some heavy rain early this morning around like six or seven AM. Pretty intense for about twenty minutes, and then it cleared up. Could that have something to do with it?

Agent: It absolutely could. Sometimes weather can affect the line coming into your home. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds, longer pause) Alright, I'm looking at our network diagnostics for your area. I'm actually showing that there were some line issues reported this morning around that time. So that could definitely be related.

Customer: Oh okay, so it might clear up on its own then?

Agent: Well, that's what I'm hoping. But I want to keep troubleshooting with you just to be thorough. Can you tell me where your modem is located? Is it near a window or door?

Customer: Uh, it's in my office. It's on a shelf on the wall, but it's not really near a window or anything. It's kind of in the middle of the room.

Agent: That's good actually. Now, are there any lights flashing on your router—that's the separate device if you have one?

Customer: Oh yeah, I do have a separate one. That one's also blinking red or orange, and I can't really tell the difference.

Agent: Alright, so the router is also not connecting. That tells me the issue is definitely upstream. Let me do a quick check of the line. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Sure, yeah.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, about 20 seconds) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I'm showing that the signal coming to your house is pretty weak. It's reading about forty-two percent when it should be closer to ninety or higher. Now, this could be weather-related like we discussed, but I want to rule out a few other things first. Let me ask you, do you have any splitters on your lines?

Customer: Splitters? I'm not really sure what that is, to be honest.

Agent: No problem. Those are basically devices that divide the signal. They're usually small boxes. Have you noticed anything unusual with your cable lines, or have you had any work done at your house recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Everything's been pretty normal. Um, I didn't touch anything or... I mean, we didn't do anything different.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay. Let me check on something. Actually, I'm showing a truck was in your neighborhood yesterday afternoon doing some line maintenance. Sometimes after that work, we need to do a recalibration on individual accounts.

Customer: Oh! That could be it?

Agent: It very well could be. Let me try something here. I'm going to remotely send a reset signal to your modem. This should take about two minutes, and you might see the lights go dark briefly—that's completely normal.

Customer: Okay, I'm watching it... (pause) Yeah, the lights just went out. (pause, longer) Now they're coming back on. The left one's blue again... and the middle one is still blinking orange. (pause) It's still blinking.

Agent: Alright, and how long has it been blinking now?

Customer: Um, maybe like forty-five seconds?

Agent: Okay, let's give it another minute or so. Those reboots can take a little bit longer. (pause) Checking in—is it still blinking?

Customer: Yeah, unfortunately. Same as before. (pause) Still blinking.

Agent: I'm looking at the diagnostics on my end too, and I'm still seeing that weak signal. Alright, look, I think what's happening here is that the weather may have caused some damage to the line coming into your home, or there might be an issue at the point where it connects to our network. This is probably going to require a technician to come out and physically inspect the line.

Customer: Oh... (pause) How long does that typically take? When could someone come out?

Agent: Well, let me check our availability. (typing sounds) What does your schedule look like? Do you have any days in the next week that work for you?

Customer: Um, I mean, I really need this fixed soon. Is there any way someone could come today or tomorrow?

Agent: Let me see... (pause, typing) Unfortunately, we're pretty booked today and tomorrow due to the weather incidents we've been getting calls about. But I can get you scheduled for the day after tomorrow, which would be Thursday. We have a morning window from eight to twelve or an afternoon window from one to five.

Customer: Thursday morning would be good. Eight to twelve is fine.

Agent: Perfect. So I've got you down for Thursday, eight AM to noon, for a technician visit. Can I get a callback number to confirm?

Customer: It's the same number on my account.

Agent: Actually, let me verify that. I have 555-0147?

Customer: No wait, that's my account number. The phone number is... (pause) 555-0198.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it, 555-0198. And that's a cell phone?

Customer: Yes, it's my cell.

Agent: Perfect. So to recap, I've scheduled a technician to visit your home Thursday morning between eight AM and noon. They'll inspect the external line and modem connection to determine if there's any weather-related damage. Is there anything else I can help explain before we wrap up?

Customer: I guess... is there anything I should try between now and Thursday? Like should I keep trying to unplug and plug it back in, or just leave it alone?

Agent: Good question. You can leave it plugged in. If it does happen to connect on its own—which is possible—that would be great. But I wouldn't spend a lot of time troubleshooting it yourself. The technician will have better tools to diagnose what's going on. Just leave it as is, and they'll take it from there.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. And you said they're going to call before they come?

Agent: Yes, they'll actually call you on that cell number we have on file about an hour before they arrive, just to confirm access to your home.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. I appreciate your help with this, even though we couldn't get it working right now.

Agent: I know it's frustrating, but we'll get you back up and running Thursday. My apologies for the inconvenience. Your reference number for this service call is 84629—you might want to write that down. If you need to follow up before Thursday, you can reference that number.

Customer: Okay, I've got it. 84629.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and again, sorry about the outage. Is there anything else I can help with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day, and we'll see you Thursday morning.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
