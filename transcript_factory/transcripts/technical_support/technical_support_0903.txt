# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, just give me one second here. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Morrison. M-O-R-R-I-S-O-N.

Agent: Perfect, thank you James. I'm pulling up your account now. So you're saying your internet is completely down as of this morning?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. I tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in like you guys always say to do, and that didn't work. I'm kind of frustrated because I have work calls scheduled for later today.

Agent: I totally understand. Let me help you get this sorted out. So when you say it's down, are you getting any lights on your modem at all? Any indication that it's getting power?

Customer: Um, let me look. (pause) Yeah, the power light is on, but I'm not seeing the internet light. The internet light isn't on. It's usually like a blue light and it's not lit up.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Is the modem making any sounds? Any beeping or anything like that?

Customer: No, no sounds. It's just... it's quiet. The power light's on but nothing else.

Agent: Alright. And you did unplug it, wait a few seconds, and plug it back in?

Customer: Yeah, I did that like an hour ago. Still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your line here and it's showing that we're not detecting a connection from your modem. So the modem isn't communicating with our network. That could be a few things. Have there been any storms in your area recently? Any power outages?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine. And like I said, the modem has power.

Agent: Right, I hear you. So what I'd like to do is walk you through a few more troubleshooting steps. First, can you check the cables for me? Look at the coaxial cable—that's the one that looks kind of like a TV cable—coming into the modem. Make sure it's screwed on tight.

Customer: (pause) Okay, hold on. (background noise) Yeah, I'm looking at it. It seems pretty tight to me but let me try tightening it anyway. (grunting sounds) Yeah, I got it tighter. Still no light though.

Agent: Okay, that's good that you checked. Now, can you unplug the modem again for me and wait about thirty seconds? And while it's unplugged, we'll give it a hard reset.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) It's unplugged. How long do I wait?

Agent: Just count to thirty if you can. That'll give everything time to discharge.

Customer: (pause, counting softly in background) ...twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. Okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and let me know when you see those lights coming back on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, the power light is back. I see the power light. Um... (pause) ...and now there's like a blinking orange light. Is that normal?

Agent: The blinking orange light means it's trying to establish a connection. That's actually a good sign. Give it about a minute or two to boot back up completely. Sometimes it takes a little while.

Customer: (pause) Okay, waiting. (pause) Still blinking orange. How long should this take?

Agent: It shouldn't take more than a few minutes usually. Let's give it another minute and then check back in, okay?

Customer: (longer pause) Alright, been like two minutes now and it's still just blinking orange. The blue internet light still isn't on.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay, I'm going to place you on a brief hold while I check some things on the network side. It'll just be a moment.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Thanks for waiting, James. Okay, so I'm checking the network here and I'm still not seeing your modem connect. This could indicate a few different things. It might be an issue with the modem itself, or it could be something on the line. Have you had any recent weather events, even minor ones? Sometimes equipment gets damaged and doesn't show obvious signs.

Customer: No, really, nothing. It was working fine yesterday.

Agent: Okay. Let me try one more thing. Can you check behind the modem and make sure the battery backup isn't engaged? Sometimes if there's been a power issue, that kicks in.

Customer: Battery backup? I don't think this modem has... (pause) wait, actually, there's a button here that says... let me see... it says "battery" but it doesn't have any kind of light or indicator. Is that what you mean?

Agent: That could be it. Can you press that button for me?

Customer: (pressing sound) Okay, I pressed it. Still the same thing though. Still blinking orange.

Agent: (pause) Alright, James, I'm going to be honest with you. At this point, we've done the basic troubleshooting—we've reset the modem, we've checked the cables, and the device still isn't connecting to our network. I'm not seeing any signal coming from your location on my end. This is pointing to either a hardware failure with the modem itself or possibly an issue with the line coming into your home.

Customer: So what does that mean? What do I do?

Agent: (pause) Well, I can schedule a technician to come out to your location. They'd be able to physically inspect the modem, the cables, and the line to diagnose exactly what's happening. The first appointment we have available would be... (typing sounds) ...tomorrow between 1 PM and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need internet today. I have calls this afternoon.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize. Unfortunately, our next available technician slot in your area today is fully booked. The soonest we can get someone out is tomorrow. I can put you down as a priority service call so they'll try to come earlier in that window if possible.

Customer: (sighs) This is really frustrating. Is there anything else we can try right now?

Agent: I wish there was something else I could walk you through, but we've pretty much exhausted the remote troubleshooting options. If it's a hardware issue, the modem just needs to be replaced or repaired in person. If you have a smartphone with a data plan, you might be able to use that for your calls as a temporary workaround.

Customer: Yeah, I guess I'll have to do that. Go ahead and schedule the technician.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to get that set up for you. For tomorrow, that's 1 to 5 PM. Can I get a callback number for the technician?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0149.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm your address on file, that's 224 Maple Street, Apartment 3B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Alright, James. I've got you scheduled for tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just hope you can get this fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I hope so too. We'll get someone out to you as quickly as we can. Thanks for being patient with us today, and we apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day, James.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
