Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I work from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help troubleshoot this with you. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Alright, I've got your account. I'm showing you're on our Fiber 200 plan in the Lakewood area. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router? Like, are they powered on?

Customer: Well, the modem... let me check. (pause) Yeah, the modem has some lights on it. There's like a green light and then there's a red one that keeps blinking.

Agent: Okay, so a red blinking light typically indicates a connection issue. That's actually helpful information. Can you tell me which light is red? Is it the internet light, or the power light?

Customer: Um... (pause) I'm not really sure. There's several lights here. Which one should I be looking at?

Agent: No problem. So looking at your modem, there should be a few different lights. One should say "Power," one should say something like "Internet" or "Online," and maybe a couple others. The red blinking light — do you see any labels underneath or near it?

Customer: Let me see... Okay, so the green light says "Power," and then there's this red one that's blinking below it. I can't really make out what it says. The label's kind of worn off.

Agent: Alright. So we've got power, which is good. That red blinking light below that is likely your internet connection light. What I'd like you to do is unplug the modem from the power outlet, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. That's gonna restart it. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, I'm unplugging it now. (pause) Thirty seconds... and... (pause) plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. While that's rebooting, let me ask — have you had any recent storms or anything like that in your area?

Customer: No, not that I know of. It's actually been pretty nice today. Why, does that matter?

Agent: It can sometimes. Storms can affect the connection or even the equipment, so it's good to know. (pause) Okay, so how's the modem looking now? Is it booting back up?

Customer: Yeah, I can see the lights coming back on. The power light's green again. But... (pause) that red light is still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Alright, so the restart didn't clear it. Let me try a couple other things. Can you check your router? You should have a separate device, maybe white or black, and it might have a bunch of antennas on it or might be smaller. Do you see that?

Customer: Oh yeah, I see it. It's right next to the modem. It's like a small black box.

Agent: Perfect. Is that powered on? Can you see any lights on it?

Customer: Um, yeah, there's lights on it too. Those look normal. They're all green.

Agent: Okay, good. So your router seems fine. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) Just give me one second... Okay, I'm not seeing any alerts on your account for service outages in your area, so it's not a widespread thing.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it my equipment?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. The modem might be having an issue, or there could be a problem with the line coming into your home. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you restart your router as well? Just unplug it, wait about thirty seconds, and plug it back in.

Customer: Sure. (pause) Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Thirty seconds... (pause) and plugging back in.

Agent: (pause) Perfect. While that's coming back online, have you tried connecting to the internet yet, like on a computer or phone?

Customer: No, I haven't because obviously the internet's been down since this morning. That's why I called.

Agent: Right, right. Okay, so once the router boots back up — which should take a minute or two — can you try to connect to it and see if you can get online?

Customer: Okay, just... give me a second. The router's booting back up. (pause) Alright, I'm pulling up my laptop. I can see the WiFi network. I'm gonna connect. (pause) Hmm. It's connecting but it's really slow. Like, super slow.

Agent: Okay, so you are getting a connection though?

Customer: Wait, no. It's... it disconnected. That didn't work.

Agent: Alright. Let me try pulling up some diagnostics on my end. (typing sounds) Hmm. Okay, I'm seeing that your modem is connected to our network, which is the good news, but I'm seeing a lot of packet loss, which might explain why the internet light is red.

Customer: Packet... loss? What does that mean?

Agent: It means the data being sent to and from your modem isn't getting through properly. It's like some of the information is getting dropped. (pause) This could indicate either a problem with the modem itself or an issue with the line coming into your home.

Customer: So what do I do?

Agent: Well, we can try a couple more things. First, can you take a look at the cable that's coming into your modem? The coaxial cable — it's the thick cable that screws onto the back of the modem. Make sure it's screwed on tight.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me look... Yeah, it seems pretty tight to me.

Agent: Good. And that cable, where does it come in from?

Customer: It comes from the wall. There's a connector in the wall.

Agent: Alright, can you unscrew it from the modem and just give that connection a quick check? Make sure there's no debris or anything in the connector.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unscrewing it. Let me see... (pause) Looks clean to me. No dirt or anything.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and screw it back on. Make it nice and snug.

Customer: (pause) Okay, done. Now what?

Agent: Now let's give it another minute and see if that red light clears. Sometimes a loose connection can cause that. Can you watch the modem and let me know if that light changes?

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, I'm watching it. Still red though. Still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, it looks like it's not changing. (pause) You know what, I think at this point we might need to escalate this. The packet loss combined with that persistent red light suggests there might be an issue with either the modem itself or the line coming to your house, and I'm not able to fully diagnose that over the phone.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, how long is that gonna take?

Agent: So we have a couple options. I can schedule a technician to come out and check your equipment and the line. The earliest availability I'm showing is... let me see here... (typing sounds) we have tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or Friday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning? Can you do that?

Agent: Yeah, let me get you set up for that. I'll just need to confirm your address and a contact number.

Customer: It's 4782 Maple Street, and you can reach me at 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. So I have you down for a technician visit tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM at 4782 Maple Street. The technician will bring any equipment that might need to be replaced if the modem is the issue. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just really hope this gets fixed tomorrow because I have meetings all day Friday.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll get someone out there to take care of it. In the meantime, if you see any changes with your modem, feel free to give us a call back. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the appointment details.

Customer: Alright, thanks Derek.

Agent: No problem at all. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
