# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it fixed because I'm working from home.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. The account's under David Chen.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, David, I've got your account pulled up here. Let me just verify the service address real quick... Is that 4829 Maple Ridge Drive in Springdale?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet service went down this morning? Walk me through what happened. Were you using it and it just stopped, or...?

Customer: Yeah, I was working, checking emails and everything was fine, and then around 8 AM I just... lost connection. I thought maybe my router restarted or something, but it's been hours now. I've already tried unplugging it and plugging it back in like three times.

Agent: Okay, that's a good troubleshooting step. Um, let me ask you this—do you have a modem separate from your router, or is it a combo unit?

Customer: It's... I think it's both in one? It's the box that Frontier sent me when I first got the service.

Agent: Right, so it's a combo unit. Perfect. So when you look at that device right now, what lights are you seeing? Are any of them lit up?

Customer: (pause) Um, let me go look at it. (background noise) Okay, so... I see a power light, that's green. And then there's a... I think internet light? That one's not on. It's dark.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is green but the internet light is off. That's what we want to troubleshoot. Um, can you try something for me? I want you to unplug the modem—not the router, just the modem if you can—and wait about 30 seconds, then plug it back in.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (sound of unplugging) Yeah, I unplugged it. I'll wait a sec... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now. (sound of plugging in)

Agent: Good. Give it about a minute to boot back up. You should see the lights start cycling through different colors and then they should stabilize.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's cycling... I see some orange and blue lights now. (longer pause) Alright, it looks like it's settled back to normal. The power light is green again, but... still no internet light.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Still no internet light. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to look at your account and see if there's any service disruptions in your area or any issues on our network.

Customer: Is there an outage or something?

Agent: Let me see... (pause) No, I'm not showing any active outages in Springdale right now. The network looks pretty stable on our end. Um, let me try something else. Can you try doing a full factory reset on the modem?

Customer: A factory reset? How do I do that?

Agent: There should be a small button on the back of the modem, probably recessed. You might need a paperclip or something thin to push it. You'll hold it down for about 10 seconds while the device is powered on.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's a little hole back here. Let me find a paperclip. (background noise) Okay, I'm going to push it...

Agent: Go ahead.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I pressed it and I'm holding it... ten seconds... and I'm letting go. (pause) Now what?

Agent: Now the device should go through a full reboot cycle. This might take a couple of minutes. Go ahead and let me know when the lights stabilize again.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... so the lights are doing their thing again. We're waiting... (pause) Alright, everything's settled back down. But Marcus, I'm still not seeing that internet light come on.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, that's... that's frustrating. Um, let me ask you a few more questions. How long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: About nine months. The service has been pretty good up until now.

Agent: Okay, good to know. And have there been any recent storms, construction, or anything unusual happening in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Pretty quiet neighborhood, actually.

Agent: Alright. You know, um, it's starting to sound like this might be an issue on our end. The fact that you're not getting any internet light and the reset didn't help... I'm wondering if there might be an issue with the line coming into your house or possibly with your modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long is this going to take to fix?

Agent: Good question. So what I'd recommend is getting a technician out to your location. They can run some line tests and check the signal strength coming to your house. They might need to replace the modem if that's where the problem is.

Customer: A technician? When can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. We're actually pretty booked today, but I might be able to get someone out tomorrow morning. Would that work for you?

Customer: [inaudible] work from home, so... yeah, I guess tomorrow works, but this is really inconvenient.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you're experiencing this. Um, let me get you scheduled. Are you available anytime between 8 AM and 5 PM tomorrow?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. Any time in the morning would be better actually.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm scheduling you for a morning window tomorrow, between 8 and noon. The technician will text you about an hour before they're on their way. Their name will be on the work order. And David, since you've done all this troubleshooting and you're without service, I'm going to make sure we credit your account for the day of service.

Customer: Oh, okay. Yeah, I appreciate that.

Agent: Absolutely. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's... I mean, I guess I'll just wait for the technician tomorrow. Hopefully they can figure out what's going on.

Agent: Yeah, hopefully we'll have you back up and running quickly. I apologize again for the inconvenience. Um, just to recap—you have a technician visit scheduled for tomorrow morning. If you don't hear from them by 11 AM, you can give us a call back. Our number's on your bill.

Customer: Alright, got it. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, David. We appreciate your patience, and we'll get this resolved for you.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Take care.
