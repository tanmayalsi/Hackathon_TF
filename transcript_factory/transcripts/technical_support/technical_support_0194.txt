# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work stuff I need to do and my kids need it for school.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. And can I also get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got your account pulled up here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Uh, I'd say around 8 or 8:30. I tried to log in for a work call and just... nothing. The modem's still lit up though. Like, it's got power, but I'm not getting any connection.

Agent: Okay, that's good information. Which modem do you have? Is it the Frontier-branded one, or do you have your own?

Customer: No, it's the one you guys gave me. It's, um... (pause) ...it's a white box. That's all I know.

Agent: (chuckles lightly) That's alright. Let's do some basic troubleshooting. Can you look at the front of the modem right now and tell me which lights are on?

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (pause) Okay, so I've got... there's a power light that's solid green. And then there's like a... I think it says internet? And that one's just... it's not on. It's dark.

Agent: The internet light is dark. Got it. And what about the WiFi light? Can you see that?

Customer: Um, yeah, I can see it. That one's amber or yellow, I think. Like a golden color.

Agent: Okay, so the internet light being off is definitely our culprit here. That usually means there's no signal coming into your modem. Let me just ask you a couple quick questions. Have there been any recent storms in your area?

Customer: No, actually it's been pretty nice out. Clear skies all morning.

Agent: Alright. And you haven't made any changes to your setup recently, right? Moved anything, unplugged any cables?

Customer: No, nothing. Everything's exactly where it was.

Agent: Good. Let's try a quick reset. I want you to locate the power cable on your modem—

Customer: Okay, yeah, I see it.

Agent: Can you go ahead and unplug that for me? Hold it for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) Thirty seconds... alright, it's been thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now plug it back in and just watch the lights. Tell me what you see as they come back up.

Customer: Okay, so power light comes on green, like before. Now there's some flickering happening on the other lights... okay, now I'm seeing like a white light blinking on and off next to the internet light. Is that normal?

Agent: Yeah, that's normal. That's the modem trying to sync with the network. Give it about a minute or two to fully boot up. Just watch and see if that internet light comes on solid.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... I'm watching... still blinking on the one light... (pause) ...still nothing on the internet light. It's been like a minute and a half now.

Agent: Hmm. Can you give it another thirty seconds or so?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, sure. (pause) ...still the same. Just the white one blinking, and the internet light's still off.

Agent: Alright, let's try something else. Can you check the cable connection where it goes into the back of the modem? Sometimes those can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the back now. There's a few cables here. Which one am I looking for?

Agent: There should be one that says either "coax" or "line in"—it's usually the thicker cable with a threaded connector.

Customer: Oh yeah, I see it. It looks pretty tight to me, but let me try... (pause) ...I'm giving it a gentle tug to make sure. Yeah, that seems solid.

Agent: Okay, good. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, Michael, I'm looking at your account and I'm actually seeing a service interruption notification for your area. It appears there may be some infrastructure issues affecting multiple customers in your neighborhood.

Customer: Oh, so it's not on my end? It's on your end?

Agent: It does look that way, yes. However... (pause) (typing sounds) ...let me see when that was last updated. (pause) The notation here is from about two hours ago, so it should be resolved by now. But let me do a network diagnostic on your line to make absolutely sure everything's connected properly.

Customer: Okay, whatever helps.

Agent: (typing sounds) Give me just one moment... (pause) Alright, so the diagnostic is showing that your modem is unable to establish a connection to our network backbone. Now, this could be a few things. It could be related to that service interruption I mentioned, or it could be an issue with the line itself.

Customer: So what do we do? Can you fix it?

Agent: Let me have you try one more thing. I want you to do a factory reset on the modem. I'm going to warn you, this will erase any custom settings you might have, but it usually clears out any connection conflicts.

Customer: Will I lose anything important?

Agent: Anything that was specifically configured, yes, but the important stuff is stored on our end. You'll need to reconnect to WiFi after, but that's about it.

Customer: Alright, let's try it.

Agent: Okay, on the back of the modem there should be a small recessed button labeled "reset." You might need a paperclip or a pen to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. It's really small. I'm gonna use a pen. (pause) I'm pressing it... (pause) All the lights just went off. Is that right?

Agent: Yes, that's expected. The modem is rebooting. Let's give it about three to five minutes to fully come back up. This is the hard part—just waiting.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'll wait. (pause) (background noise of tapping) Still waiting... (pause) Okay, the power light's back on. (pause) I'm seeing some lights blinking again. The white one, like before.

Agent: Right, same behavior as last time?

Customer: Yeah, looks like it. I'm gonna let it go for a couple minutes again.

Agent: (pause) Sounds good. While we wait, let me just ask—have you had any issues with your service in the past? Any intermittent outages or slowness?

Customer: No, not really. It's been pretty solid. This is the first time in... I don't know, six months? Maybe longer.

Agent: Okay. (pause) So where are we looking now?

Customer: Um, still the same. Internet light's still off. The white one's still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Alright, Michael, I'm going to be honest with you. We've gone through the standard troubleshooting steps and the modem isn't establishing a connection. At this point, it's either a hardware failure with the modem itself, or there's a line issue that I can't diagnose from here.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It means we'd need to send a technician out to your location to do an in-person inspection. They can test the line outside and potentially replace the modem if needed.

Customer: Okay... when could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) The earliest I'm showing is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? Yeah, I mean, I can make that work. I'll have to shuffle some things around, but okay.

Agent: Great. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Just to confirm—that's 555-0147, Michael Chen, and you're good for tomorrow morning, 8 to noon?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. You should receive a confirmation text or email shortly with the technician's information. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I mean, I just really hope this gets fixed tomorrow. I need my internet.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize that we couldn't resolve this today. Our technician will get you back up and running. Is there anything I should note in your account to help them when they arrive?

Customer: Just that it went out this morning and none of the troubleshooting worked. Oh, and I need to make sure someone's home, right?

Agent: Yes, someone needs to be there to let the technician in. They'll have a time window of 8 AM to noon. Thank you for choosing Frontier, Michael, and again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thanks, I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
