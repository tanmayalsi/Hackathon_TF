# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I've got work stuff I need to do and it's just... it's not working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... hold on. (pause) It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm looking at your account now for... is this Thomas Wheeler?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Thomas. I can see you're in the Millbrook area. So your service went down this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around eight or nine. I came home from taking my daughter to school and just... nothing. No lights on the modem, nothing.

Agent: Okay, let's start with the basics here. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the modem powered on?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's got power. The power light is on, but... like, nothing else is lighting up. Usually there's a bunch of lights, you know? All blinking and stuff.

Agent: Right, so just the power light. That's helpful. And you've got the modem plugged directly into the wall outlet?

Customer: Yeah, it's in the outlet next to my... yeah, it's plugged in.

Agent: Got it. So here's what I'd like you to do. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just count to ten, and then plug it back in. Sometimes that resets things.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) One... two... three... (longer pause) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about thirty seconds to boot back up. Sometimes it takes a minute to fully initialize.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I'm watching it. Um... the power light's on still, but I'm not seeing anything else happening. There's no... I don't see the internet light or whatever.

Agent: How long has it been now?

Customer: Maybe... twenty seconds?

Agent: Alright, give it another thirty or so. These can be a little slow sometimes.

Customer: (longer pause) No, it's still just the power light. That's it. Nothing else is turning on. This is weird.

Agent: Hmm, okay. So we're not seeing any of the status lights come up. That does suggest something might be wrong with the modem itself. But before we go down that road, let me ask you a couple more questions. Have there been any storms in your area recently? Any power outages?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The power's been fine all day. The lights, everything else is working.

Agent: Good, good. And you haven't made any changes to your setup? No new equipment, nothing unplugged?

Customer: No, man, nothing. It's been the same setup for like... two years? I barely touch it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright. Well, what I'm gonna do is check your line from this end. Let me see if we're getting a signal to your location. (pause) One moment... (longer pause) Okay, so I'm actually showing that we have a good signal reaching your address. So the line itself looks fine from our end.

Customer: So like... it's my modem then?

Agent: That's looking like the most likely culprit, yeah. Usually when we can see a good signal on the line but the modem isn't responding at all, it points to an issue with the equipment itself. But let's try one more thing before we go down the modem replacement route. Can you check the cable going from the wall into the modem? Is it tight?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it now. Seems pretty snug to me.

Agent: And the other end? At the wall?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that looks good too.

Agent: Okay. Um, I'm also gonna ask if you have a coaxial cable spare, or...?

Customer: I don't think so, no. I mean, I have the one that's in there.

Agent: Right, okay. (pause) Thomas, can you tell me if there's any damage to the cable itself? Like, any visible cuts or anything?

Customer: No, looks fine to me. It's just... a cable.

Agent: Sure, yeah. And the modem itself, any signs of physical damage? Water damage, anything like that?

Customer: No, no. It's sitting on a shelf, it's dry, it's... it's fine. It's just not turning on the lights it should.

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, so here's what I'm thinking. We could try a factory reset on the modem, but given that we're not even seeing the diagnostic lights come up, I'm fairly confident the modem itself has failed. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check what we have available for replacements. Should only be a minute or two.

Customer: Okay, but like... what if it's not the modem? What if it's something else?

Agent: That's fair. If we do the replacement and that doesn't fix it, we can escalate to a technician to come out and check the line itself. But statistically, when we have a strong signal on our end and the modem's not responding at all, it's almost always the equipment. Let me check on those replacement options for you real quick.

Customer: Alright, I guess.

Agent: (hold music, then return) Okay, Thomas, I'm back. So I've got some options for you, but I'm actually seeing something on your account that I want to mention first. It looks like we had a service call out in your neighborhood about four days ago, and there were some reported issues with a few modems in your area. I'm wondering if this could be related.

Customer: Wait, really? Like, I should've been notified about that?

Agent: I understand the frustration. Unfortunately, it was an isolated issue with a small number of units in your area. But what this tells me is that your modem might be one of the affected units. I'm actually gonna escalate this to have a technician come out to your place tomorrow. We can get them there between eight and noon. Does that work?

Customer: Um, yeah, I guess. I mean, I'd rather have it fixed today, but...

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what I can do. (pause, typing sounds) Actually, looking at our schedule, we might be able to get someone out this afternoon around three o'clock. Would that work for you?

Customer: Really? Yeah, that would be... that would be great actually.

Agent: Perfect. So we'll have a technician come by at three PM. They'll be able to diagnose the issue on-site and either repair or replace the modem. Before they come out though, can I ask—do you have the setup instructions or any paperwork from when you got the modem?

Customer: Uh, I don't know. Maybe? I don't really know where that stuff is.

Agent: No worries, that's not critical. The tech will have everything they need. Oh, one more thing—just to cover our bases, can you verify that this is an address where someone will be home around three?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Excellent. So I have you down for a technician visit today at three PM. Your confirmation number is going to be... (typing sounds) ...FR-847-5529. I'll also be sending you a text and an email with those details and the technician's information.

Customer: Okay, so they're just gonna show up at three?

Agent: They should arrive around that time, give or take a few minutes. And if there are any delays, you'll get a notification. In the meantime, just leave the modem powered but don't keep trying to restart it, alright?

Customer: Got it. And if this doesn't work? If they show up and it's something else?

Agent: Then they'll be able to run diagnostics and figure out what's actually going on. It could be the line, could be something in your setup—they'll get to the bottom of it. But I'm pretty confident this is a modem issue given what we're seeing.

Customer: Alright, I guess we'll find out. Thanks, I mean... I appreciate your help, even though we didn't get it working right now.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize that we couldn't resolve this on the call. But I'm hopeful the technician will get you back up and running this afternoon. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... that's it.

Agent: Great. Thank you for calling Frontier, Thomas, and sorry again for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye now.
