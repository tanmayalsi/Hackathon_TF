Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I'm working from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me get some information from you so I can pull up your account. Can I get the phone number associated with your Frontier account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, what's your last name?

Customer: Patterson. P-A-T-T-E-R-S-O-N.

Agent: Perfect. I've got you here, Mr. Patterson. I see you're on our fiber service in the Denver area. So your internet is completely down, is that right? No connection at all?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. I tried turning the modem off and back on, which I know is like the standard thing, but that didn't help. The lights on the front aren't even coming on.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting on your part. When you say the lights aren't coming on, the modem is completely dark?

Customer: Completely dark. It's like it has no power or something.

Agent: Let me ask you this—is there a power cable plugged into the back of the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's plugged into the wall outlet.

Agent: And the outlet itself—is it working? Do you have anything else plugged into that same outlet that you know is working?

Customer: Hmm, let me see. I've got a lamp right next to it. Let me turn that on and—yeah, the lamp works fine. So the outlet is good.

Agent: Great, that's helpful. Okay, and the power cable going to the modem, can you make sure it's firmly connected on both ends? Sometimes it can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) I'm pushing it in... okay, it feels pretty solid. Wait, let me try a different outlet just to be sure.

Agent: That's actually a really good idea. Go ahead and do that.

Customer: (background noise, shuffling sounds) Okay, I'm moving it over to the outlet on the other side of the desk... plugging it in... (pause) ...and... nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, that tells me it's probably not an outlet issue. Mr. Patterson, I'm going to need you to check something on the modem itself. Can you look at where the fiber optic cable comes in? It's usually a small, thin cable, kind of orange or white typically?

Customer: Oh yeah, I see it. It's right here on the back. It's like, kind of white?

Agent: Perfect. Can you unplug that fiber cable and then plug it back in firmly? Make sure you hear a little click when it goes in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, disconnecting it... and... plugging it back in... I felt a click. Did that. But still... the modem is still dark.

Agent: Hmm, okay. And you haven't had any storms or anything like that? No recent outages in your area that you're aware of?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was fine last night. I was working until like 10 PM and everything was good. I woke up this morning and it was just... gone.

Agent: Understood. Let me check our system here to see if there's any maintenance or outages on our end. (typing sounds) One moment please.

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any widespread outages in your neighborhood, but let me... let me just put you on a brief hold while I pull up our technical notes on your line. This should just be about 30 seconds.

Customer: Okay.

(hold music playing)

Agent: Alright, I'm back, Mr. Patterson. So here's what I think might be happening. The modem could have a failed power supply, or there could be an issue on our end where the ONT—that's the box that converts the fiber signal—might have lost connection. Since you're not seeing any lights at all, I think the best course of action is to get a technician out there to investigate.

Customer: Wait, so you can't fix it remotely or anything?

Agent: Unfortunately, in this case, the modem won't power on, so we can't get any diagnostics through it. A technician will need to come out and check both the modem and the fiber line. Do you have the equipment? Is it a Frontier-provided modem?

Customer: Yeah, it's the one you guys provided when I signed up last year.

Agent: Good, so we can replace it if needed. Let me get you scheduled. What days work best for you? We have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could also do Thursday afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be great. Earlier the better since I'm working from home.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get you on the schedule for tomorrow, 8 to 12. I'm going to confirm that appointment for you. Your confirmation number is 489521. A technician will be out between 8 AM and noon tomorrow to check everything out. You should receive a text confirmation shortly.

Customer: Thank you. Just to confirm, this is going to get my internet working again, right?

Agent: Well, our technician will diagnose what's causing the issue and replace any equipment that's not working properly. In most cases like this, we can get you back online during that visit. However, if there's something more complex going on with the fiber line, it might take additional troubleshooting.

Customer: Okay, I guess we'll see what happens tomorrow then.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Mr. Patterson. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for choosing Frontier, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. We'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day.
