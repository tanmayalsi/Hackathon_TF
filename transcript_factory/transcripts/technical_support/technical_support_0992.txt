# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... my internet just stopped working about an hour ago. Like, completely dead. No connection at all.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And can I get a name for the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Great, David. Thanks for that. (pause) So the internet went out about an hour ago, you said? Has anything changed recently? Any storms, power outages, or new equipment?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine all day. It just... stopped. My router's lights are still on, though. All the usual lights are blinking like normal.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Let me pull up your account here... (typing sounds) Alright, I've got you. So I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. Let's start with the basics. Can you go ahead and unplug your modem for me? Just give it about thirty seconds.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. While that's sitting there, can you tell me—have you tried restarting your modem before you called us?

Customer: No, actually, I came straight to calling you guys. I figured I'd just... (trailing off) I don't know, I thought maybe there was an outage or something.

Agent: That's totally understandable. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug that back in now.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about two minutes to boot back up. While we're waiting, let me check if there are any known outages in your area. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm not showing any outages on our end. That's a good sign, actually.

Customer: So that means it's probably something on my end?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. Let's see how the modem looks now. Are the lights back on?

Customer: Yeah, they're coming back. I see... the power light, the internet light... they're both green now.

Agent: Excellent. Now can you try connecting to your Wi-Fi from your phone or computer? Just see if you're getting a signal.

Customer: (pause) Let me grab my phone. Okay, I'm looking at the networks... I see my network there, "Frontier-4782." Let me click on it.

Agent: Sure, go ahead.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, it says it's connecting... (longer pause) No, it just keeps asking for the password. Like it won't actually connect.

Agent: Okay, that's interesting. Let me ask you—does your modem have any lights that are red or amber colored?

Customer: Um... (pause) No, actually all the lights look green.

Agent: Alright. Can you try entering the password again? Sometimes it just needs a second attempt.

Customer: (frustrated) Yeah, I'm trying... still not connecting. This is weird. It was working fine this morning.

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. Let me check your account here. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm seeing your connection, David, but it looks like there might be an issue with your signal. Let me try something else. Can you check the back of your modem for me? There should be a small reset button. Don't press it yet—just let me know when you can see it.

Customer: Reset button? Um... (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's a little red button on the back.

Agent: Perfect. That's the one. What I need you to do is take a paperclip or something similar, press and hold that button for about ten seconds. This will do a factory reset of your modem.

Customer: Oh man, really? Won't that, like, mess things up?

Agent: No, it should be fine. It'll just reset it to factory settings, and we can reconfigure it after. Go ahead and hold it.

Customer: (pause, sound of button press) Okay... holding it... ten, nine, eight... (trailing off) ...three, two, one. Let go?

Agent: Let go now, yeah.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's resetting. The lights just went out and now they're all blinking.

Agent: That's normal. It should take about a minute or two to fully reboot. Let's give it a couple of minutes. (pause) So, David, how long have you been with Frontier?

Customer: Oh, about two years now. Service has been pretty solid until today.

Agent: Good to know. We appreciate your business. (pause) Alright, I'd say we're good to check again. Are those lights looking stable now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, they're... mostly stable. Internet light is green. Looks good.

Agent: Okay, try connecting again with your phone.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm going to my Wi-Fi settings... clicking on the network... entering the password... (pause, longer pause) Uh... still not connecting. It's just spinning.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me try something here. I'm going to run a diagnostic on your modem from my end. (typing sounds, pause) One moment...

Customer: (background noise of customer typing or shuffling) Take your time.

Agent: (pause) Alright, so I'm actually showing that your modem is not registering a signal from our network at all. It's connected to power, and it's trying to connect, but it's not syncing with our system.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few different things. It might be an issue with the fiber line coming into your home, or it could be the modem itself. Let me ask you—do you have any other devices that connect directly to the modem with an Ethernet cable?

Customer: A Ethernet cable? I... I don't think so. I just use Wi-Fi.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Do you have one available? If you do, we could try plugging a computer directly into the modem with an Ethernet cable. That would tell us if it's a Wi-Fi issue or a bigger connectivity issue.

Customer: (pause) I might have one around here somewhere. Hold on. (pause, sound of rummaging) Yeah, okay, I found one. I'm plugging it in now. Give me a sec.

Agent: No problem.

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I've got my laptop connected directly to the modem with the cable. Should I see something happen?

Agent: Give it a moment to recognize the connection. Once it does, go ahead and open a web browser and try to go to a website. Google.com is usually a good one.

Customer: (pause) Alright, opening Firefox... going to Google... (longer pause) Nothing. It's just loading. The page won't load.

Agent: Okay. That tells me it's not a Wi-Fi issue. It's a deeper connectivity problem with the modem and our network. Now, I've already run a diagnostic and the modem isn't registering on our system, so... let me check something. (typing sounds, pause) Can you tell me—where's your modem located in your home?

Customer: It's in my bedroom closet, actually. Mounted on the wall.

Agent: Okay. And you said you didn't experience any power outages or anything unusual today?

Customer: No, nothing. Like I said, the power's been fine.

Agent: (pause) David, I want to be transparent with you. Normally when a modem isn't registering on our network at all, it's usually one of two things—either there's an issue with the fiber line coming into your home, or the modem itself has failed. Given that we've tried restarting it and factory resetting it with no luck, I'm starting to lean toward the modem needing to be replaced.

Customer: Replaced? So what does that mean? Like, how long is that going to take?

Agent: Well, that's what I want to figure out with you. We have a couple of options. I can schedule a technician to come out and assess the situation—they might be able to come out tomorrow or the day after, depending on availability. Or, if you want, we can have a replacement modem shipped to you, but that typically takes three to five business days.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) [inaudible] ...today, though? Like, right now?

Agent: I understand this is frustrating. Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds, pause) The fastest option would be to get a technician out to your place. They can determine whether it's the modem or the line, and they can replace the modem on the spot if that's the issue. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I guess. I mean, I need this working. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check availability. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, it looks like our earliest availability is tomorrow between 12 and 3 PM. Does that work?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think so. Tomorrow afternoon should be fine.

Agent: Great. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) I've got a technician appointment set up for tomorrow, December 14th, between noon and 3 PM. A tech will come out and we'll get this sorted out.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything I need to do before they come?

Agent: Just make sure you're home during that window. Have your modem accessible so they can examine it and the connections. Other than that, just have your account information ready—though they'll have all that on their end.

Customer: Alright. Anything else I should try in the meantime? Like, is there any chance this just fixes itself?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, no. Given what we've seen in the diagnostics, this isn't something that's likely to resolve on its own. I'd recommend trying not to power cycle the modem again, as that won't help. Just leave it as is until the tech gets there.

Customer: Okay, got it. So... I'm just without internet until tomorrow?

Agent: I'm afraid so, yes. I'm really sorry about that. I know that's not ideal, especially when you work from home. But the good news is we'll have someone there tomorrow to get it resolved.

Customer: Yeah, alright. I appreciate you trying, Marcus. It's just one of those things, I guess.

Agent: I do apologize for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome, David. Just to confirm, your technician appointment is tomorrow, December 14th, between noon and 3 PM. You should receive a confirmation call as well. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we'll get this fixed for you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, David. Take care.
