Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you taken care of. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that now. And what's the best name to have on this account?

Customer: It's under David Martinez.

Agent: Perfect, David. I see your account here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? When did you first notice it wasn't working?

Customer: Uh, around 8 AM. I was trying to work from home and everything just went dark. I restarted the router and modem already, so... (sighs) I don't know what else to do.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on restarting those. Let me ask you a few questions to help narrow this down. When you look at your modem right now, can you tell me what color the lights are?

Customer: Um, let me go look at it. (pause) Yeah, so the power light is green, but the internet light... it's orange. Is that bad?

Agent: The orange light typically indicates there's a connection issue. Okay, and your router—do you see any lights on that as well?

Customer: Yeah, the router has some lights. They're doing that blinking thing, you know? Blue and white blinking.

Agent: Alright, so we're getting power to both devices, which is a good sign. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out completely.

Customer: Okay, doing it now. (pause) Yep, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Let's wait about thirty seconds while it powers down completely. I'm going to put you on a brief hold, David, just so we can give it that full time to reset. Okay?

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (brief hold music) Thanks for your patience. Go ahead and plug that modem back in for me whenever you're ready.

Customer: Okay, it's back in. So now we just... wait?

Agent: Yeah, it'll take about two to three minutes to fully boot back up. While we're waiting, can you tell me—have there been any storms in your area recently? Any weather that might have affected your lines?

Customer: No, it's been clear all week. Pretty nice weather actually. The internet was working fine last night, and then this morning it was just... gone.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Are you noticing any of the lights changing on the modem now?

Customer: Um... the power light is still green. The internet light is still orange though.

Agent: Still orange. Let me try something else here. Can you check your router's connection to the modem? Is there an ethernet cable connecting them?

Customer: Yeah, there's a cable going from the modem to the router.

Agent: Okay, can you unplug that cable for a moment and plug it back in firmly? Sometimes they come a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Let's give it another minute or so... (pause) Still seeing that orange light on the modem?

Customer: Yeah, it's not changing. Still orange.

Agent: Alright, David, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a line test to see if we're getting a signal at your address. Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Sure. (pause) How long do you think this might take?

Agent: Just a couple of minutes. (pause) Okay, so I'm running the diagnostics now. (longer pause) Hmm, that's interesting. I'm not seeing a strong signal coming to your address. There might be an issue with the line itself or possibly at our network terminal in your area.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it something I can fix?

Agent: Unfortunately, this would be something on our end. It could be a line issue or a problem with the equipment at the street cabinet that serves your neighborhood. Have you noticed any other issues with your service recently? Any outages or slow speeds?

Customer: No, actually it's been working great up until this morning. Pretty reliable, you know?

Agent: Good to know. Well, let me try one more thing. I'm going to reset your modem remotely. This might take a minute or two, and you should see the lights restart.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Oh, I see the lights going out. Is that supposed to happen?

Agent: Yes, that's normal. Just let it sit for a moment and it should boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's back on. The power light's green again... but the internet light is still orange.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm still not seeing a signal on my end either. David, I'm going to be honest with you—this is pointing to an issue with our infrastructure on our side. The good news is we can absolutely get a technician out to investigate this and get it sorted out for you.

Customer: So there's nothing else we can try?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. When the modem isn't getting a signal from our network, it's beyond what we can troubleshoot over the phone. But I can get you scheduled for a service visit. We have availability tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM, or we could potentially get someone out the day after tomorrow in the morning.

Customer: Tomorrow works better for me. I've got meetings in the morning but I should be around after noon.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I'm getting you scheduled for tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. A technician will come out and run a full diagnostic on the line and the equipment. There's no service charge for the visit since this appears to be a network-side issue.

Customer: Okay, good. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure you have access to your modem and router when the technician arrives. They'll need to check the connections and possibly the line running into your home. You should receive a confirmation call or text about twelve hours before they arrive.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. So tomorrow between 12 and 4.

Agent: That's correct. And David, I apologize that we weren't able to resolve this over the phone today. We'll get this taken care of for you.

Customer: No, I appreciate you trying. Hopefully it's a quick fix.

Agent: I hope so too. If you need anything else in the meantime, you can always reach back out to us. Your case reference number is 2847659. Do you have everything you need?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, David. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
