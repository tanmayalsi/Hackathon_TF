Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, so my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I also get your last name to verify?

Customer: It's Morrison. M-O-R-R-I-S-O-N.

Agent: Perfect. I've got you here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? And you haven't had any service since then?

Customer: Right, yeah. I woke up around 7 and everything was just... nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let me ask you a few questions first. Are you seeing any lights on your modem right now? That's the little box, usually has some blinking lights on it?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's... let me see. There's like a power light that's on, and there's one that looks red. Is that bad?

Agent: The red one could mean a few things. Do you see any other lights besides those two?

Customer: (pause) I don't think so. It's mostly just dark except for those.

Agent: Okay. And the modem is plugged in and everything? Sometimes these things get unplugged accidentally.

Customer: Yes, I checked that already. It's plugged in.

Agent: Alright, good. Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in yet? Sometimes that can reset things and get them working again.

Customer: No, I haven't. Do you want me to do that now?

Agent: Yeah, let's try that. Go ahead and unplug it from the power, and then we'll wait about 30 seconds before we plug it back in.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, unplugging it now. I'm counting... (pause) Thirty seconds should be about now.

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (plugging sound) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it a minute to boot back up. While we're waiting, have you experienced any outages in your area recently? Any storms or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing that I know of. The weather's been fine all week.

Agent: Okay. Have you checked your computer or phone to see if you're getting any wifi signal yet?

Customer: (pause) Oh wait, yeah, I'm seeing something now. The router is showing up on my phone's network list. Let me try to connect... (longer pause) ...no, it's asking for the password and I'm putting it in, but it's not connecting. It's just spinning and spinning.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, so you're getting the network to show up, which is good, but you're not able to connect to it. Let me check on our end to see if there's anything showing up there. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your modem status here... I'm seeing that there's a connectivity issue. It looks like the modem is powered on, but it's not syncing with our network properly.

Customer: What does that mean? Is that something I can fix or...?

Agent: It could be a few things. Let me walk you through a couple more steps. First, can you check the cables? Specifically, there should be a cable coming from the wall into the modem. Can you make sure that's plugged in all the way?

Customer: (rustling) Yeah, I've got one cable going into it from the wall. That one looks pretty secure to me.

Agent: Okay, good. And just to confirm, you're not seeing any internet activity when you look at the modem? Like any lights flashing that would indicate data transfer?

Customer: No, just that red light and the power light. Nothing's blinking or anything.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Let me try something else here. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem. This might take just a moment.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (typing sounds) Sending that now... (pause) Okay, it's processing. This usually takes about a minute or so. Can you keep an eye on the modem and let me know if you see any changes in the lights?

Customer: (background noise, pause) Um, I'm still just seeing the same thing. Red light, power light...

Agent: Still nothing changing?

Customer: Nope, still the same.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Let me ask you this—when you look at the cable coming from the wall, do you know if you have a separate modem and router, or do you have one unit that does both?

Customer: I'm pretty sure it's just one unit. It's a white box, kind of rectangular.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. And have you had any work done on your line recently? Any technicians out, anything like that?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of. Everything was working fine yesterday.

Agent: Right. Alright, I'm going to be honest with you, Mr. Morrison. From what I'm seeing on my end and what we've tried, it seems like there might be a signal issue coming into your equipment, or there could be a problem with the modem itself. Let me check one more time to see if there are any outages in your area that maybe I missed the first time.

Customer: Okay. (pause) How long will that take?

Agent: (typing sounds) Just a moment. No, I'm not showing any outages in your neighborhood. The network looks stable. So it's either an issue with the line coming into your home or the modem itself might need to be replaced.

Customer: So what do I do? I really need to get this working. I have work I need to do today.

Agent: I understand. I want to help you get this sorted out. What I'd recommend at this point is scheduling a technician visit. They can come out and check your line, make sure everything is connected properly on our end, and if needed, we can swap out the modem for you.

Customer: How soon can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. I'm looking at tomorrow... or we might be able to get someone out today, but it would be later this evening, probably around 6 PM or later.

Customer: Today would be better if that's possible.

Agent: Let me get that set up for you. I'm going to schedule a technician for today between 5 and 7 PM. You'll get a call about an hour before they arrive to confirm. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works. I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm the address... (typing sounds) it's 447 Maple Street, right?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. I've got you all set. Your appointment is confirmed for today. A technician will contact you around 4 PM to let you know their ETA. In the meantime, just to recap what we've done—we've restarted the modem, we've checked the connections, and we've ruled out an outage, so we're pretty confident the tech will be able to get this sorted for you today.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything else I should do while I'm waiting?

Agent: No, I think you're all set. Just keep that modem powered on so the tech can see what's happening when they arrive. And if anything changes before they get there—like if the internet suddenly starts working—just give us a call back and we can cancel the appointment.

Customer: Will do. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome. And again, sorry for the inconvenience today. We'll get you back up and running. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's everything.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you later today.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
