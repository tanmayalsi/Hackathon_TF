# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, I'm having an issue with my internet. It's completely down, and I've been without service since this morning.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get this resolved. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, is this the address on file at 2841 Maple Ridge Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router, or is everything completely dark?

Customer: Um, well, the modem has a couple lights on it. There's like a red light that's steady, and I think there's a green one too, but I'm not really sure what that means.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. A red light typically indicates an issue with your connection. Let me just pull up your account here... (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, I'm not seeing any service outages in your area at the moment. Let's try some troubleshooting. First, can you try unplugging the modem for about thirty seconds?

Customer: Sure, hold on. (background noise of unplugging) Yeah, I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. While that's unplugging, can you also unplug the router if you have a separate one?

Customer: Yeah, there's a separate router. (unplugging sounds) Got it.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about thirty seconds for everything to fully power down.

Customer: (pause) Okay...

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Done. Um, it's booting back up now. I'm seeing some lights flashing.

Agent: Good, that's normal. The lights should cycle through for a moment. Once you see them stabilize, go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, they've settled down. Plugging in the router now. (plugging sounds)

Agent: Great. Give those a minute to fully reconnect. While we wait, have you experienced any outages recently or had any weather issues out there? Like storms or anything?

Customer: Not that I know of. It was fine yesterday. I just woke up this morning and... nothing. The WiFi wasn't showing up on my phone.

Agent: Understood. (pause) Okay, so now that everything's powered back up, can you try opening a web browser and seeing if you can connect to any website?

Customer: (typing sounds) Um... no, it's still not working. It's not even letting me load the page.

Agent: Alright, no problem. Let's check a couple more things. Can you tell me what color the lights on the modem are now?

Customer: The red light is still on... steady red. And I think the green one's not on anymore actually.

Agent: Okay. That red light typically means there's an issue with the connection coming from our end. Let me check your service status here. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any issues on my end at the moment. Have you checked the cables going into the modem? Are they all secure?

Customer: (background noise) Let me look... yeah, the cables look pretty tight. They're plugged in pretty good.

Agent: Okay, good. Sometimes they can wiggle loose and cause issues. Uh, one more thing—have you tried restarting your computer or phone to see if it's just a device issue?

Customer: Well, I tried it on my phone and my laptop, so... I don't think it's just one device.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. Hmm. (pause) Let me check something here. (typing sounds) Have you noticed any unusual activity or changes to your equipment recently? Any new installations or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. Everything's been working perfectly until today.

Agent: I understand. This is... (pause) this is a bit tricky. The modem's showing a connection issue, but I'm not picking up anything on our network side. Let me escalate this to our technical team and see if there's something happening at the line level. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, then stops)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So I've checked with our tech team, and they're not detecting any line issues at your location. What I'd like to try is a factory reset on the modem. Now, this will erase all the settings, so I'll need to help you reconfigure it afterward. Are you okay with that?

Customer: Uh... yeah, I guess so. What do I do?

Agent: On the back of the modem, there should be a small reset button. It's usually recessed, so you might need a pen or paperclip to press it. Hold it down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (background noise, searching sounds) Okay, I found it. (pause) Holding it down now... ten seconds... okay, release.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait for the modem to fully restart and boot back up. This might take a few minutes.

Customer: (pause) Alright... it's starting up again. I can see the lights doing their thing.

Agent: Perfect. Let those lights cycle through completely.

Customer: (long pause) (background noise) Okay, I think they've settled down again.

Agent: Great. Now, unfortunately we're going to need to reconfigure your connection. Let me walk you through that. Can you access the modem's admin panel? You can do this by opening a browser and going to 192.168...

Customer: Wait, I still don't have internet though, right? How am I supposed to open a browser?

Agent: (pause) That's... actually a good point. You'd need internet to access that. Let me think about this for a second. (pause) Okay, uh... this is unusual. Typically a factory reset helps, but in your case, the modem isn't establishing a connection in the first place. That usually points to a line-level issue that we're just not seeing on our end.

Customer: So... what does that mean?

Agent: It means there might be a physical issue with the line coming into your house. Potentially a damaged cable or a connection problem at our junction point. At this point, I think we're going to need to dispatch a technician to your location to do a physical inspection.

Customer: How long is that going to take? I really need my internet back online. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest we have available is tomorrow between 9 AM and 12 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? That's... that's not ideal, but I guess I don't have much choice, do I?

Agent: I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, with the troubleshooting steps we've tried and no line issues showing on our end, it does seem like a physical inspection is necessary. And I wish I could get someone out there today, but our schedule is pretty full.

Customer: [inaudible] ...fine. Yeah, I'll take the tomorrow slot.

Agent: Great. Let me just confirm that appointment for you. You're all set for tomorrow, January 15th, between 9 AM and 12 PM. A technician will come out to inspect the line and the equipment. Is there a specific gate code or anything we should know about your property?

Customer: Uh, no, just... it's a single-family house. Easy to get to.

Agent: Perfect. You should receive a confirmation call about an hour before the technician arrives. Is this number the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, this is my cell phone. That's fine.

Agent: Excellent. I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today. I know how frustrating that is, especially when you work from home.

Customer: Yeah, well... I appreciate you trying anyway, Derek. Hopefully the technician can figure it out tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sure they will. They're really good at identifying these kinds of issues. In the meantime, if anything changes or you want to give us another call before the appointment, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Okay, I'll do that. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
