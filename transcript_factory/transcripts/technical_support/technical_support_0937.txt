Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out completely. It's been down for like, I don't know, maybe twenty minutes now? And I really need to get it working because I'm supposed to be on a call for work in like ten minutes.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And just to confirm, is this for the account under... Michael Patterson?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. Alright Michael, let me pull up your account here. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your account. So you mentioned your internet went down about twenty minutes ago. Just to start with the basics—are you seeing any lights on your modem right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, actually, that's a good question. Let me look. Okay, so I've got the power light on, which is green. But the internet light—the one that's usually blue—it's not lit up at all.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information, thank you. So the internet light being off usually means there's no connection coming into the modem. Have you had any storms or severe weather in your area recently?

Customer: No, not that I've noticed. It's been pretty clear today actually.

Agent: Alright. So here's what I'd like to try first. Can you unplug the power cable from your modem for about thirty seconds? Just let it completely power down, and then plug it back in.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause, rustling sounds) Okay, I'm unplugging it now. (pause) All right, it's completely off. I'll just... wait here.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and count to about thirty, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, counting... (pause) All right, thirty seconds is up. (sounds of plugging in) Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Now let's just give it about a minute to boot back up. While we wait, let me ask you—have you made any changes to your setup recently? Moved anything, unplugged anything else?

Customer: No, nothing. Everything's been the same for... I don't know, months probably. This is the first time anything like this has happened.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. And you're getting the internet light back yet?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. The power light is on and solid green, but the internet light is... it's still dark.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try one more thing. Can you check the cable that's going into the modem? It should be a coaxial cable—kind of a thick cable with a metal connector on the end?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It looks... I mean, it looks plugged in to me. Should I try unplugging it and plugging it back in?

Agent: Actually, yes. That's a good idea. Go ahead and do that—unplug it from the modem side and then plug it back in firmly. Sometimes these can get a little loose over time.

Customer: (rustling, pause) Okay... unplugging it... and replugging it. (pause) Wait, I think I might feel a little bit of... like, a tingle? Is that normal?

Agent: A tingle? No, you shouldn't be feeling anything. Are you getting shocked?

Customer: (pause) No, no, I think it's just like... the connection wasn't quite tight? I think I might have just felt it snap into place. Let me check the modem again. (pause) Okay, um... still no internet light.

Agent: [inaudible] ...still nothing. Alright, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm showing your modem as... hmm, it's not registering on the network right now. Let me see if maybe there's an outage in your area. (pause, typing) What's your street address, Michael?

Customer: It's 4287 Pinewood Lane. Zip code 94502.

Agent: (typing) Okay, I'm checking... (pause) I'm not showing any outages reported in your area. That's interesting. Let me try something else. Sometimes if the modem is having issues connecting, a factory reset can help. But I do need to warn you—that will erase any custom settings you have.

Customer: Okay, um... will I have to call you back and re-set everything up?

Agent: You might need to authenticate again, yes. But the basic functionality should come back automatically. To do a factory reset, there should be a small button on the back of the modem. You'll need something like a paperclip to press it. Do you have that?

Customer: (pause, rustling) Yeah, I've got a paperclip. Where is this button?

Agent: It should be on the back of the modem, usually near the power cable. It might be recessed so you can't accidentally press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. It's pretty tiny. Do I just hold it down?

Agent: Yeah, just hold it down for about ten seconds. You should see all the lights go off and then come back on. That means it's resetting.

Customer: Okay... (pause, rustling) Pressing it down... I'm holding it... (pause, longer pause) All right, the lights went out. (pause) And they're coming back on now. The power light is green again. (pause) But the internet light... (pause) still nothing. Still dark.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's... that's not what we want to see. Let me just double-check something. (typing) Michael, when you look at the cable that goes into the modem, does it look like it might be damaged at all? Any kinks, tears, anything like that?

Customer: (pause) I mean, I'm looking at it... it looks fine to me. But I'm not really an expert on cables, so...

Agent: Yeah, that's fair. Well, I'm not seeing anything on my end that would explain why the modem isn't connecting. At this point, I think we might be looking at either a hardware issue with your modem itself, or possibly a line issue outside your home that I can't diagnose over the phone.

Customer: Oh man. Okay. So what do we do?

Agent: (pause) Well, the best option would be to get a technician out to your location. They can check the line and potentially replace the modem if that's the issue. How soon do you need this fixed? I know you mentioned having a work call coming up.

Customer: Yeah... (pause) I mean, that's in like five minutes now. Is there any way to get someone out today? Or... I don't know, is there like a temporary fix or anything?

Agent: Let me see what we have available for today. (typing, pause) Unfortunately, I'm only seeing appointments available for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or the day after tomorrow in the afternoon. Do either of those work for you?

Customer: (frustrated) No, I really need it today. Can't someone come out today?

Agent: I understand, Michael. Let me check if we have any same-day emergency slots. (pause, typing) (pause) I'm not seeing anything available for today, unfortunately. Our next technician availability is tomorrow morning. I am very sorry about this.

Customer: (pause, sigh) Yeah, okay. I mean, I guess tomorrow morning works. That's better than nothing.

Agent: Great. I can get you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Someone will come out and assess the situation. And Michael, in the meantime, if you need internet urgently, do you have a mobile hotspot you could use? That might help you get through that work call today.

Customer: Yeah, I can probably use my phone as a hotspot. That should work for the call at least. Okay, so yeah, let's do tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing) Your appointment is confirmed for tomorrow, [inaudible], between 8 AM and noon at 4287 Pinewood Lane. A technician will come out to diagnose and repair the issue. You should receive a confirmation email shortly.

Customer: All right. Do I need to be home, or...?

Agent: Yes, someone will need to be home to let the technician in. They'll also need access to where your modem is located.

Customer: Okay, I'll be here. And if it turns out to be something I have to pay for, you'll let me know, right?

Agent: If there are any service charges, the technician will discuss that with you before proceeding. But let's hope it's something that's covered under your service agreement.

Customer: Okay, yeah. All right, well... thanks for trying, I guess. I appreciate the help.

Agent: I really am sorry we couldn't get this resolved today, Michael. I know this is frustrating. But our technician tomorrow should be able to get you back up and running. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll talk to you tomorrow, I guess, if we need to follow up.

Agent: Sounds good. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
