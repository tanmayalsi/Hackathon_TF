# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet has been down since this morning and I've got no idea what's going on. I need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Let me just pull up your account here. Can I get your phone number or account number, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got your account pulled up. I see you're in the Riverside area. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you tried restarting your modem and router yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yes, that's a good first step. Just unplug the modem—that's the larger box—and then unplug the router if you have a separate one. Wait about 30 seconds and then plug them back in.

Customer: Okay, give me one second. (background noise of unplugging) Alright, they're unplugged. I'm counting... (pause) Okay, plugging them back in now.

Agent: Perfect. These usually take a few minutes to fully boot back up. Why don't you give it about two minutes and then we'll check if you've got a connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the lights on the modem now. We've got... one green light blinking, and another one that's... I think it's red? Or orange? It's hard to tell.

Agent: Okay, so if the lights are still cycling through colors, that means they're still booting up. Let's wait just another minute or so. While we do that, can you tell me—are you seeing any blinking red light on the front of the modem specifically?

Customer: Uh, yeah, there is a red light. It's definitely red.

Agent: (pause) That's not what we want to see. That usually indicates there's either a service issue or the modem isn't connecting properly. Let me check your line here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area currently. Do you have a Frontier gateway, or do you have a separate modem and router?

Customer: I think it's... it's all in one? It's just the one box Frontier installed when I set up my service.

Agent: Got it, so that's our gateway unit. Okay, and the red light—is it steady or blinking?

Customer: It's blinking. On and off, on and off.

Agent: Right, so a blinking red light on the gateway usually means it's not able to establish a connection to our network. Let's try a couple more things. First, can you check the cable connections on the back of the unit? There should be a coaxial cable coming in from the wall. Just make sure it's nice and tight.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. It seems pretty secure, but... let me just tighten it a bit. (pause) Okay, it's snug.

Agent: Good. And did that change anything with the light?

Customer: No, still red.

Agent: Alright. Let's try a factory reset on the gateway. This will take a few minutes. Do you see a small reset button on the back of the unit?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's like... tiny.

Agent: That's the one. I'm going to need you to hold that down for about 15 seconds. You might need a pen or something thin to press it because it's recessed.

Customer: Okay, one second. (sounds of searching) Got a pen. (pause) Holding it down... (pause) Okay, it's been about 15 seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now the gateway is going to restart and go through its initialization process. This is going to take about five to seven minutes. Is that okay, or would you prefer I call you back?

Customer: No, I can wait. I'm here.

Agent: Great. So while this is happening, can I ask—did anything happen before the internet went down? Any storms, power outages, anything like that?

Customer: Not that I noticed. I just woke up this morning and tried to check my email and nothing was working.

Agent: Okay. And this is your first time contacting us about connectivity issues?

Customer: Yeah, first time. I've had Frontier for about a year and a half and this is the first real problem.

Agent: Alright, well that's good to know. (pause) So while we're waiting, do you see all the lights cycling through different colors yet?

Customer: Yeah, actually, I'm seeing... it's going through like white, then blue, then... I don't know, it's doing a bunch of colors.

Agent: That's the normal boot sequence. We're on the right track. Give it just another couple of minutes.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) Alright, so... it looks like it's settled now. I'm seeing a green light solid, and another one... it looks green too.

Agent: Excellent. So you should have connectivity now. Can you try opening a browser or checking your email to see if you're back online?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me... (pause) Okay, I'm opening Chrome... (pause) [inaudible] No, nothing. It's just loading. Like, the page won't load.

Agent: It's still loading?

Customer: Yeah, it's just spinning. Nothing's happening.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Even though the lights look good, it seems like there might be an issue with the actual connection to our network. Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) Can you tell me what your gateway model is? It should be on the sticker on the back or bottom of the unit.

Customer: Uh... (pause) I see... it says "Arris" and then... looks like a model number. G36-something? G36-4?

Agent: G3604, okay. And do you see a status code anywhere? Usually there's a number that will help me identify what's happening.

Customer: I don't see anything like that. Just the lights and the ports and stuff.

Agent: (pause) Let me try something else. I'm going to do a network refresh on my end. This might cause your lights to flicker. Are you still with me?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, give it about 30 seconds and see if anything changes.

Customer: (pause) (pause) The lights are... one of them went red again for a second, but now it's back to green.

Agent: Okay. Try the browser again.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. Still loading.

Agent: Still not connecting. Unfortunately, I'm not seeing any signal coming through to our network on this end, which is strange because I see your account is active and everything should be provisioned correctly. At this point, I think what we might be looking at is either an issue with the modem itself or there could be something with the line coming into your house.

Customer: So... what does that mean? How do I fix it?

Agent: Well, it's likely going to require a technician to come out and check the line and possibly replace the gateway unit. I can definitely schedule that for you. How soon would you need someone to come out?

Customer: Can you do like... tomorrow? Or even today if possible?

Agent: Let me check the availability. (pause, typing sounds) We have a technician that can come out tomorrow between 1 and 3 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that works. Will there be a charge for this?

Agent: Since you're not a new customer and this is the first issue you've reported, if it turns out to be a line issue or a gateway defect, there shouldn't be a charge for the visit. If it ends up being something else, we'll let you know before proceeding. Does that work?

Customer: Okay, yeah. I appreciate that.

Agent: Alright, so I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, 1 to 3 PM, at your address on file. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. You should receive a confirmation email and a text message with more details. Do you have any other questions for me?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for trying to help troubleshoot, I guess it's just something that needs to be looked at in person.

Agent: I understand. I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved over the phone, but our technician will definitely get you sorted out tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Your confirmation should be in your inbox momentarily. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
