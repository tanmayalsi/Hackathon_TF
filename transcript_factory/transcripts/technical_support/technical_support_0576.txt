# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything but nothing's working.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I see the account for David Martinez at 412 Oakwood Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. So your internet went down this morning? Do you remember approximately what time that was?

Customer: Uh, around 8 or 8:30 AM. I was trying to work from home and everything just... stopped. And my wife tried checking it around noon and it was still out.

Agent: Okay, I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your modem and router right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) okay, so on the modem I'm seeing... it looks like the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light is... it's red. Is that bad?

Agent: Yeah, that red light indicates the modem isn't connecting to our network. That's what we're going to try to fix. On your router, what are you seeing?

Customer: The router also has the power light on but... yeah, nothing else is really lit up, I don't think.

Agent: Alright, that makes sense if the modem isn't getting a signal. Here's what I'd like you to do—can you go ahead and unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugged.

Agent: Good. And while that's unplugging, I'm going to check on our end if there are any outages in your area or any issues with your line. (typing sounds) Let me just... okay, I'm not showing any major outages reported in your zip code. But let me check your specific line. (pause) Hmm, I'm seeing some activity on your line this morning around 8:15. There might have been a service interruption.

Customer: So is there an outage or not?

Agent: It doesn't look like a widespread outage, but it's possible there was a temporary issue with your specific line. Let's go ahead and power the modem back on now. Can you plug it back in?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm plugging it in now.

Agent: Okay, give it about 30 seconds to fully boot up. While we're waiting, let me ask—have you noticed any storm activity or anything unusual around your house this morning?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been pretty clear out. No storms.

Agent: Okay, good. Alright, what are you seeing now? Any changes on those lights?

Customer: (pause) The power light is still green, but the internet light is still red. It's not changing.

Agent: Hmm, still red. Let me try a different approach. Can you also unplug your router for me?

Customer: The router too?

Agent: Yeah, the router as well. And then we'll power them both back on in sequence. Go ahead and unplug the router.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about 60 seconds and then I want you to plug the modem back in first—not the router yet, just the modem. Let me know once the modem is fully booted up.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm plugging the modem in... okay, power light is green again...

Agent: And the internet light?

Customer: (longer pause) Still red. It's... it's not doing anything. It's just red.

Agent: I see. Okay, and just to confirm—your modem is connected directly to the wall outlet with the power cable, correct? And you see the coaxial cable plugged into the back of the modem?

Customer: Yes, I... yeah, the coaxial cable is definitely plugged in. I checked that. And the power cable is plugged into the outlet.

Agent: Okay, let me check a couple things on the modem itself. Can you look at the back panel for me? Do you see any other lights or indicators back there?

Customer: (pause) Um, I see some lights but they're all... they look dim or off. I'm not really sure what they're supposed to do.

Agent: That's okay. So we're still seeing that red internet light on the front?

Customer: Yeah, it's been red the whole time.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me check something on my system here. (typing sounds) I'm going to restart the line from my end. Give me just a moment. (longer pause) Okay, I've initiated a restart of your line. This should take about two to three minutes to process. Can you just keep an eye on that modem and let me know if you see any changes?

Customer: Okay, yeah, I'll watch it. (pause) Um, how long do you think this will take?

Agent: It should just be a couple minutes. We're almost there.

Customer: (pause) Okay... still red.

Agent: Still red, okay. (pause) Alright, let me give this another 30 seconds... (typing sounds) and just checking back on your line here...

Customer: [inaudible] ...is it working now?

Agent: I'm still checking. Just one moment. (pause) Okay, so I'm showing that the restart has gone through, but I'm not seeing any connection on your line yet. Let me try something else. I'm going to have you go ahead and plug your router back in now.

Customer: You want me to plug the router back in?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and do that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's in. (pause) ...Still showing red on the modem though.

Agent: Okay, just give the router a moment to boot up as well. Sometimes it takes a minute for everything to sync back up.

Customer: (longer pause) Okay... nothing's changed. The modem is still red, and the router doesn't have any lights on except for power.

Agent: (pause) Alright, David, I've tried a few standard troubleshooting steps here, and unfortunately the modem still isn't establishing a connection to our network. At this point, I think there might be an issue with either the modem itself or potentially an issue on the line that I'm not able to resolve remotely.

Customer: So what does that mean? When am I going to have internet?

Agent: Let me get you scheduled with a technician. They can come out to your location and diagnose the issue properly. They'll be able to test the line and either repair it or replace your modem if that's the problem. How does your schedule look? I can get someone out there as early as tomorrow morning.

Customer: Tomorrow morning? I need my internet today. I'm working from home.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for this. Unfortunately, all of our same-day appointments are fully booked at the moment. But tomorrow morning I can get a technician to you between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work?

Customer: (sighs) I guess I don't have much choice, do I?

Agent: I really apologize about this, David. Let me just make sure we have the right information. The address is 412 Oakwood Drive, and your phone number is 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule a technician visit for tomorrow, May 15th, between 8 AM and noon. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes. The technician will call you 30 minutes before they arrive so you know what time to expect them.

Customer: Okay... is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: At this point, I'd recommend just leaving everything unplugged and powered down until the technician arrives. Anything else you try might make things more complicated. The technician will take it from there.

Customer: Alright. I guess I'll just... wait until tomorrow then.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't resolve this today, David. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Okay, well thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. The technician will be out tomorrow morning, and we'll get your internet back up and running as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
