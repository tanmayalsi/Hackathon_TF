Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Um, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get a name to go with that account?

Customer: It's James. James Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. It looks like you're on our Fiber 100 plan. So you've been without internet since this morning?

Customer: Yeah, since like 8 AM. I tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in, but that didn't help.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting step there. Let me start by checking a few things on our end. (pause) It looks like we're not showing any outages in your area, so this might be something with your equipment. When you powered the router back on, did you wait for all the lights to come back on before trying to connect?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I think so. The lights came back on and everything looked normal, but I still couldn't get online.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm—do you have a modem separate from your router, or is it an all-in-one unit?

Customer: I think it's just one unit. The white box kind of thing, you know?

Agent: Yeah, I know what you mean. So let's try a full reset on that. Can you unplug it for me right now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, doing that now.

Agent: Great. While that's unplugged, I want you to wait about 30 seconds. This'll give it time to fully power down.

Customer: (background noise, sounds of waiting) Okay, how long now?

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in now. This time, when you do, it's going to take a couple of minutes to fully boot up. You should see the lights start flashing and then eventually they should stay solid. Can you tell me what you see?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so it's lighting up... yeah, the lights are coming on. There's like a blue light and then a white one...

Agent: Perfect. Let those fully stabilize. That should take about two minutes. Just give me a heads up when they stop flashing and go steady.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, they're looking steady now. But... I'm still not seeing an internet connection on my phone.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check a couple things. (typing sounds) Can you try connecting to WiFi manually? Like, go into your WiFi settings and see if you can see the network name for your Frontier router?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. The network shows up, but when I try to connect... it's not working. It's like asking for the password and then saying it's incorrect.

Agent: Interesting. Okay, so the network is broadcasting but you're getting authentication errors. The password should be on the bottom of your modem. Can you take a look at that for me?

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (pause) I'm looking at the bottom... okay, I see like a long string of characters. That's the WiFi password?

Agent: That's it. Try entering that again, making sure you're getting the capitalization right. It's case-sensitive.

Customer: (pause) Okay, trying now... (pause) No, still not working. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand. Let me try something else. Can you do a full factory reset on the modem? There should be a small reset button—it's recessed, so you might need a paperclip or pen to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. How long do I hold it?

Agent: Hold it for about 10 seconds. That'll reset everything back to factory settings.

Customer: (pause) Alright, holding it... (pause) Okay, I released it. Now what?

Agent: Now let it boot back up again. This time it's going to take a bit longer—maybe three to five minutes—because it's setting everything up from scratch.

Customer: (long pause, background noise) ...Okay, it's been like five minutes now. The lights are on but I'm still getting the same issue.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me pull up some diagnostics on our end here. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm actually seeing that the modem is registering on our network, which is good, but I'm not seeing a strong signal. That could indicate a line issue or potentially a problem with the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it broken?

Agent: It could be. Or it could be something with the line coming into your house. Have you noticed anything else unusual? Like are there any unusual noises on your phone line or anything like that?

Customer: No, I don't think so. The phone's working fine actually.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. You know what, at this point I think we might need to send a technician out to your location. They can check the line and potentially swap out the modem if it's defective.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet up and running.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (pause, typing sounds) I'm showing we have availability... looks like we could get someone out there tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have a 2 to 6 PM window on Thursday.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better if possible.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to schedule that for you. That'll be tomorrow, [inaudible], between 8 and noon. Can I get a callback number to confirm the appointment?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Perfect. So to recap—we've tried resetting the modem, factory resetting it, and everything's pointing to either a line issue or a modem defect. A technician will be out there tomorrow morning between 8 AM and 12 PM to investigate further and get you back online.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate you trying to troubleshoot with me, even though we couldn't get it working.

Agent: I'm sorry we weren't able to resolve it remotely today, but our technician will get to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, James. And again, sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
