Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I need to get this fixed pretty quickly if possible.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. And can I get your name?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. Thanks for that. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember roughly what time that was?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 8 or 8:30? I went to check my email and nothing was loading. I restarted my router, but that didn't help.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on restarting the router. Let me pull up your account here... (pause, typing sounds) Alright, I've got you here. I'm seeing your account is active with no service interruptions reported in your area. Let's do some troubleshooting. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the modem powered on?

Customer: Yeah, the modem's on. It's got the lights on and everything. But like, nothing's connecting. My phone can't... I can't get on WiFi or anything.

Agent: Okay, so the modem has power but you're not getting any internet connection. Do you see any red lights on the modem, or are they all green or blue?

Customer: Um... (pause) let me look at this. I see like... green and orange? There's definitely some orange lights on there.

Agent: Okay, so orange lights usually indicate that the modem is still trying to sync with the network. That can happen sometimes. Let's do a full restart. Can you unplug the modem from the power for about 30 seconds?

Customer: Sure, yeah. (pause, sound of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now just leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds. I'll wait here with you.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that should be about 30 seconds. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yep, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Alright, it's back in. The lights are starting up again.

Agent: Perfect. Give it about two to three minutes to fully boot up and establish a connection. Can you tell me what's happening now?

Customer: (pause) It's been like... two minutes now? I'm still seeing those orange lights. Actually, you know what, one of them just went green. (pause) Okay, now I've got mostly green lights, but there's still one orange one.

Agent: Good, that's progress. Give it just a little bit more time. Sometimes it takes a couple minutes to fully establish the connection. Are you able to check if your WiFi network is showing up on your phone?

Customer: (pause) Hold on, let me check... No, I'm not seeing it. The WiFi network isn't showing up.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Well, that orange light is usually related to the downstream connection. Let me ask you a few questions. Is the modem the original one we provided, or did you replace it?

Customer: No, it's... I think it's the original? I've had it for like... I don't know, maybe three years?

Agent: Okay, got it. And you said you did restart it already, but have you tried unplugging the router separately?

Customer: Oh! No, I haven't. I just restarted it, but I didn't unplug it. Let me try that.

Agent: Yeah, go ahead. Unplug the router and leave it for about 30 seconds as well.

Customer: (pause, sound of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

(pause)

Customer: Alright, 30 seconds is up. Plugging it back in now. (sound of plugging in)

Agent: Good. Let that boot back up for a minute or two.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm waiting... (pause) No, still nothing. I'm not seeing the WiFi network.

Agent: Hmm, let me check something. Are you able to look at the back of the modem? I want to see if there's a cable connection that might be loose or disconnected.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. There's like... (pause) one cable here that goes to the wall, and then I see the router connected here...

Agent: Right, so the cable that goes to the wall—that's the coaxial cable. Can you check if it's screwed in pretty tight?

Customer: (pause) It seems pretty tight to me, yeah.

Agent: Okay, but try unscrewing it just a little bit and then tightening it back up real quick. Sometimes they work themselves loose.

Customer: (pause, sound of unscrewing and screwing) Okay, I just did that. Did that help? (pause) No, I'm still... the WiFi still isn't showing up.

Agent: Alright, let me check something on your account. (typing sounds, pause) Hmm, I'm not seeing any issues on the line. But those orange lights are concerning. That usually means there's either a signal issue or a connection problem on the line itself. Let me try having you restart everything one more time, but this time restart the modem, wait for it to fully boot, and then we'll check again. Does that sound good?

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) So unplug the modem again?

Agent: Yes, unplug the modem, wait 30 seconds, plug it back in, and then let it fully boot. So you're looking for all green lights, and then check if the WiFi network appears.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now... (sound of unplugging, long pause) Alright, it's been 30 seconds. Plugging back in. (sound of plugging in)

(pause, sound of modem rebooting)

Customer: Okay, so the lights are... (pause) they're coming up... and I'm seeing mostly green now, but I still have that one orange light that won't go away.

Agent: And is the WiFi network showing up on your phone now?

Customer: (pause) No... still nothing.

Agent: Okay, I'm... that's frustrating. That light is still bothering me. Alright, James, so here's what I'm thinking. That orange light on the downstream connection usually means there's a signal quality issue, which could be a problem on the line outside your house or possibly an issue with the modem itself. Based on what we've tried, I think we need to get a technician out there to take a look.

Customer: Oh no, really? How long would that take? I mean, I need my internet for work...

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what appointments we have available. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so the earliest I can get someone out is tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean... that's not ideal, but I guess it's better than nothing. Can they come earlier in the day?

Agent: Let me check... (typing sounds, pause) Unfortunately, tomorrow morning is all booked up, but we do have availability in that 1 to 5 PM window. Is there a specific time within that window that works better for you?

Customer: No, I mean, 1 to 5 is fine. Can I at least try one more thing before we give up?

Agent: Of course! What did you have in mind?

Customer: Well, what if I try a different cable? Like, is there something else I can check?

Agent: That's good thinking, actually. Do you have another coaxial cable that you could try?

Customer: Hmm... I might have one in the garage. Let me go look.

Agent: Sure, go ahead.

(pause, background noise)

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found one. I'm gonna unplug this cable and try the other one. (sounds of unplugging and plugging)

Agent: Alright, and now let's power cycle the modem one more time with the new cable.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging the modem... (pause) and plugging it back in. (pause) Waiting for the lights to come up...

(pause)

Customer: No, still the same. Same orange light.

Agent: (pause) Alright, yeah, that tells me it's likely not the cable. It's probably a signal issue on the line or the modem itself. I think at this point, we really do need to get that technician out here.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. So tomorrow, 1 to 5?

Agent: Yes, tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. I've got that scheduled for you now. Is that address still 342 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, there's no charge for the tech visit at this point because we haven't identified an issue with your account or service, so this is covered under your service. But if it turns out to be equipment-related, there might be a fee, though we'll discuss that with the technician if it comes up.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that.

Agent: And James, I'm sorry we couldn't get this fixed over the phone today. I know that's frustrating.

Customer: Yeah, it is, but I understand. Do I need to do anything to prepare for the technician?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home to let them in, and have your modem and router accessible so they can check the connections. Other than that, you're all set.

Customer: Sounds good. Thanks for trying.

Agent: Of course. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll get this sorted out for you tomorrow. Have a good day, James.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
