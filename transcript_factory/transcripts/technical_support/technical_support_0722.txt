# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet has been out since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll do our best to get you back online. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I see you're on our fiber service. So the internet went down this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, around 7 AM. I was working from home and it just... stopped. The router is still on, lights are blinking and everything, but I can't connect to anything.

Agent: Alright, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your modem and router? Are they the normal colors?

Customer: Um, yeah. So the modem has like a green light on top, and then there's an orange light below it. The router has blue lights on it.

Agent: Okay, so that orange light on the modem is actually indicating an issue. The modem might not be synced with our network. Let's try a hard reset. Can you unplug the modem from the power for about 30 seconds?

Customer: Sure, give me a second. (pause) Alright, unplugging it now.

Agent: Take your time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. How long should I wait?

Agent: About 30 seconds should do it. While we wait, let me ask—have you had any recent storms in your area or any changes to your setup recently?

Customer: No storms that I know of, and... no, nothing's changed. We've had this setup for like two years now without any real problems.

Agent: That's good to know. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's powering back up.

Agent: Great. This should take about two to three minutes to fully boot up. While that's happening, can you tell me if you're seeing any error messages or anything on your devices?

Customer: No error messages, it just says no internet connection. All my devices—my laptop, my phone—nothing's connecting.

Agent: Understood. And the router—can you see if it's broadcasting a WiFi signal? Is your network name showing up when you search for available networks?

Customer: (pause) Let me check my phone... No, I don't see it. Usually it shows up as "Frontier-XXXX" or something, and I don't see that.

Agent: Okay, so the router isn't broadcasting. That's helpful information. Let me check the modem lights again. What are you seeing now?

Customer: Still that orange light on the modem. And the router... the lights are kind of dim now, they're not as bright as they were before.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's... that's actually not a great sign. The router should be fully lit up by now if everything was working. Let me try something else. Can you locate the reset button on your router? There should be a small button, might be recessed.

Customer: Hold on, let me look. (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's a tiny button on the back.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to have you hold that down for about 10 seconds. This will reset it to factory settings, so just be aware of that.

Customer: Okay... (pause) It's held down... (pause) How long now?

Agent: About 10 seconds should do it. Go ahead and release it.

Customer: (pause) Alright, released.

Agent: Now let's give that a minute to reset. While we're waiting, have you checked the cables? Can you look at the fiber cable coming into your modem and make sure it's fully inserted?

Customer: The fiber cable? Um... (pause) I think so? It looks pretty secure to me.

Agent: Can you try unplugging it and reinserting it to make sure it's got a good connection?

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Alright, it's out and back in. Did that help?

Agent: (pause) Give it a moment. Can you see if any of those lights have changed on the modem?

Customer: (pause) Nope, still the same. That orange light is still there, and now it's... actually, now it looks like the green light might be going off?

Agent: It's going off? (pause) Hmm, that's... that's concerning. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check something on the backend here.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (hold music plays) (pause) (music stops) Okay, I'm back. I'm checking the signal on our end, and I'm not seeing any connection coming from your location at all. The equipment isn't even registering to us.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: It likely means there's an issue with either the fiber connection itself or the modem has failed. Since nothing we've done has brought it back online... (pause) ...I think we might need to send a technician out to your location.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need this working today. I have meetings later this afternoon.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest I'm showing is tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Is that going to work for you?

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Tomorrow? There's nothing today?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. Our next available slot is tomorrow. I wish I had something sooner.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I guess that's... that's fine. Can I try anything else in the meantime?

Agent: Well, we could try one more thing. Make sure both the modem and router are completely unplugged—both of them. Leave them unplugged for a full minute, then plug the modem in first, wait for it to fully boot, and then plug in the router. But honestly, given what I'm seeing on my end, I suspect this is going to require a technician visit.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I'll try that, but... I'm not too hopeful at this point.

Agent: I don't blame you. (pause) All right, so I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM. A technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive to confirm. Your confirmation number is 8847-FCI. Do you have a pen?

Customer: Yeah, hold on... (pause) Okay, go ahead.

Agent: It's 8847, that's F as in Frank, C as in Charlie, I as in India.

Customer: Got it. 8847-FCI.

Agent: That's correct. You should receive a text message confirmation shortly as well. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (pause) No, I guess that's it. I'll just... try that unplugging thing and hope the technician can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. We really appreciate your patience, and the technician will have you back up and running as soon as possible.

Customer: Alright, thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
