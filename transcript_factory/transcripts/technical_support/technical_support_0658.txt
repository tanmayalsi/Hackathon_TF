Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and everything, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me get some information from you real quick so I can pull up your account. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this the service address in Tucson, Arizona on Mesquite Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, so you mentioned your internet went down about an hour ago. Have you had any recent storms in your area, or any power outages?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The power's been fine. It's just... it's really strange because I was just using it this morning and everything was normal.

Agent: Okay, got it. So the modem's been unplugged already. Is it powered back on right now? Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on the modem?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's back on. I see the power light is green, that's solid. But the internet light, the one that's usually blue, it's... it's not lit up at all. It's just off.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful information. The internet light being out typically means there's no connection coming into the modem. Let me walk you through a couple of things. First, can you check the cable connection? That's the coaxial cable coming from the wall into your modem. Just make sure it's screwed on nice and tight.

Customer: (pause) Okay, give me a second... (sounds of movement) Yeah, I'm checking it now and... it looks pretty tight to me. But I'll, uh... (grunting) I'll try tightening it a bit more.

Agent: Good, good. Let me know if you see any changes.

Customer: Okay, I'm twisting it... still nothing. The light's still off.

Agent: Alright, so that didn't help. Let me try something else. Can you tell me what model modem you have? There should be a model number on the front or back of the device.

Customer: Um... (pause) it says... "Frontier FiberGateway 5000."

Agent: Perfect, thank you. Okay, so with that model, we're going to try a different approach. I want you to hold down the reset button on the back of the modem for about 10 seconds. That's going to restart the whole system. Now, this is gonna take about five minutes to fully boot back up, so just bear with me.

Customer: Okay, I'm doing that now. (pause) The button's being held down. Should I count to ten?

Agent: Yeah, ten seconds is perfect. Go ahead and count it out.

Customer: One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten. Okay, released.

Agent: Great. Now we're just gonna give it a few minutes to boot up. While we wait, let me ask you a couple more questions. Have you called in about this address before, or is this your first time experiencing an outage?

Customer: No, this is the first time. I've had Frontier for about three years now and never had a problem until today.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. And you're using the modem we provided to you, correct? Not a third-party modem?

Customer: Yeah, no, it's definitely the one you guys gave me.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Alright, so give it another minute or so. While we're waiting, let me just check on our end if there are any service issues in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any outages reported in your neighborhood at the moment, so that's a good sign.

Customer: So that means it's just my modem then?

Agent: Well, it could be the modem, or it could be something on the line between here and your house. That's what we're trying to figure out. Okay, let's check on those lights again. What are you seeing now?

Customer: Um... (pause) still the same. The power light is green, but that internet light is still off.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's... that's not what we want to see. Let me try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem again for me?

Customer: Sure, yeah.

Agent: Unplug it, and then let's try plugging it into a different outlet. Sometimes there can be an issue with the specific outlet. Go ahead and do that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now... (sounds of movement) ...and I'm moving it over here to another outlet in the room. (pause) Plugging it back in...

Agent: Alright, and now we'll give it another minute or two to start back up.

Customer: How long is this supposed to take? I mean, I'm already an hour without internet and I have some work I need to do.

Agent: I completely understand, and I appreciate your patience. These boot-up cycles typically take two to three minutes once you've plugged it in. Should be coming up here pretty soon.

Customer: (pause) Okay... okay, I'm looking at it now and... no, still nothing. Same thing. Just the power light.

Agent: Alright, let me... (pause, typing sounds) let me check something on our backend here. Sometimes the modem needs to register back with our network after a reset. I'm gonna send a refresh signal to your equipment right now.

Customer: Okay. What does that do?

Agent: It should tell the modem to reconnect to our network infrastructure. Give it about thirty seconds after I send this through.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm waiting... (pause) ...still nothing happening.

Agent: (sigh) Yeah, I'm... I'm not seeing the modem register back on our system even after the refresh. That's unusual. I think at this point, we might be looking at a hardware issue with the modem itself, or possibly a line issue. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, what do we do?

Agent: Well, the best next step would be to get a technician out to your location. They can test the line coming from the street, check the external equipment, and also bring a replacement modem if needed. Unfortunately, I'm not able to diagnose that level of issue just over the phone.

Customer: How long would that take? Can someone come out today?

Agent: Let me check our scheduling system. (typing sounds, pause) Unfortunately, our next available appointment in your area is... three days from now, on Thursday morning between 8 AM and 12 PM. I know that's not ideal.

Customer: Three days? That's... wow, okay. (pause) Is there anything else we can try right now?

Agent: At this point, I've walked through the standard troubleshooting steps and, unfortunately, the modem isn't responding as it should. I really do think it's a hardware issue. I can definitely get you scheduled for that Thursday appointment, and I'll make a note that this is a potential modem replacement situation so the tech knows to prioritize that.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I guess that's... that's what we'll have to do.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved remotely today. I know it's frustrating. Let me get that appointment scheduled for you.

Customer: Alright. Thank you, I guess.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you down for Thursday, March 14th, between 8 AM and noon. You'll get a confirmation call the day before, and there's no charge for the service call. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it.

Agent: I'm confident they will. Our technicians are really good at what they do. I'm gonna email a summary of this call to your account so they'll know exactly what we've tried. Thank you for being so patient with me today, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone.

Customer: Yeah, no problem. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day, and we'll see you Thursday.

Customer: Okay, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
