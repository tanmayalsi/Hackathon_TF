Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried turning things off and on again, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here so we can get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing an account here under the name... is this Michael Torres?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. And just to confirm, you're calling from the service address at 412 Maple Street?

Customer: That's correct, yeah.

Agent: Alright, so you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Just to start, can you tell me what you're seeing? Is there any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um, so the modem, it's got like the power light that's on, but the internet light, the one that's usually solid blue? It's like blinking red right now.

Agent: Okay, the blinking red light. That typically indicates that there's no signal reaching the modem. Before we dive deeper, have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, this is the first time. Internet's been pretty solid until today.

Agent: Good to know. Alright, so here's what I want to try first. Let's do a power cycle of your equipment. Can you locate the power cable on your modem?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and unplug it for me. We're going to wait about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we wait, let me just ask... have you noticed any weather recently? Any storms or anything like that?

Customer: Actually, yeah. We had pretty heavy rain last night and this morning. Could that be it?

Agent: It's definitely possible. Fiber lines can sometimes be affected by severe weather, though it's not super common. But let's see if the power cycle helps. Go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Alright, it's back on.

Agent: Good. Now let's give it about a minute to fully boot up. While that's happening, can you tell me... do you have a separate router, or is everything built into one unit?

Customer: I have a separate router. It's that Frontier one you guys provided.

Agent: Perfect. While the modem is booting, go ahead and unplug the router as well.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Done.

Agent: Alright. Now, Michael, what we're looking for on that modem is for the internet light to turn solid blue once it's fully booted up. Is that happening?

Customer: (pause) No, it's... it's still blinking red. Actually, now it's doing like a red and orange kind of... it's flickering between colors.

Agent: Hmm, that's not what we want to see. That typically indicates a connection issue on our end. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the line status for your address, and I'm not seeing any active signal coming into your location. That's unusual.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it like, an outage or something?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. There could be an issue with the connection from the street to your house, or there could be an outage affecting your area. Let me pull up our outage map real quick. (pause, typing sounds) I'm not showing any active outages reported in your area right now, but that doesn't mean there isn't something going on. When you say you had heavy rain this morning, do you know if there's an external box or any equipment outside your house that we use for fiber?

Customer: I... I'm not entirely sure. I know there's like a gray box on the side of the house, but I don't know if that's it.

Agent: That's very likely the optical network terminal, or ONT. That's the piece of equipment that receives our fiber signal. Have you noticed anything unusual about it? Any damage, or is water getting into it?

Customer: I'll, uh... I'll go look. (pause) Okay, so I'm out here now. It looks... I mean, it looks okay from what I can see. There's no water pooling or anything, but the area around it is pretty wet still.

Agent: Alright. That's good. Can you see any lights on the ONT? Usually there should be a couple of indicator lights.

Customer: Yeah, I see... I think I see them, but they're all red or off. I'm not sure.

Agent: Okay, so typically you should see at least one solid green light. The fact that they're all red or off is indicating that the ONT isn't getting a signal from our network. Now, Michael, I want to check something on my end. Are you able to see any fiber cables running to that box? Like, is there a thin cable going into it?

Customer: Um... yeah, there's like a thin... it looks like a thin tube thing going into the top of the box. Is that it?

Agent: That could be it, yes. Don't touch it—fiber optic cables are very delicate and can be damaged. I'm going to be honest with you, based on what we're seeing, there's likely an issue with the line running to your house. This could be something in the street-level infrastructure, especially with the heavy rain you mentioned. There might be a break or a blockage somewhere.

Customer: Oh, man. So what do I need to do?

Agent: Okay, so here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to escalate this to our field operations team. They'll need to send a technician out to diagnose the issue. Let me get that set up for you right now. (typing sounds) Do you have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM?

Customer: Yeah, tomorrow works. Morning would be better if possible.

Agent: Let me see what we have. (pause, typing sounds) How does 9 AM to 12 PM sound?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just confirm the information. That's 412 Maple Street, and the phone number we have on file is 555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. Michael, I've scheduled a technician visit for tomorrow between 9 AM and 12 PM. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. The tech will be able to assess the issue with the ONT and the fiber line coming to your house. In the meantime, there's unfortunately not much I can do remotely to restore your service.

Customer: Okay... so I'm just without internet until tomorrow?

Agent: I'm afraid so. I wish I could get it working today, but based on the symptoms we're seeing, it really does need a physical inspection. The good news is our techs are usually pretty quick at identifying and fixing these kinds of issues.

Customer: Alright. Well, I guess that's better than nothing. Is there anything I should do in the meantime?

Agent: Just try to keep that ONT as dry as possible if you can. If you have a cover or a tarp, something like that would be helpful. Other than that, just ensure no one touches that fiber cable. It's really important.

Customer: Will do.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Hopefully the tech can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sure they will. We really do appreciate your patience, Michael. You should be all set with that appointment for tomorrow. If you need anything else, feel free to reach out. Thank you for choosing Frontier.

Customer: Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
