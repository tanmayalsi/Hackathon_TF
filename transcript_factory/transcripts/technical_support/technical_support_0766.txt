Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it fixed because I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, thank you David. I see your account here. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have you tried restarting your modem yet?

Customer: Oh, um... no, I haven't actually. I should probably do that, right?

Agent: Yeah, that's usually a good first step. Go ahead and unplug your modem—that's the box that probably has some lights on it—and just wait about 30 seconds, then plug it back in.

Customer: (background noise of movement) Okay, yeah, I see it. It's got the Frontier logo on it. Unplugging now... (pause) ...and waiting... (pause) ...alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. While that's booting back up, can you tell me what you're seeing on the modem right now? Are there any lights on it?

Customer: Um, yeah, there's... it's got like, a red light right now. And I think there's an amber one blinking?

Agent: Okay, so that's not quite what we want to see. Ideally you should see a solid green light indicating everything's connected. (pause) The red light usually means there's no connection. Let me check your line here...

(typing sounds)

Agent: Hmm, okay. I'm looking at your account and it shows that your service is active on our end. Have you checked to see if all your cables are plugged in securely? Sometimes cables can work loose.

Customer: Oh, really? Let me... (background noise) ...yeah, I'm looking at the back of it. There's like three cables back here. They all look pretty plugged in to me, but let me... (pause) ...okay, I'm pushing on each one just to make sure they're snug.

Agent: Good idea. And just to confirm, you're not seeing internet on any of your devices right now? No WiFi signal?

Customer: Right, nothing. My phone's not picking up the WiFi, and I tried connecting my laptop directly with an ethernet cable and that didn't work either.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. (pause) Let me check our system here to see if there are any outages in your area. Can you tell me your zip code?

Customer: It's 98101.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, checking that now... No, I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area at this time. Um, let me try a couple other things. Is your modem still showing that red light?

Customer: Yeah, still red. Actually, wait—one of the other lights just turned green. There's like a solid green light now, but the red one's still there too.

Agent: Oh, okay, that's actually good progress. So we're getting partial connection. (pause) What I'd like you to do is check if you have a separate router. Sometimes people have both a modem and a router as two separate devices.

Customer: Um, I think so? There's definitely two boxes. There's the one with the Frontier logo, and then there's like, a black one?

Agent: That black one is probably your router. Is it powered on?

Customer: Yeah, it's got lights on it. It's on.

Agent: Okay. And just out of curiosity, did you recently have any storms in your area or any electrical issues?

Customer: (pause) You know, now that you mention it, we did have pretty bad lightning last night. Could that have damaged something?

Agent: It's definitely possible. Lightning can sometimes fry equipment. (pause) Alright, what I want to try next is power cycling the whole system. So unplug the modem, and then also unplug the router. Wait about a minute this time, and then plug them back in, modem first, then router.

Customer: Okay, unplugging everything now... (background noise) ...and I'm going to set a timer. (pause) Alright, a minute's up. Plugging the modem back in...

(pause)

Customer: ...and now the router.

Agent: Great. Let's give those about 60 seconds to fully boot up.

(pause - background noise of customer waiting)

Customer: Okay, so the modem's still showing that red light and a green light. And the router... I'm not seeing a WiFi signal from it.

Agent: The router's not showing a WiFi light?

Customer: No, I mean, it's not... I'm not picking up the network name on my phone. It's usually showing up even before the internet works, you know?

Agent: Yeah, I hear what you're saying. (pause) Hmm. You know what, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a line test to see if we're actually getting signal to your address...

(typing sounds - longer pause)

Agent: David, I'm seeing some signal degradation on your line. It's possible that the lightning strike last night affected your outside equipment or the line itself. Have you noticed any other issues? Like phone service or anything like that?

Customer: Actually, now that you mention it, our phone's been acting weird too. I wasn't sure if that was related.

Agent: Yeah, that suggests it might be an external issue. (pause) Alright, I think what we need to do here is send a technician out to your location to assess the situation. They can check the outside equipment and the line for any damage from the lightning strike.

Customer: How long would that take? Like, when could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability for your area... Okay, so I'm showing we can get someone out to you tomorrow between 1 and 3 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (hesitant) Tomorrow? Is that really the earliest? I really need internet today if possible.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. We do have some availability for emergency same-day service, but there would be an additional $85 fee for that. Let me see if we have any appointments... (pause, typing) Unfortunately our technician schedule for today is completely full at this moment. The earliest would be tomorrow.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, well... I guess tomorrow has to work. Can you make sure they know it might be lightning damage?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to make a note on your account right now indicating possible lightning strike damage and that you've got service degradation. (typing sounds) The technician will see that when they arrive. Is the 1 to 3 PM window tomorrow okay?

Customer: Yeah, that works. Do I need to do anything else right now?

Agent: You can go ahead and leave everything powered off, or you can leave it on—it won't really matter at this point. The technician will take it from there. Just make sure someone's home tomorrow between 1 and 3 PM.

Customer: Got it. I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to text you a confirmation with your appointment details and a link to track the technician. Is the number on file okay for that?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. And David, I really do apologize that we couldn't get this resolved today. I know this is frustrating.

Customer: Yeah, it is, but I appreciate you trying. Hopefully the technician can figure it out.

Agent: I'm sure they will. We'll get you back online as soon as possible. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, David. Have a good day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
