Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet just went down about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I'm working from home today and I really need this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So your internet is completely down right now? No connection at all?

Customer: Right, nothing. I've got my laptop right here and when I try to connect, it just says no internet connection. My phone's on cellular so I can at least call you, but yeah, the WiFi is definitely not working.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let's run through a few quick troubleshooting steps. First, can you tell me if you're seeing any lights on your modem right now? It should be the box... probably white or black, with some lights on the front?

Customer: Um, yeah, I see it. Let me look... (pause) Okay, so I've got a green light, a red light, and then one that's like... blinking? It looks orange or amber maybe?

Agent: Alright, so the blinking amber light is actually indicating that there's a connection issue. The green light is good—that means it's powered on. But that amber light... that's what we're dealing with. Have you tried unplugging the modem yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. You want me to do that now?

Agent: Yeah, let's try that. Go ahead and unplug it, and then we'll wait about thirty seconds before plugging it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) Thirty seconds... alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's back on. Let me check the lights... (pause) Still the same thing. Green, red, and that blinking orange light.

Agent: Okay, thanks for trying that. Um, let me just pull up your account here and see if there's anything on my end. (typing sounds) So I'm looking at your service and... let me check the signal strength to your modem. (pause) Hmm, the signal is actually coming through, which is interesting. That should be working.

Customer: What does that mean? Like, is it something on your side or my side?

Agent: Well, that's what we're trying to figure out. The signal is reaching your modem, but your modem isn't responding properly. Have you had any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of, no. It was working fine this morning when I started working.

Agent: Okay. And you said there's a red light on there too, right? Can you tell me... is that red light solid or is it blinking?

Customer: (pause) It's solid. Just steady red.

Agent: Alright, so solid red usually means... well, it could be a few things. Let me have you try something else. Do you see an ethernet port on the back of the modem? It's usually a small rectangular port where you'd plug in a cable?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I see it. It looks like there's a cable plugged in already.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so can you just unplug that cable, wait about five seconds, and plug it back in?

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging... (pause) Alright, waiting... (pause) Back in. (pause) Still the same lights though.

Agent: Yeah, I was... I was kind of expecting that might not resolve it. Let me try something on my system. I'm going to send a restart signal to your modem. Just give me one moment here. (typing sounds, pause) Alright, I've sent that through. Go ahead and let me know if those lights change in the next... maybe thirty to forty seconds?

Customer: (pause) Um... no, nothing's changing. Still the same deal.

Agent: Okay, I'm not seeing it respond to the restart command either. That's... (pause) that's telling me there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself. Let me just check one more thing. Is this the Frontier-provided modem, or is this something you owned before?

Customer: No, it's the one from Frontier. You guys set it up when the service was installed.

Agent: Okay, thank you. And how long have you had the service with us?

Customer: About two years, I think. Maybe a little less.

Agent: Alright. (pause) So given what I'm seeing here—the modem not responding to any of our reset commands, and that persistent red light combined with the amber light—it really does seem like a hardware failure. I think the modem itself might have gone bad.

Customer: Are you serious? Like, it just died?

Agent: I know it's not what you want to hear, but unfortunately, modems can fail, especially after a couple of years of use. The good news is, we can get you a replacement modem sent out right away, and it should arrive within... (typing sounds) probably three to five business days.

Customer: Three to five days? But I need internet now. I'm working from home. Can't you guys come out here today or something?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I wish I could get someone out there today, but unfortunately, our field technician availability... (pause) let me check what we have available. (typing sounds) The earliest we could schedule a technician visit would be tomorrow afternoon. They could bring a modem and get you set up. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon? I mean... yeah, I guess that's better than waiting five days. But like, I still have no internet the rest of today.

Agent: I know, and I'm really sorry about that. Unfortunately, without a functioning modem, there's not much we can do remotely. A replacement modem is really the only solution here. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule that technician visit for tomorrow?

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, go ahead. I'll figure something out for today. Can I use cellular data or something from work?

Agent: That would probably be your best bet for now, yeah. Okay, so tomorrow between... let me see what we have open... (typing sounds) I have a window between 1 PM and 5 PM. Is that window okay for you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, I'm going to put a priority flag on this account, and the technician will have a modem with them. You won't need to do anything except let them in. They'll install it and get you back up and running.

Customer: Okay. Alright, I appreciate that. So I'm all set for tomorrow?

Agent: You're all set. I'm emailing you a confirmation right now with all the details and a reference number. Is the email on file still... [inaudible]... at gmail?

Customer: Uh, yeah, the Gmail one, that's right.

Agent: Great, so you should receive that within a few minutes. And just as a reminder, if you need to reschedule for any reason, you can call back or click the link in that email.

Customer: Got it. Thank you for your help, even though we couldn't fix it right now.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get it working today, but we'll definitely have you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. We appreciate your business, and sorry again for the inconvenience. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
