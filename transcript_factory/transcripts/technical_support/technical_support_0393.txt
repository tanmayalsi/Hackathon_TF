Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've tried unplugging the router and everything but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. Your name is Robert Chen, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet has been down since this morning? Do you have any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, let me look. So the modem... it's got a red light on it. Is that bad?

Agent: Okay, a red light typically means there's a connection issue. Can you tell me which light is red? There should be a few of them.

Customer: It's like... the one on the left? The power one, I think?

Agent: Actually, the power light should be green. Let me have you unplug the modem for about 30 seconds, okay? Just pull the power cable out completely.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...doing that now. Should I unplug the router too?

Agent: Not yet, let's just start with the modem. Go ahead and count to 30 for me while it's unplugged.

Customer: (background noise, pause) Alright, it's been 30 seconds. Now what?

Agent: Now plug it back in and let's see what lights come up. This can take about a minute or two to fully boot up.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...so I'm watching it now and... hmm, it's still showing that red light.

Agent: Okay, that's not ideal. Can you tell me what other lights you see? Are there any green or blue lights at all?

Customer: Yeah, there's a green light further to the right. That one's solid green. And there's an orange one that's blinking.

Agent: Alright, so the orange blinking light is usually trying to establish a connection. That's actually somewhat normal. The real issue is that red light. Is it on the power light specifically or is it somewhere else?

Customer: I mean, I'm not 100% sure, to be honest. The modem's kind of in the back of my entertainment center so it's hard to see.

Agent: I understand. Can you unplug the router as well this time? Let's do a full reset of both devices. Unplug the modem and the router.

Customer: Both of them?

Agent: Yes, both of them. And this time wait for a full minute before plugging anything back in.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) (pause) Alright, it's been about a minute.

Agent: Go ahead and plug the modem back in first, and then plug in the router about 30 seconds after that.

Customer: (typing sounds, plugging sounds) Okay, modem's in... and... (pause) ...now the router.

Agent: Great. While those are booting up, can I ask... have there been any storms in your area recently? Or any changes to your setup?

Customer: No storms that I know of. Um, nothing's changed. Well, actually, my roommate did some work in the garage yesterday, but I don't think he touched anything with the internet.

Agent: Was there any construction or digging?

Customer: Maybe? I'm not really sure. He was working on some shelving.

Agent: Okay, that's probably not it then. Now, do you have internet access on your phone right now? Like cellular data?

Customer: Yeah, I'm calling you on my cell, so yeah.

Agent: Perfect. Can you try opening a website real quick on your phone just to confirm your cellular is working?

Customer: Sure, let me... (pause) ...yeah, that works fine.

Agent: Good. So we're just dealing with the home internet. Are you seeing any changes in the modem and router lights now?

Customer: (pause) Um, the orange light is still blinking on the modem. But I'm not seeing the red light anymore, actually.

Agent: Oh, that's good news! That's progress. The orange blinking light is trying to connect to our network. Give it another minute or so to establish a connection. Sometimes this can take a few minutes.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...how much longer should I wait?

Agent: Give it about two more minutes. While we're waiting, let me check if there are any service outages in your area. (typing sounds) Can you tell me your address?

Customer: It's 447 Maple Street, apartment 2B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm checking... and I'm not seeing any known outages in your area right now. That's good.

Customer: So... is something wrong with my modem?

Agent: Not necessarily. Let's see if the connection establishes. Has it been about two minutes now?

Customer: Yeah, pretty much.

Agent: Okay, can you try unplugging your computer or whatever device you use and plugging it back in? Or if you have a WiFi device, you can try disconnecting and reconnecting to the WiFi network.

Customer: Alright, I'm unplugging my laptop. (pause) Plugging it back in... and... (pause) Nope, still nothing. I'm not even seeing the WiFi network pop up as available.

Agent: Hmm, okay. And the orange light is still blinking?

Customer: Yeah, it's still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Let me try one more thing. Can you do a hard reset on the modem? There should be a reset button on the back. You'll need something small like a paperclip to hold it down for about 10 seconds.

Customer: Okay, um, let me find a paperclip... (background noise) ...alright, I found one. So I just hold down the button on the back?

Agent: Yes, for about 10 seconds. Just be aware that this will erase all your settings, but since we need to get you connected, it should be worth it.

Customer: Okay, doing that now... (pause) ...holding it... (pause) ...okay, released it.

Agent: Good. Now let's let it boot back up completely. This might take a couple of minutes.

Customer: (pause) Alright... (pause) ...still waiting. Is this normal?

Agent: Yeah, after a reset it can take a little longer. Just give it a moment. (pause) Any change in the lights?

Customer: Okay, so now the orange light... it's still blinking, but the green one is like... flickering now?

Agent: Okay, so that's actually something different. The green light flickering could mean it's trying to establish a connection. How long has it been?

Customer: I don't know, maybe two minutes?

Agent: Alright, [inaudible]... let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) Can you hold for just one second?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I've checked our line to your address and everything looks good on our infrastructure side. The signal is reaching your location.

Customer: So it's my modem?

Agent: It could be, or it could be a connection issue between the modem and our network. Let me try a few more things. Can you try disconnecting the coaxial cable from the back of the modem and reconnecting it?

Customer: The thick cable?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Unplug it and plug it back in firmly.

Customer: (pause) Okay, done. (pause) Still the same thing.

Agent: Alright. Um... (pause) ...I have to be honest with you, Robert, I think there might be a hardware issue with your modem. The fact that it's not establishing a connection even after the reset is unusual.

Customer: So I need a new modem?

Agent: That's likely the case, yeah. We can definitely get you a replacement sent out. But given how long that can take sometimes, you might want to ask if there's a local office where you can pick one up today if you need internet right away.

Customer: How long would shipping take?

Agent: Typically three to five business days, depending on your location.

Customer: Ugh, that's not great. I work from home so I really need this figured out sooner.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what options I have for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so we do have a service location downtown that you might be able to visit today if you want to swap it out in person. Would that work for you?

Customer: Maybe, but I'd have to check their hours. Can you give me the address?

Agent: Of course. Let me get that for you. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, it's at 1200 Commerce Drive, and they're open until 6 PM today.

Customer: Okay, I'll try to get over there. What do I need to bring with me?

Agent: Just bring your account number or ID, and we'll get you set up with a replacement modem right away. And we can also waive the shipping fee since you're picking it up.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. So I should just go grab a new one?

Agent: Yeah, I think that's your best bet at this point. We've tried all the standard troubleshooting and the modem just isn't connecting properly.

Customer: Okay, thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll head over to that location.

Agent: Perfect. We really appreciate your patience, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we hope to have you back online soon!

Customer: Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day!
