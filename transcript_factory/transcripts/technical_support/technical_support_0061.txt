Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back online. I've been without service for like two hours now.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here so we can get this sorted out for you. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. I'm showing a Frontier Fiber connection at your address. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, you're experiencing a complete outage? Like, you can't get any internet at all right now?

Customer: Right, nothing. My router won't even light up properly. Well, I mean, it does light up, but I'm not connecting to anything. I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, which is usually what I do, but... nothing changed.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting on your part. Let's take this step by step then. When you say the router won't light up properly, what exactly are you seeing? Can you describe which lights are on or off?

Customer: Um... (pause) okay, so the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light, the one that usually blinks, it's just... off. Not blinking, just completely dark.

Agent: That's helpful information. And you said you already did a power cycle. Did you wait the full thirty seconds before plugging it back in?

Customer: (pause) Not really, no. I think I waited like... ten seconds maybe?

Agent: Ah, let's try that again with the full thirty seconds. That'll give the modem time to fully reset. Can you unplug your router right now for me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And now I need you to wait for thirty seconds. I'll wait here with you.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) ...this is the longest thirty seconds. (pause) Alright, I think that's thirty.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it in... (pause) ...now it's starting up...

Agent: Good. While that boots up, let me ask you a few more questions. Have you noticed any weather issues today? Any storms or anything like that?

Customer: No, actually the weather's been pretty nice. Clear skies.

Agent: Okay, that's good. And are there any other outages in your area that you're aware of? Have your neighbors mentioned anything?

Customer: Not that I know of, but I haven't really talked to them about it.

Agent: (pause) Alright, so the modem should be booted up now. Are you seeing that internet light yet?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. The power light is green, but the internet light is still dark.

Agent: Okay. Let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm actually showing that your modem is... not communicating with our network. That's unusual. Can you tell me what model router you have? It should be on a label on the bottom or back.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me flip it over here... it says... Frontier Quantum Gateway G1100.

Agent: Perfect. And when did you first notice the internet went out?

Customer: Like I said, this morning. Around eight o'clock. I was trying to check my email and I noticed the WiFi wasn't showing up on my computer.

Agent: Okay. And you haven't made any changes to your setup recently? No new devices, no moving the router around or anything?

Customer: No, everything's been the same for months.

Agent: Alright. Let me have you try something else for me. Can you check the ethernet cable on the back of your modem? The cable that's connected to the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause) The cable that... okay, I see it. It's connected, looks fine to me. Seems pretty secure.

Agent: Can you try unplugging it from the wall outlet and plugging it back in? Make sure you hear a little click.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it... and... (pause) ...plugging it back in. Yeah, I heard a click.

Agent: Good. Give that about fifteen seconds and see if the internet light comes on.

Customer: (long pause) No, still nothing. This is weird.

Agent: I understand. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at the line here and... I'm not seeing a signal coming from your location at all. That typically means either the modem isn't responding, or there could be an issue outside with the line itself. Have you noticed any digging or construction in your area? Anything like that?

Customer: Hmm, not recently, no.

Agent: Alright. Let me try one more thing. Can you restart your computer and see if that helps at all?

Customer: (pause) You want me to restart my computer? But the router isn't even connecting to the internet, so how would that help?

Agent: You know what, you're right. That probably won't help in this case. I apologize. (pause) Unfortunately, based on what I'm seeing here, it looks like there might be an issue on our end with the line coming into your home, or possibly the modem itself is not functioning properly. I think we're going to need to get a technician out to your location to take a look at this.

Customer: Oh no, really? How long would that take?

Agent: Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds) (pause) I can get someone out to you tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need my internet today. I'm working from home and I've already lost two hours.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm really sorry about that. Unfortunately, tomorrow is the earliest availability I have in your area. I know it's not ideal, but that's what we have right now.

Customer: (frustrated pause) Yeah, I mean... I guess that's fine. What time exactly will they be there?

Agent: It'll be sometime between 8 AM and 12 PM. They'll give you a call about thirty minutes before they arrive so you know when to expect them. And we'll make a note on your account that this is time-sensitive, okay?

Customer: Alright, I appreciate it. So is there anything else I can try in the meantime? Like, before tomorrow?

Agent: Honestly, at this point, I think we've exhausted the basic troubleshooting. I'd recommend just leaving the modem unplugged until the technician comes, just to be safe. If you want to try that full restart one more time tonight, you're welcome to, but I wouldn't get your hopes up.

Customer: Okay, I won't. So someone will definitely be there tomorrow?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. They'll be there between 8 AM and 12 PM. Is there a phone number they should call to reach you?

Customer: It's the same number we used on the account, 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just confirm your address as well. You're at 447 Maple Street, apartment 3B, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just to recap, we've got a technician visit scheduled for tomorrow between 8 and noon to diagnose this internet outage. You should receive a call about thirty minutes before they arrive. Do you have any other questions for me?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, Derek.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. I know it's frustrating. But we'll get you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's all.

Agent: Okay. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
