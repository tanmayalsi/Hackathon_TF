# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey Derek, yeah, my internet is completely down. It's been out since this morning and I really need to get back online.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Uh, it's 555-0147. The area code is 208.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. Account for Michael Torres on Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. So your internet service is down as of this morning? Walk me through what happened. Did you notice any warning signs before it went out, or did it just stop working?

Customer: No warning signs, man. I woke up, tried to log into work—I work from home—and nothing. No internet at all. I've got the little Frontier modem you guys gave me and there's like... I don't know, some lights are on but I'm not really sure what they're supposed to look like.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Let's start with the basics. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on the modem right now? Are they green, red, amber...?

Customer: Uh, there's a green light that says "Power" and then there's like a red light on the other side. I think it says "Internet" or something?

Agent: A red light on the Internet port—that's what we need to address. Okay, so here's what I want to do. First, can you unplug the modem from the power outlet for about 30 seconds? Then plug it back in and let's see if that helps.

Customer: Yeah, sure. Give me a second. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. I'm gonna... wait, 30 seconds, right?

Agent: That's right, about 30 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Now just give it about two minutes to boot back up. While we're waiting, let me ask—have you checked if there are any cables that might have come loose? Sometimes if a cable gets bumped or...

Customer: I did look at it real quick. Everything seems pretty tight back there. I mean, I'm not exactly a tech guy, so...

Agent: That's totally fine. Do you see the modem rebooting? There should be some lights flickering.

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I see that. Lights are doing their thing now.

Agent: (pause) Okay, and do you have another device you could try connecting to? Just to confirm the internet still isn't working? Could be your phone or a laptop or anything with Wi-Fi?

Customer: I've got my phone right here. Let me... (pause) No, I'm still not seeing the Wi-Fi network at all. Like, it's not even showing up as an available network.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's a bit unusual. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your modem diagnostics from here and... let me see. When did Frontier last install or service your modem?

Customer: Oh, uh, I've had it for like... maybe three years? I'm not totally sure. It came with my service when I first signed up.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the modem's been pretty stable until now?

Customer: Yeah, honestly it's been great. This is the first real problem I've had.

Agent: That's good to hear. Alright, let me try a couple more things. Have you checked your bill lately? Sometimes if there's a payment issue or something similar, it can affect service.

Customer: No, I pay my bills on time. I've got automatic payments set up. That shouldn't be an issue.

Agent: I didn't think so, I just had to ask. Okay, so let me try resetting the modem to factory settings. Can you locate the small reset button? It's usually recessed into the back of the unit.

Customer: Uh... (pause) I see a tiny button here. There's like a little hole.

Agent: That's the one. I'm going to have you press and hold that button for about 10 seconds. Do you have something like a paperclip or a pen that could fit in there?

Customer: Yeah, I've got a paperclip. (pause) Okay, I'm holding it in... one, two, three... how many seconds did you say?

Agent: About 10 seconds. Just hold it there while it resets.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm at about 10 seconds now. Anything happening?

Agent: The lights should flash or reset. Give it another minute or so to reboot.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. The lights are blinking again. Same thing as before though—that red light on the Internet is... still red. It's not turning green or anything.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me check the line from my end. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing any connectivity on the line. Let me see if there's something on our network side that's causing an issue. Can you hold for just a moment while I pull up the diagnostics?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (on brief hold, hold music plays)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So here's what I'm seeing—and this is a little unusual—but the line itself seems to be down. Like, the signal isn't reaching your modem at all from our equipment.

Customer: What does that mean? Is it on Frontier's end then?

Agent: It could be, or it could be an issue with the line coming into your house. There might be a break or damage somewhere in the cable line that runs to your home. Sometimes it happens after a storm, or [inaudible] just wear and tear.

Customer: We didn't have a storm or anything. It's just been normal weather.

Agent: Yeah, I hear you. Sometimes it just happens for no obvious reason. Okay, so I've got a couple of options for you. The first thing would be to schedule a technician to come out and inspect the line. They can do a full diagnostic and see what's happening.

Customer: How soon can someone get out here?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. We've got... looks like we have a window either tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or the following day in the morning, between 8 AM and noon.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon works. I can be here for that.

Agent: Perfect. I'm gonna get that scheduled for you. Is 555-0147 still the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yep, that's the one.

Agent: Great. So we have you scheduled for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM. A technician will come out and check the line. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you troubleshoot? Or is there anything I should note on your account for the technician?

Customer: No, I think we've tried everything. I just... I mean, I work from home so this is kind of critical for me. Is there any way to speed this up or get someone out today?

Agent: I completely understand how important that is. Let me check one more time if we have any same-day availability. (pause, typing sounds) Unfortunately, we're booked solid today. Tomorrow morning is actually full too. The 1 to 5 window tomorrow is the earliest we've got available.

Customer: Alright, I guess tomorrow afternoon it is then. What happens if it's not the modem? Like, what if it's something else?

Agent: Well, the technician will be able to diagnose it. If it's the line, they can repair it on-site. If it turns out to be something with the modem after all, they might replace it. And of course, we'll get you back online.

Customer: Okay. Alright, I suppose I can work around it until tomorrow. Will I get any kind of confirmation about the appointment?

Agent: We'll send you an email confirmation shortly, and you'll also get an automated text reminder about two hours before the technician arrives. That'll have a callback number too if you need to reschedule.

Customer: Sounds good. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working remotely today, but I'm confident our technician will get you sorted out tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help with?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow afternoon. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
