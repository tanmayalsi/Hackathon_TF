# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out completely. Like, I have no connection at all right now, and I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. One second... Alright, I've got you here. And when you say your internet went out—did this happen suddenly, or have you been having issues leading up to this?

Customer: It was pretty sudden. I was working from home this morning, everything was fine, and then maybe like twenty minutes ago I just... nothing. The modem's still lit up, but I'm getting no signal to any of my devices.

Agent: Gotcha. So the modem has lights on it. That's a good sign. Which lights are showing up right now? Are you looking at it?

Customer: Um, yeah, let me... (pause) ...okay so I'm looking at it. The power light is green, and I think the internet light is red. Or is it orange? It's hard to tell. It's definitely not green though.

Agent: Alright, so if that light isn't green, that usually indicates there's no active connection coming from our line. Before we do anything else, let's try a quick restart. Can you unplug the modem for about thirty seconds and then plug it back in?

Customer: Sure, I can do that. (pause) Unplugging it now... (background noise) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just let it sit for a few seconds... and then go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, the lights are coming back. We're waiting for it to boot up...

Agent: Perfect. It should take about a minute or two to fully restart. While we wait, have there been any recent storms in your area? Sometimes weather can affect the lines.

Customer: Oh, um... no, actually it's been pretty clear out. No rain or anything. Should I be checking something on my end?

Agent: No, no, you're good. I was just seeing if there were any external factors. So... is the internet light green yet?

Customer: (pause) Not yet. Still looks kind of... dim? Like it's not fully on. (pause) It's been like thirty seconds, maybe less.

Agent: Yeah, that's normal. Give it another minute or so. While we're waiting, have you had any issues with the service in the past week or so? Anything unusual?

Customer: No, nothing. It's been working great actually. Like, really good speeds. So this is just... weird.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay. Let me check if there are any service alerts or outages in your area... (pause) Hmm, I'm not seeing anything on our end. Do you live in a building with other units, or is this a house?

Customer: It's a house. We're pretty far out from the city actually, so...

Agent: Alright, that helps. (pause) How's that light looking now?

Customer: (pause) It's getting brighter. Yeah, I think it's almost there. Actually, I'm going to grab my phone and see if I can connect to the WiFi... (pause) Still nothing. [inaudible] ...still loading.

Agent: Okay, still give it just another few seconds to fully come online. The internet light should be solid green.

Customer: (longer pause) Okay... yeah, the light is green now. The internet light is definitely green.

Agent: Excellent. Now try connecting to the WiFi with your phone.

Customer: (pause) I'm seeing the network now. Let me try to... (pause) ...okay, connected. (pause) But I'm not... I'm not getting data. Like, I'm connected but there's no internet.

Agent: Hm, that's odd. So you can see the network and you're able to connect, but you're not getting any internet traffic?

Customer: Right, yeah. Nothing's loading. It's like I'm connected to nothing, you know?

Agent: I understand. Let me... (typing sounds) ...let me check a few things on my end. Can you try disconnecting from that WiFi network and reconnecting?

Customer: Yeah, I'll try that. (pause) Disconnecting... reconnecting... (pause) Nope, same thing. Still no internet.

Agent: Okay. Let me ask—do you have any devices that are connected via ethernet? Like a computer or anything?

Customer: I have a laptop I could plug in. Do you want me to try that?

Agent: Yeah, that would be helpful. That'll tell us if it's a WiFi issue or something broader.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm grabbing the cable... (sounds of movement) ...plugging in now. (pause) One second for it to recognize... (pause) Okay, I've got it plugged in.

Agent: Great. Can you open a browser and try going to a website? Anything—Google, Facebook, whatever.

Customer: (pause) Typing... (pause) Nothing. The page won't load. It's like... it's just sitting there.

Agent: It's just loading indefinitely?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. Or it's not even trying to load. It's hard to tell.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Well, that tells me this isn't a WiFi issue. It's something with the connection itself. Let me check the modem again. Are there any other lights on the modem that might be blinking or red?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...there's like a... the light on the left is blinking. It's white or blue maybe? And there's one down at the bottom that's sort of... orange-ish?

Agent: The one that's blinking—do you know what that one is? Is there any label next to it?

Customer: I'm not... it's hard to see from where I'm at. (pause) Let me look closer. (pause) I think it says "Link" or something?

Agent: Okay, and the orange one?

Customer: (pause) I can't really tell. The labeling's kind of worn off on this thing.

Agent: Alright, that's okay. Let me try something else. I'm going to send a signal to your modem remotely and see if we can get a connection reestablished. Can you just... stay on the line while I do this?

Customer: Sure, yeah.

Agent: (pause) This might take a minute... (typing sounds) Okay, I'm sending the signal now... (longer pause) ...and that should be coming through any second now. Check your modem again.

Customer: (pause) Still the same. Nothing's changed.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Let me try that again. (typing sounds) Okay, sending it again... (pause) Sometimes it takes a second or two to process...

Customer: (pause) Still nothing happening. Should I see something change?

Agent: You might see the lights blink or change colors briefly, but it looks like... it looks like the modem might not be receiving the signal at all. (pause) Let me ask you—have you checked the cables connected to the modem? Like, the coaxial cable coming from the wall?

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) ...I could look at it, but I'm not really...

Agent: I know, it's not your favorite thing. But just make sure the cable going into the modem is snug. Sometimes they come loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it. (pause) Yeah, I think it's pretty tight actually. It doesn't seem loose.

Agent: Can you try unscrewing it just a little bit and then tightening it back down? Sometimes that resets the connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay... unscrewing... (pause) ...and tightening back. (pause) Now what?

Agent: Go ahead and restart the modem one more time and let's see if that helps.

Customer: (pause) Unplugging... (pause) ...plugging back in. (pause) We're waiting... (pause) Okay, the lights are coming back. (longer pause) ...and we're back to the same thing. Green internet light, blinking link light, orange light at the bottom.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Yeah, I'm... I'm not seeing any activity on our end either. This is looking like it might be an issue with the line itself or potentially the modem hardware. (pause) Unfortunately, I think what we might need to do here is get a technician out to your location to diagnose this properly.

Customer: Oh man, really? (pause) Like, how long would that take?

Agent: (typing sounds) So it looks like our earliest available appointment would be... tomorrow afternoon. Between 1 and 5 PM. Or we might have something available the day after.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon could work, I guess. I mean, I was hoping to get this fixed today but... (pause) Can you guarantee it'll work after the technician comes out?

Agent: A technician will be able to physically check everything—the line, the modem, all the connections. They'll be able to determine if it's something simple we can fix on-site or if we need to send out a replacement modem or whatever the issue is. I can't guarantee anything without them looking at it, but they're really good about getting people back online.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I guess that's what we need to do then.

Agent: Alright. Let me set that up for you. I'm going to need to confirm your address one more time...

Customer: It's 447 Maple Drive, (pause) Willowbrook.

Agent: (typing sounds) And that's W-I-L-L-O-W... B-R-O-O-K?

Customer: Yep, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And your phone number is the one on file, 555-0147?

Customer: Actually, that's my old number. Can you update it? It's 555-0289.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, updating that now... (pause) ...and I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will meet you there. You should receive a confirmation text and email at... (pause) ...what email do you have on file?

Customer: It should be [inaudible]@gmail.com. J-E-N-K-I-N-S.

Agent: Perfect. You'll get everything sent there. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's it. I guess I'll just wait for the technician tomorrow.

Agent: Sounds good. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today, but hopefully the technician will get you back up and running tomorrow. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks for trying anyway. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Take care!
