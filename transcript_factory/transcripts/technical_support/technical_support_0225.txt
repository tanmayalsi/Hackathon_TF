# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of. Nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Hutchins.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see you here. So your internet service went out about an hour ago, you said?

Customer: Yeah, yeah. One minute everything was fine, I was working from home, and then just... nothing. The lights on my router are all red now.

Agent: Okay, all red lights. That's helpful information. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me where your modem and router are located? Are they close together?

Customer: They're, uh, in my office. Yeah, they're sitting right next to each other on my desk.

Agent: Good. And they're both plugged in?

Customer: Of course they're plugged in. (slight irritation) Sorry, I just... I've already checked that a few times.

Agent: No, no, I totally understand. That's just where we have to start. Is there a power indicator light on your modem itself?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... Yeah, there's a light but it's flickering. It's not steady like it usually is.

Agent: Okay, so the modem light is flickering. That could indicate a few things. What I'd like to do is have you perform a power cycle. Can you unplug the modem for me?

Customer: (sound of something being unplugged) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Let's leave that unplugged for about 30 seconds. I know it's not long, but it helps reset the system. While we wait, have you noticed any storms or weather in your area today?

Customer: Actually, now that you mention it, there was some pretty heavy rain this morning. Could that have something to do with it?

Agent: It definitely could. Weather events can sometimes affect our lines. We're keeping track of those incidents. Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Perfect. Give it about 60 seconds to boot back up. While it's doing that, let me check on the line to your address. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area at the moment...

Customer: Really? So it's just me?

Agent: It looks that way right now, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything's wrong on your end. It could be a line issue we haven't detected yet. Give it another 10 seconds or so... Anything happening with the lights yet?

Customer: (pause) No, still red. Actually, wait—no, one of them just turned green. Okay, now two of them are green. (pause) Okay, the internet light just came on too. Does that mean—

Agent: That's excellent! Let me have you try connecting to the internet now. Can you open a browser and try to load a website?

Customer: (typing sounds, then pause) Um... it's loading. It's loading... (longer pause) No, it's still loading. This is taking forever.

Agent: Sometimes it takes a moment to fully connect. How about now?

Customer: (pause) No, it's just... it's frozen. The page won't load.

Agent: Okay, let's give it another 30 seconds. Sometimes after a reboot like that it takes a bit to fully stabilize.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. This is frustrating. I have a meeting in like an hour that I really need to be online for.

Agent: I completely understand, and we'll get this sorted out. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm showing that your modem is attempting to connect but it's dropping the connection repeatedly. That's interesting. Are you able to tell if the connection lights are still stable on the modem?

Customer: Let me see... (pause) No, actually they're flickering again. It's like it connected for a second and now it's disconnecting.

Agent: Okay, that helps me understand what's happening. I want to try one more thing before we move forward. Can you locate the reset button on your modem? It's usually a small recessed button on the back.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Yeah, I see it. What do I do?

Agent: I need to warn you—if you press and hold that button, it will completely reset the modem to factory settings, and we'll need to reconfigure everything. Before we do that, let me...let me just check something. (pause, typing sounds) 

James, I'm actually seeing something interesting here. There appears to be a potential issue with the line coming into your home. The signal strength is fluctuating significantly, which matches what we're seeing with your connection dropping.

Customer: What does that mean? Is there something wrong with the line?

Agent: It could be. It might be external damage from the weather you mentioned earlier, or it could be a connection issue at the junction point. Let me put you on a brief hold while I contact our technical team to see if they've been dispatched to your area yet. Just give me one moment.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (hold music, approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: James? I'm back.

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Okay, so I spoke with our dispatch team and they haven't received any reports of line damage in your neighborhood yet, but they're saying that with the weather this morning, they are actively checking the lines in your area. Now, since we can't seem to get a stable connection through our troubleshooting steps, I have a couple of options for you.

Customer: Okay, what are they?

Agent: The first option is I can schedule a technician to come out to your home. They can check both the external lines and your equipment. That would typically be scheduled for tomorrow or the next available day. The second option is you can try the factory reset on the modem, but honestly, based on what I'm seeing here, I don't think that's going to solve the problem.

Customer: How much is a technician visit going to cost me?

Agent: Since we haven't confirmed that this is an equipment issue on your end, and it appears to be a line issue, the technician visit should be covered under your service agreement. There shouldn't be a charge.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I guess I need to schedule one then. When's the earliest they can come out?

Agent: Let me check the schedule here. (typing sounds) It looks like we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? Yeah, I can make that work.

Agent: Great! So I'm going to schedule that for you. A technician will arrive between 8 and 12 tomorrow. You'll receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details. The technician will be able to check everything and hopefully get you back online.

Customer: Alright. And if it's a line issue, they can fix it then?

Agent: They'll be able to diagnose the exact problem and either fix it on the spot or arrange for the necessary repairs. If it takes more than what they can do in one visit, they'll make sure it gets prioritized. I really apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone for you today.

Customer: Yeah, I mean... I appreciate you trying. This is just not ideal with my work schedule.

Agent: I completely understand. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully everything works out tomorrow.

Agent: It should. Our technicians are really good at what they do. You'll get a confirmation email, and they'll call you before they arrive. Is the best number to reach you the one on file?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for choosing Frontier, James, and sorry again for the trouble. We'll get you back up and running.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
