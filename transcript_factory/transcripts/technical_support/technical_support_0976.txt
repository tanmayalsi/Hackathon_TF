Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got some work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here. And can I get a name please?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? When exactly did you first notice it wasn't working?

Customer: Um, around 8 o'clock, I think? Yeah, 8 AM. I tried restarting the modem and router, but nothing happened.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on restarting those already. Let me ask you a few questions. When you look at your modem right now, what color are the lights on it?

Customer: Uh... (pause) they're mostly red and orange. Some of them are blinking.

Agent: Alright, so we're getting some indicator lights there. That's a good sign. Let me have you try something for me. Can you unplug the modem from the power source?

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And just leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds while I'm looking into your account here. (typing sounds) I'm just checking to see if there have been any outages in your area reported.

Customer: Is there an outage? That would actually... that would make sense.

Agent: Let me see. I'm not showing any major outages in your zip code, but there could be some localized issues. Go ahead and plug that modem back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. It's booting back up.

Agent: Perfect. While we wait for that, James, can you tell me... do you see anything unusual with your equipment? Any damage, anything that looks out of place?

Customer: No, everything looks normal to me. The modem and router are just... they're in the same spot they've always been.

Agent: Okay, good. And how long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Uh, about two years now? Maybe a little longer.

Agent: Alright. And this is the first time you've experienced an outage like this?

Customer: Yeah, pretty much. I mean, maybe once or twice before, but nothing this long.

Agent: Understood. Okay, are the lights starting to look any different now?

Customer: (pause) Um, I'm still seeing mostly red. There's like... one green light now, but most of them are red or orange and blinking.

Agent: Okay. So we should be seeing mostly green lights once it's fully booted. This usually takes about two to three minutes. Let me have you check something else for me. Can you look at the cables coming out of the modem and just make sure they're all plugged in nice and tight?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at them now. There's the power cable, and then there's... (pause) oh, there's one that's a little loose. Let me tighten that.

Agent: Oh good catch! Go ahead and push that in all the way.

Customer: (pause) Okay, done. Anything else?

Agent: Let's give it just another minute or so to see if those lights change. Is your router also powered on?

Customer: Yeah, the router's on. It's got some lights too but... I don't know, it doesn't look much different.

Agent: That's alright. Sometimes the router takes a bit longer to sync up. (pause) So how many devices are you usually using at home?

Customer: Oh, um, just me usually. I've got my laptop, and my wife uses her phone. Nothing crazy.

Agent: Alright. Okay, James, can you check those lights on the modem again for me?

Customer: (pause) Um... still pretty red. Maybe slightly different but... not like, all green or anything.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me try something else. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? There should be a small button on the back.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see it. It's like a little recessed button, right?

Agent: That's the one. I'm going to have you hold that down for about ten seconds.

Customer: Okay, I'm holding it... (pause) ...still holding... (pause) okay, let go.

Agent: Perfect. That'll reset it. Now it's going to take a few minutes to fully reboot. While we wait... (typing sounds) I'm actually going to check something on our end. Can you tell me when the lights start turning green?

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) So far still mostly red.

Agent: Alright. (pause) James, I'm looking at your modem information here, and it's showing as registered to the network but I'm seeing some signal degradation. That's unusual. Can you tell me—do you have any splitters on your line? Like, is there anything between the wall outlet and your modem?

Customer: Uh, I don't think so? I just plug it straight in from the wall.

Agent: Okay, that's good. (pause) Alright, give me an update on those lights.

Customer: (pause) One just turned green actually. But there's still a lot of red.

Agent: Good, so we're getting some activity. Let's wait another minute or so. (typing sounds) In the meantime, I'm going to pull up some diagnostic information here.

Customer: (pause) Okay... um, Derek, like... how much longer do you think this is going to take? I really need to get my computer working.

Agent: I totally understand, James. These things can sometimes take a bit, but we're actively working on it. Should be just a few more minutes. (pause) Actually, you know what, can you check the modem one more time?

Customer: (pause) Okay, um... there's like two green lights now? But there's still, like, four or five that are red or orange.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm seeing something on my end here. It looks like your modem might not be syncing properly with our network. James, I'm going to need to have a technician come out and take a look at this. There might be an issue with the line itself or the equipment.

Customer: A technician? Like, when could they come out?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I can get someone out there... we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or Thursday afternoon after 2 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. Can you do that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got a technician appointment scheduled for tomorrow, March 15th, between 8 AM and noon. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine. Uh, what should I do until then?

Agent: Just leave the modem and router powered on. Don't do any other resets on it. The technician will take a look at everything when they arrive. They should be able to get you back up and running quickly.

Customer: Okay. And just... is there anything else I can try tonight or...?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, at this point it really does look like something that needs to be looked at in person. I wish I had a quick fix for you, but given what I'm seeing in your account, I think the technician visit is the best path forward.

Customer: Alright, yeah. I appreciate you trying anyway.

Agent: Of course, James. And I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. You're all set. Your confirmation number is 89-7734-TX. That'll be in your email shortly. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Take care, James.
