Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work I need to do from home and it's kind of urgent.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here. And can I get a name please?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got your account here. I'm showing you're on our Fiber 300 plan. So let me ask you a few quick questions. Is your modem powered on right now?

Customer: Yeah, it's... well, actually, I'm not sure. Let me look at it. (pause) Yeah, it's on. I can see the lights are on.

Agent: Okay, good. Can you tell me what color the lights are? Are they all green or...?

Customer: Um, there's a green light on the left, but then there's like a red light on the right that's blinking. Is that bad?

Agent: That red blinking light usually indicates there's no connection. Okay, so what I'd like you to do is unplug the modem from the power for about 30 seconds and then plug it back in. That'll do a restart.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Just wait about 30 seconds while it powers down completely.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Alright, it's been a bit. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm plugging it in now. So now we just wait?

Agent: Yeah, it should take about two to three minutes to fully boot up. While that's happening, can you tell me if you've had any recent storms or anything like that in your area?

Customer: No, nothing. The weather's been fine. It's been clear all week actually.

Agent: Alright. And when did you first notice the internet went down?

Customer: This morning, maybe around... I don't know, 8 or 8:30? I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing was loading.

Agent: Okay. So it's been a few hours now. (pause) Why don't you check on that modem for me? Do the lights look any different?

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah... the green light is still there but it's not blinking anymore. The red light is still blinking though. That's not... that doesn't seem good.

Agent: Hmm, okay. It should've come back online by now. Let me try something else. Can you tell me, do you have a gateway or a separate router as well?

Customer: I think... I'm not really sure what the difference is, but I just have the one box that the technician installed when they set everything up.

Agent: That's fine, that's the gateway modem. So that's the only device. Okay. Let me see here. (typing sounds) I'm going to check if we're showing any outages in your area.

Customer: Is that something that could affect... like, if there's an outage?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. If there's an outage on our end, that would explain why your internet isn't working. Let me just pull up that map here. (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, so that's not it.

Customer: So what does that mean? What's wrong with it then?

Agent: Well, there could be a few things. Let me have you try something. Can you locate the reset button on the back of the modem? It should be a small button, probably recessed.

Customer: (pause) Okay, um, I'm looking at the back... I see a lot of ports and stuff. Where exactly...?

Agent: It'll be a small button, probably white or black. You might need to use a paperclip or a pen to press it.

Customer: Oh, I think I see it. There's a tiny button here. Is it the one that says "Reset"?

Agent: Yes, that's the one. Now, I want to warn you, pressing this is going to completely reset your modem to factory settings, so we'll lose your WiFi name and password. You'll need to reconfigure everything after.

Customer: Okay, well, I'm willing to try anything at this point. Should I do it?

Agent: Go ahead. Press and hold it for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... (pause) How long now?

Agent: About 5 more seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, releasing it now. (pause) It's like... all the lights went off and they're coming back on now.

Agent: Good. That's normal. It's rebooting. This'll take a few minutes again.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so while we're waiting... is there anything else that could be causing this?

Agent: Well, it could be a physical issue with the line, a problem with the modem itself, or it could even be an issue at the node level. But let's see if the reset fixes it first.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm looking at it again. Um... I'm getting the same thing. Green light, red light blinking.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's... that's not what we want to see. Let me try one more thing here. I'm going to check your account to see if there's anything on our end that might be blocking the connection.

Customer: Like what? What would block it?

Agent: Could be anything from a service suspension to some kind of provisioning issue. Let me just... (typing sounds) Hmm, no, your account looks good. Everything's active. There are no holds or anything like that.

Customer: So what now?

Agent: I think at this point, Michael, what we're dealing with is likely a hardware issue with your modem, or potentially a line issue that I can't diagnose from here. I think the best next step would be to get a technician out to your location to do an on-site inspection.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet working today if possible.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at our schedule for today, and unfortunately we're pretty booked up. The earliest I can get someone out would be tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Or we do have a late window tomorrow, between 5 and 8 PM.

Customer: That's not today though.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for that. The demand for service calls is pretty high right now. But given that we've tried the basic troubleshooting steps and a full reset, I'm fairly confident that a technician visit will resolve this for you.

Customer: I mean, is there anything else we can try right now? I really can't wait until tomorrow.

Agent: (pause) Well, I could have you try power cycling one more time, but honestly, I think we've exhausted what I can do remotely. The red light typically indicates a line problem or a modem failure, and neither of those are things we can fix over the phone.

Customer: (pause) Okay, well... I guess I'll have to do the tomorrow appointment then.

Agent: I'm going to go ahead and schedule that for you. Would the 1 to 5 PM window work better, or do you prefer the evening slot?

Customer: Um, I guess 1 to 5 is better. I don't want to wait until evening.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to put you down for tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. And Michael, I'm going to add a credit to your account for the service outage time. It's not much, but it's $10 to your next bill.

Customer: I appreciate that, but... yeah, I just really need the internet working tomorrow.

Agent: Absolutely. And I want to let you know that if the technician finds it's a modem issue, we'll replace it at no charge. If it's a line issue, we'll repair that as well, all covered under your service plan.

Customer: Okay, that's good to know.

Agent: You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with your appointment details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's... that's it. I mean, hopefully the technician can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident they will. Again, I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved for you today, Michael. Thank you for being patient with us, and thanks for choosing Frontier.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Take care. Goodbye.
