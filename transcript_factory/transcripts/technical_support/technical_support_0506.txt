# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls at 2 o'clock and nothing's connecting.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that is. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my cell phone number on file.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing you're on our Fiber 500 plan at 892 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Okay, so you've been without internet since this morning. Have you tried doing a hard restart on your modem yet?

Customer: Oh, um, no I haven't actually. Where's that? Do I just turn it off?

Agent: Yeah, it's pretty simple. So you should see a device, probably black or white, it looks kinda like a small box with some lights on it. Do you have that?

Customer: Oh yeah, I see it. It's on the shelf by my router. So I just... turn it off?

Agent: Exactly. Just unplug it from the wall, wait about thirty seconds, then plug it back in. While you're doing that, I can stay on the line with you.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, waiting... This better work because I've got so much going on today.

Agent: I hear you. (pause) Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. Now what? There's lights coming on... they're all red right now.

Agent: That's normal. It takes a minute or so to boot back up. While that's happening, let me ask you a few questions. Have there been any recent storms in your area or any construction work going on?

Customer: Um, no storms that I know of. Although, there was some cable work on the street yesterday. They were doing something with the lines out front. You think that could be it?

Agent: It's definitely possible. That could have damaged something in the line. But let's see if we can get your modem back up first. Are you seeing any green lights yet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, one's green now. Let me wait... okay, two lights are green. But they're still kinda flickering.

Agent: Alright, give it another minute to fully stabilize. Are you getting any lights on your router as well?

Customer: (pause) The router lights aren't turning on at all. Is that bad?

Agent: Not necessarily. Sometimes the router needs its own restart. But first, can you tell me if your modem is showing a solid green light on the internet indicator? It should say "Internet" next to it.

Customer: Um, let me look... I see like... power, internet, phone... The internet one is... it's still flickering between green and red.

Agent: Okay, that flickering is telling me there might be an issue with the connection coming into your home. Let me check on our end here. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a line test on your account. One moment. (pause) Hmm, I'm not seeing a strong signal coming through on your line. It's showing pretty degraded.

Customer: What does that mean? Is it something I did?

Agent: No, no, it's not something you did. This is on our infrastructure side. Given what you mentioned about the cable work yesterday, I'm thinking there might be a break or loose connection somewhere on the line that leads to your house. This would require a technician to come out and investigate.

Customer: A technician? How long would that take? I really need this working today.

Agent: I understand. Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) I'm checking our service schedule right now... I might be able to get someone out to you this afternoon, actually. But I need to try one more thing first. Can you check the cable connection at the back of your modem? Where the coax cable plugs in?

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause) I see it. It's... it looks like it's in there pretty tight.

Agent: Okay, good. Just give it a gentle tug to make sure it's seated all the way. Sometimes they can come loose.

Customer: (pause) I'm tugging it... It might have been a tiny bit loose? I'm not sure. Anything different on your end?

Agent: (pause) Let me check... (typing sounds) No, I'm still not reading any improvement on the signal strength. That's unfortunately pointing to an external line issue. I think we're going to need to get a technician out to you.

Customer: Okay, so what do I do? How does that work?

Agent: So I can schedule that for you right now. I'm showing we have availability this afternoon between 1 and 3 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Between 1 and 3? But my call is at 2 o'clock...

Agent: I apologize for that conflict. Let me see if there's any other availability. (typing sounds) (pause) The next open slot would be tomorrow morning between 8 and 10 AM. Or I could put you on a priority list for a cancellation this afternoon, but I can't guarantee anything there.

Customer: This is... this is really not ideal. Can't you guys send someone right now? Like in the next hour?

Agent: (pause) I wish I could expedite it further. Unfortunately, all our afternoon slots are booked, and 1 to 3 is our earliest availability. The technician might arrive earlier than 2 o'clock though. It's not guaranteed, but it's possible.

Customer: (frustrated) Alright, fine. Put me down for that 1 to 3 slot. At least I'll try to reschedule my call if I can.

Agent: I really appreciate your understanding. So I have you scheduled for today between 1 and 3 PM. The technician will come out and check the line. In the meantime, is there anything else I can try? Have you got a smartphone with data you could possibly use for your 2 o'clock call?

Customer: I mean, I guess I could do that, but the whole point of having Frontier is so I don't have to worry about burning through my data. And my work video calls need better connection than that anyway.

Agent: That's totally fair. I'm sorry we're dealing with this today. Um, what I can do is apply a courtesy credit to your account for the service interruption. Let me put that through... (typing sounds) Okay, I've applied a $15 credit for today. It should show up on your next bill.

Customer: (pause) I mean... I appreciate that, but I really just need the internet working.

Agent: I completely understand. And I want to assure you that our technician will get this sorted out. They're really good at diagnosing these kinds of issues, especially ones related to external line damage. You should be back up and running by this afternoon.

Customer: Okay. So they'll call before they show up, right? Or do they just... show up?

Agent: They typically call about 30 minutes before they arrive. You'll get a call from our dispatch. And just to confirm, the best number to reach you is the 555-0847?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell. That's fine.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just read back your appointment details here. You're scheduled for today, [inaudible], between 1 and 3 PM at 892 Maple Street for a line investigation and repair. The technician will call you 30 minutes prior to arrival.

Customer: Yep, that's right.

Agent: Great. And I've also got your $15 service credit applied. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (sighs) No, I guess that's it. I just hope they can fix it.

Agent: I'm confident they will. And I'm sorry again for the inconvenience. If you have any issues or need to reach us again, you can always call back or check your account online.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll get you back online real soon.

Customer: Alright, bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
