Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're on our 500 megabit fiber plan. And you're saying your internet went down this morning?

Customer: Yeah, it was working fine last night, and then when I woke up around 8 AM, nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Alright. Let's start with the basics. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Do you have a modem and router set up?

Customer: Yeah, I have both. Um, the modem has some lights on it, but I'm not really sure what they're supposed to mean. The internet light or whatever—I think it's red? Or maybe orange?

Agent: Okay, so the internet light is red or orange. That's actually what I'd expect to see if there's no connection coming in. Is there a power light that's on and green?

Customer: Um, yeah. The power light is green. That one's solid.

Agent: Good, good. That's a start. And your router—do you see any lights on that as well?

Customer: (pause) The router is... yeah, it's got a few lights but they're all kind of dim or flashing. I'm not sure.

Agent: Alright, here's what I want to try first. Can you go ahead and unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. It's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. While that's unplugged, go ahead and unplug the router as well.

Customer: (pause) Got it. Both unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about 30 seconds while everything powers down completely. I'm gonna check a couple things on my end here.

Customer: Okay... (background noise, pause) How much longer?

Agent: Go ahead and count to about 30 in your head. It doesn't have to be exact.

Customer: Alright, it's been about 30 seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now plug the modem back in first, and then wait about two minutes for it to fully boot up before you plug in the router.

Customer: (pause) Modem's plugged back in. I'll wait for it to boot up... (pause) Okay, it looks like it's... there are more lights on now. Is that good?

Agent: That's good, that's normal. Now go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, router's back in.

Agent: Great. Now give that about 30 more seconds to a minute to boot up. While we're waiting, can I ask—did you experience any storms last night? Any power outages or anything like that?

Customer: Um, there was some rain and wind, but I don't think the power went out. I mean, nothing was unplugged or anything.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Do you have any lights on the router now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's a blue light now. And it's solid, I think. Not blinking.

Agent: Excellent. That's usually a good sign. Do you have a computer or phone you can test the connection on?

Customer: Yeah, I'm holding my phone right now. Let me see if I can connect. Um... (pause) It's not showing any available networks. That's weird.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Can you tell me the model of your router? It should be on a label on the back or bottom.

Customer: (pause) It says... Frontier FiberRouter 3000. Does that help?

Agent: That does help, thank you. Okay, so we should be seeing your network name pop up. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds, pause) I'm not seeing any active connection coming into your equipment right now, which tells me the issue might be outside the house or with the line itself.

Customer: Oh no, really? So it's not something I did wrong?

Agent: No, no—you're doing everything right. This sounds more like a line-side issue. Let me try something else. Do you have an ethernet cable? Something you could plug directly into the modem?

Customer: I... I think I have one somewhere. Hold on. (pause, background rummaging) Okay, I found one. Where do I plug it in?

Agent: There should be a port on the back of the modem labeled "Ethernet" or it might say "LAN." It'll be a small rectangular port.

Customer: (pause) Um, I see... yeah, there's one here. (pause) Okay, plugged in.

Agent: Perfect. Now grab a computer or laptop if you have one, and plug the other end of that cable into the ethernet port.

Customer: Okay, just a second. (pause) Got it plugged in. Now what?

Agent: Now try opening a web browser on that computer. Just try going to any website—Google, or anything like that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm... nothing's loading. It's just... spinning, like it's trying to connect but nothing's happening.

Agent: (pause) Alright. I'm gonna be honest with you—at this point, I'm not getting any signal coming from our network to your address. It's looking like there may be a break in the fiber line somewhere, either on our infrastructure or possibly on your property line.

Customer: Wait, so what does that mean? Can you guys fix it?

Agent: Well, that's definitely something we can send a technician out to look at. They'd be able to identify exactly where the break is and get it repaired. But before we schedule that, let me just try one more thing. Have you checked your equipment to make sure nothing got physically damaged or unplugged?

Customer: I mean, I looked around, but... I don't really know what I'm looking for, to be honest.

Agent: Fair enough. (pause) Is there any equipment outside your house? Like maybe a box on the wall or on a pole near your house?

Customer: Oh, yeah, there's a box mounted on the outside of the house. By the front door. Is that something I should check?

Agent: Yes, actually. Can you take a look and see if there are any cables that look disconnected or damaged? Any water in the box, anything like that?

Customer: (pause, sounds of door opening) Okay, I'm looking at it now. (pause) Everything looks... dry and connected to me. I don't see anything obviously wrong.

Agent: Alright, that's good. Look, based on everything we've tried, I think we're going to need to send a technician out to your location. They'll be able to pinpoint exactly what's going on with the line.

Customer: How long is that going to take? I really need my internet for work.

Agent: I understand. Let me check our availability here. (typing sounds, pause) We have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or later this week on Thursday. What works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow is fine. That's better than waiting until Thursday.

Agent: Perfect. That's actually great. Let me get that scheduled for you. So that's tomorrow, July 15th, between 8 and noon. Can you make sure someone's home?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Excellent. You'll get a confirmation text and email within the next hour. The technician will also call 15 minutes before they arrive. Their reference number is going to be 847592. Make sure you have that handy.

Customer: Okay, I got it. 847592. So... is there anything else I can do in the meantime?

Agent: You can try the power cycle again if you want, but honestly, if the line is damaged, that won't help. Just keep an eye on your equipment and make sure nothing changes. If by chance you get a connection before the technician arrives, just give us a call back and let us know.

Customer: Alright, I will. And you said I'll get a text and email?

Agent: Yes, both. They should come through within an hour. And if you have any questions before the technician arrives, you can always call back and we can take a look at your account.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I appreciate your help.

Agent: You're very welcome. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone, but our technician will definitely get you sorted out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. We'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
