# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here really quick so I can help you get back online. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet went out about an hour ago? Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Um, let me look. The modem has... okay, so the power light is on, but like, all the other lights are off. Normally there's a lot more blinking going on.

Agent: Okay, that's actually a really good observation. So the power is on but you're not seeing any activity lights. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem from the power for about thirty seconds? Just pull the cord out completely.

Customer: Sure, one sec. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just... just let it sit there for thirty seconds. (pause) I'm going to check something on my end while we wait. (typing sounds) So I'm looking at your account and it looks like... okay, the last activity we have from your modem was actually about an hour and fifteen minutes ago, so that lines up with what you're saying.

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that's about right.

Agent: Alright. Has your internet been working normally up until today? Any issues recently?

Customer: No, it's been fine. Really good actually. This just happened out of nowhere.

Agent: Okay, good to know. And you said you unplugged the modem—is it unplugged now?

Customer: Yeah, still unplugged.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Okay, now what I want you to do is wait about three minutes for it to fully boot back up. During that time, the lights should come back on. Do you see any lights turning on right now?

Customer: Um... the power light is on, and now I'm seeing a... there's like an orange light that just came on?

Agent: Okay, that's normal. That's typically a startup light. Give it just a couple more minutes. In the meantime, let me ask you about your router. Do you have a separate router or are you using the combined modem and router unit?

Customer: I have a separate one. It's like a black box sitting next to the modem.

Agent: Okay, perfect. Is that router powered on?

Customer: Yeah, it's... wait, actually, is it supposed to be blinking right now? It's blinking a lot more than it usually does.

Agent: That's normal during startup too. Just give it another minute or so. (pause) While we're waiting, let me ask—did anything happen before the internet went out? Like, did you experience a storm, lose power, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just... I was working and then I noticed I couldn't refresh my email, so I walked over to check the modem and... yeah, nothing.

Agent: Okay, so it was pretty sudden. Alright, let's check on those lights again. What are you seeing now?

Customer: Um, let me look. (pause) Okay, so the power light's solid, and I'm seeing some green lights now?

Agent: Great! That's a really good sign. The green lights mean the modem is connecting. Do you want to try connecting to your WiFi on your computer or phone and see if you can get online?

Customer: Yeah, let me try my phone. (pause) Okay, I'm... I'm connecting to the WiFi network. (pause) It's connecting... (pause) Okay, it connected but I don't have internet. The WiFi is there but I can't actually browse anything.

Agent: Hmm, okay. So you're connected to the network but no internet access. Let me ask you a few things. Are you seeing all the lights on the modem now? Like, is there a light that typically indicates internet connection?

Customer: There should be... let me look. There's like a phone light, an internet light, and a power light. The power's on, the phone light is on, but the internet light is... it's like not fully green? It's like a dim green.

Agent: Okay, a dim green could mean it's still initializing, or it could indicate a connection issue. Let me check something on this end. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your modem is registering on our network now, which is good, but the signal strength seems a little low. Have you moved your modem recently, or is it in the same place it always is?

Customer: It's in the same spot. It's been there for like six months.

Agent: Okay. Let's try another reboot of the modem. Sometimes that helps reinitialize the connection. Can you unplug it again for me?

Customer: (sighing) Sure, yeah. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Alright, same thing—thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Yep, counting it down. (pause) Okay, it should be... (pause) Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Let's give it another couple of minutes to boot up. (pause) While it's starting up, let me ask you about your cables. Is the coaxial cable—that's the thick cable that comes from the wall into the modem—is that connected pretty tight?

Customer: I... I'm not really sure. I mean, it looks connected to me. It's like screwed on, right?

Agent: Yeah, exactly. It should screw on. If you get a chance, can you try unscrewing it just a tiny bit and screwing it back in? Sometimes they can get a little loose and it affects the signal.

Customer: Okay, sure. (pause) It's... hold on, let me reach back there. (pause) Okay, I'm unscrewing it. (pause) Actually, I notice it feels like it's pretty loose now that I'm... okay, I'm tightening it back up. It's pretty snug now.

Agent: Excellent catch! That could definitely be the issue. Let's see if that helps. Let me check the modem on our end. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm getting better signal from your modem now. That's fantastic. Try connecting to your WiFi again and see if you can get online.

Customer: Okay, let me try my phone again. (pause) Yeah, I'm connecting... (pause) It's connected to the network but... I'm still not getting internet. I'm trying to load a website and it's just... it's not loading.

Agent: Hmm, still nothing. Okay. Let me have you try something. Can you do a quick test on a computer if you have one? Sometimes phones can cache network issues.

Customer: Yeah, I have a laptop right here. Give me a second. (pause) Okay, I'm connecting to the WiFi. (pause) Connected. Trying to load Google now... (pause) Nope. Nothing's loading.

Agent: Okay. So the modem is connecting but there's no actual internet data coming through. Let me check the modem diagnostics on my end. (typing sounds) (long pause) (typing sounds) That's... that's odd. Okay, so on our end, I'm seeing that the modem has a connection to our network, but we're not getting an IP address assignment to your device. That's usually a router issue, actually.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: So basically, your modem is talking to our network fine, but your router isn't properly communicating with the modem. Let me have you try resetting your router. On the back, there's usually a small button that says Reset. Do you see that?

Customer: Let me look... (pause) Yeah, I see a small button. It says Reset on it.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so this one's a little trickier. You're going to need a paperclip or something small to press it. It's going to restart the router. Are you ready?

Customer: Yeah, I got a paperclip. (pause) Okay, ready. (pause) Pressing it. (pause) And it's restarting. I can see the lights going off.

Agent: Good. Let that fully restart—it should take about two to three minutes. (pause) So while that's happening, let me just... (typing sounds) I'm checking a few things on the backend here. (pause) Okay, I'm going to check if there's maybe a service issue in your area. (pause) (pause) No, I'm not seeing any reported outages anywhere near your location.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it definitely the router?

Agent: Well, it could be the router, or it could be a connection issue between the modem and the router. Sometimes the cable connecting them gets loose too, or occasionally there can be an issue with the modem itself. Let's see if the router reset helps first. Are the lights back on the router?

Customer: Yeah, they're coming back on now. Some blinking. (pause) Okay, they seem to be settling down. Should I try connecting again?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and try your laptop again.

Customer: (pause) Connecting... (pause) Connected to the network. Let me try to load a page. (pause) Trying Google... (pause) [inaudible] Still nothing. This is really weird.

Agent: I know, I'm sorry. This is definitely frustrating. Okay, let me try one more thing. I'm going to reset your modem from our end. That's different from unplugging it—this is a full remote reset. It's going to take a few minutes, and you might see your lights do some strange things, but that's normal. Alright?

Customer: Okay, yeah, go ahead.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I've initiated the reset. You should see some activity on the modem in a second. (pause) Seeing anything?

Customer: Yeah, the lights are... they're all going off and back on. It's rebooting I guess.

Agent: (pause) Yep, that's exactly right. (pause) Okay, let's give this about three minutes to fully complete. (pause) You know, I've been doing this for about four years now, and sometimes these resets are really effective. Fingers crossed. (pause) So while we wait, have you had any issues with your service in the past? Any intermittent outages or anything?

Customer: No, nothing. It's actually been really reliable, which is why this is so weird.

Agent: That's good to hear. Reliable service is what we're going for. Okay, I think we should be about ready now. What are the lights looking like on the modem?

Customer: They're pretty much all green now. Just the power, phone, and internet lights. All green.

Agent: Perfect. That's exactly what we want to see. Alright, try your laptop one more time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm connecting to the WiFi... (pause) Connected. Trying to load Google. (pause) (long pause) No, still nothing. It's not working.

Agent: Still no luck. Okay, I... (pause) I'm going to be honest with you here. We've tried a lot of the standard troubleshooting steps, and I'm not seeing a clear resolution coming from what I can do remotely. The modem is definitely connecting to our network, but the data isn't getting through to your devices. This could indicate a few different things—it could be an issue with the modem itself, it could be an issue with the router, or it could be a line issue we need to investigate on our end.

Customer: So what do I do?

Agent: Well, I think at this point we need to get a technician out to your house to do a physical inspection. They can check all the cables, test the signal strength directly, and if there's a hardware issue with the modem or router, they can replace it. How does your schedule look? Are you able to be home for an appointment?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I work from home, so... I'm always here. When could they come out?

Agent: Let me check availability. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing... we have availability tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we have Thursday morning between 8 AM and noon. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon is fine. That works.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule that for you. So that's tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM at your address on Maple Street. The technician will give you a call about thirty minutes before they arrive. I'm also going to put a note on your account that we've done extensive remote troubleshooting, so they'll know where we left off.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. So there's nothing else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: Um... (pause) You could try one more time with just the modem. If you unplug the modem, wait a full minute this time, and plug it back in, sometimes that helps. But I wouldn't spend too much time on it. The technician will be able to figure it out much faster in person.

Customer: Alright. Well, I guess I'll just wait until tomorrow then. This is really annoying because I have a bunch of work I need to do online.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. We'll get you back up and running as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. So I just wait for the call tomorrow?

Agent: Yep, exactly. Just look for the technician's call about thirty minutes before their arrival window. And if anything changes or you want to cancel, you can give us a call back anytime.

Customer: Okay, thanks. I appreciate the help.

Agent: No problem at all. Thanks for being patient with us, and sorry again for the trouble. We'll get this resolved tomorrow. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
