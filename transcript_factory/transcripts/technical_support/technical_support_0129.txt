# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing your account here. So your internet service went down this morning, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 AM. I was just sitting here working and then suddenly everything just... stopped. The WiFi just disappeared.

Agent: Alright, let's get this sorted out for you. First, I want to walk through some basic troubleshooting. Can you check your modem right now? It should be the device with the lights on it. Do you see it?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I'm looking at it now. It's, um... (pause) the lights are all red. Is that bad?

Agent: Red lights can indicate a few different things. Let me walk you through this. Okay, what I want you to do is unplug the modem from the power outlet. Just pull the power cord out.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds while we let it fully power down. Just... just give it a moment.

Customer: Alright. (long pause) Thirty seconds feel like a long time when your internet's down, you know?

Agent: (slight chuckle) I hear you. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (sound of plugging in device) Okay, it's back in. Now what?

Agent: Now we're just gonna let it boot back up. This usually takes a minute or two. You should see the lights start to change. What are you seeing?

Customer: Um, okay, so they're starting to... turn orange now? And there's one that's blinking green.

Agent: Okay, good. That's progress. The blinking green is good—that means it's trying to establish a connection. Let's give it another minute or so to fully boot up.

Customer: (pause) Okay. How long have you been with Frontier, if you don't mind me asking?

Agent: Oh, me? (laughs) About three years now. Been taking calls pretty much that whole time. But hey, let's focus on getting you back online. What are the lights showing now?

Customer: Um, still blinking. The orange one is still there, though. Shouldn't it be... I don't know, a different color by now?

Agent: The orange light can sometimes take a bit longer. Let's give it just another 30 seconds. While we're waiting, let me ask—have you made any changes to your setup recently? New router, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. Everything's been the same for like... six months now? Maybe longer. It was working fine yesterday.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. (pause) Alright, what are we seeing now on the modem?

Customer: (pause) Same thing. Orange and green blinking. But I'm still not getting any WiFi on my laptop.

Agent: Right, okay. Let me try a different approach here. I'm going to need you to do a factory reset on your modem. This is a little more involved than just unplugging it, okay?

Customer: What do you mean, a factory reset? Will I lose anything?

Agent: No, you won't lose anything important. It'll just restore the modem to its default settings. We can reconfigure everything. Can you locate the reset button? It's usually a small hole on the back or bottom of the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking... yeah, I see it. It's a tiny little button.

Agent: Perfect. You're gonna need something like a paperclip or a pin to push it because it's recessed. Go ahead and hold that button for about 10 seconds.

Customer: Okay, just... holding it down. (pause) It's been like 10 seconds, should I stop?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and release it.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Now what? Did anything happen?

Agent: You should see the lights cycle through different colors. It might turn red or orange, and it'll basically restart itself. This might take a couple minutes.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, I'm... I'm watching it. The lights are doing something different now, but I'm still not seeing WiFi pop up on my devices.

Agent: Okay, that's... that's still part of the boot-up process. Let's give it another minute. What does your modem look like, by the way? Is it the white box or the black one?

Customer: It's white.

Agent: Okay, so it's probably one of our newer models then. Those usually take a bit longer to boot up after a reset. Let's just... let's give it a little more time.

Customer: (pause, sounds of frustrated sighing) [inaudible] ...can't believe this is happening today. I have a meeting at 10.

Agent: I understand, and I'm gonna do everything I can to get you back online. (pause) Okay, what are we showing now?

Customer: Um, okay, so now I'm seeing... it looks like one solid green light and one solid orange light. But still no WiFi showing up on my devices.

Agent: Let me check on something from my end. (typing sounds) Let me see... Okay, so I'm looking at the signal coming from your address, and I'm... I'm not showing a strong connection to the network. 

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: That could mean a few things. It could be an issue with the line coming into your house, or there might be something happening on our network in your area. Um, have you noticed any damage outside your home? Any wires that look out of place?

Customer: I... I mean, I didn't really look. It was cold this morning so I didn't go outside much.

Agent: Could you do me a favor and just take a quick look? I know it's cold, but it might be helpful. Just check around your house to see if you notice anything unusual with the cables coming in.

Customer: (sounds of moving around, door opening, wind noise) (pause) Okay, um, I'm outside. Everything looks... pretty normal to me? I see the cable box and some wires, but nothing's hanging or anything.

Agent: Alright, good. Well, that's—that's good news. Go ahead and come back inside.

Customer: (door closing, pause) Okay, I'm back. So what now?

Agent: So here's what I'm thinking. We might be dealing with an issue on the network side—something at our infrastructure level. Let me try to restart your service from this end. I'm gonna need you to stay on the line with me for just a moment. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm gonna restart your connection now. This might cause your modem to cycle through its lights again, which is totally normal.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Yep, it's doing something. The lights just went dark for a second.

Agent: Good, that's what should happen. Okay, just let me know when you see the lights come back on and stabilize.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, they're back on. Still got that orange and the green blinking, though. [inaudible] How long is this supposed to take?

Agent: It should be... it should be showing a connection by now, honestly. (pause, typing sounds) Let me... let me check something on my end again. (longer pause) Hmm. I'm not showing your modem connecting to the network on our systems either. That's odd.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It could be a configuration issue, or there might be something happening with your line from the node in your area. Um, I hate to say this, but I think we might need to get a technician out to your place to diagnose this properly.

Customer: A technician? How long would that take?

Agent: Well, let me check the availability. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so the earliest I can get someone out is tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need this working today. I have work to do.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry about that. Unfortunately, we don't have any technicians available today in your area, but I can see if we can bump you up to a priority appointment tomorrow morning if you'd like. Would somewhere between 10 AM and noon work?

Customer: I guess that'll have to do. But there's no way to fix this today?

Agent: Well, let me try one more thing before we resort to booking a technician. Sometimes there's a provisioning issue in the system. Let me try to reprovision your modem. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm going to push a signal to your modem now. This should take just a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay. (longer pause) Nope. Still the same. No WiFi.

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately I'm not seeing that connect either. I really think we need that technician to look at the physical line. There might be something with your connection point, or there could be damage somewhere that I can't diagnose from here.

Customer: (sighs) This is really frustrating.

Agent: I know, and I'm genuinely sorry we couldn't get you up and running today. But I do want to get you that priority appointment tomorrow morning. Can I get a good callback number?

Customer: It's the same number on file, 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm gonna schedule a technician to come out tomorrow, Tuesday, between 10 AM and noon. We'll do our best to get there earlier if we can. You'll get a confirmation text and email tonight. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I guess that's... that's it. I just hope they can actually fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident they'll get to the bottom of it. Our technicians are really good, and if there's an issue with your line, they'll find it. Again, I apologize we couldn't resolve this today, and thank you for your patience while we worked through the troubleshooting steps.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day, and we'll see you tomorrow morning. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye.
