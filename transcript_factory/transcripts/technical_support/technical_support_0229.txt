Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got important work I need to do and I'm kind of freaking out here.

Agent: I understand, I'm sorry you're experiencing that. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. One second... Alright, I've got you here. And your name is David, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned the internet just stopped working about an hour ago. Were you using it normally when it went out, or did something happen? Like a power outage or anything like that?

Customer: No, no power outage or anything. I was just sitting here working from home and suddenly I noticed all my browser tabs had that, you know, "no internet" error. I wasn't doing anything special, just checking emails and stuff.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. And just to confirm, you're not able to access the internet on any devices right now? Did you try multiple devices?

Customer: Yeah, I tried my laptop and my phone, and neither one is working. So it's definitely not like a single device issue.

Agent: Right, good troubleshooting on your part. So first thing I'd like you to do is locate your modem and router. Can you see them from where you are?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, hold on. (rustling sounds) Okay, I see my modem and router. They're both in the living room.

Agent: Great. What I need you to do is tell me what lights you're seeing on the modem right now. Are there any lights lit up?

Customer: Um... (pause) Let me look closely here. There's... I see a green light on the power, but everything else is kind of... red or orange? Like, the internet light looks red.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on, but the internet indicator is red. That definitely tells us something. Have you tried unplugging the modem yet to do a restart?

Customer: No, I haven't tried that. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, let's give it a shot. Go ahead and unplug the modem from the wall outlet. Just wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. I'll be right here.

Customer: (rustling, background noise) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. I'm just gonna count to thirty... (longer pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now we're gonna let it boot back up. This usually takes about two to three minutes. While we're waiting, let me also ask—is your router showing any lights, or is that powered on as well?

Customer: Yeah, the router's on. It's got like, blue lights on it. They're blinking, which I think is normal?

Agent: That's actually good, yes. The blue lights and blinking are what we want to see. (pause) And we're about a minute in on the modem restart. How's that looking now?

Customer: Um, let me see... The power light is still green, but the internet light is still red. That's not good, right?

Agent: Well, let's give it another minute or so. Sometimes it takes a little longer. While we wait, I'm also going to check on our end if there are any service outages in your area. Can I get your service address?

Customer: Sure, it's 4827 Maple Drive, in Salem.

Agent: (typing sounds) 4827 Maple Drive, Salem. Got it. (pause) Okay, and I'm not seeing any widespread outages in your area right now, so that's good news. Let's check on that modem again. Is the internet light still red?

Customer: Yeah, it's... still red. I mean, nothing's changed.

Agent: Alright, let me have you try something else. Can you check the back of the modem and see if there's a cable connection where the internet comes in? It should look like a thicker cable, kind of like a phone line but wider.

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) You mean like the coaxial cable? Is that what you're talking about?

Agent: Exactly, the coaxial cable. Yes. Can you check if it's plugged in securely? Sometimes these can get a little loose.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Let me look back there. The cable looks like it's... hmm, actually it doesn't look super tight. Like, I can see a little bit of space between the connector and the modem. Let me try to tighten it. (sound of twisting) Okay, I'm twisting it... a little tighter... there we go. It's snug now.

Agent: Good. Now let's unplug the modem one more time and do another restart. Let's see if that makes a difference.

Customer: Okay. (unplugging sounds) Unplugging... (pause) ...and waiting... (longer pause) ...plugging back in now.

Agent: Alright, let's give it another couple minutes.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... I'm watching the lights... and the power's on but I'm still seeing red on the internet light. Is this... is this bad?

Agent: (pause) It's unusual that it's not coming back up. Let me try a couple more things. Can you take a look at the cable itself, the coaxial cable? Is there any visible damage to it? Any kinks, cuts, or anything like that?

Customer: (rustling) No, it looks fine from what I can see. It's just a regular cable.

Agent: Okay. And the modem is still showing red on the internet light?

Customer: Yeah, still red.

Agent: Let me place you on a very brief hold while I check a few things on my end and see if maybe there's something happening with your service line. It'll just be a moment.

Customer: Sure, okay.

Agent: (hold music, about 30 seconds)

Agent: Alright, David, I'm back. So I ran a line test on your account and I'm not seeing any signal coming through on your service line, which would explain why the modem can't connect.

Customer: What does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: Not necessarily. It could be the modem, or it could be an issue with the service line coming into your house. Since we're not seeing any signal, there might be a problem with the outside connection. There could be a bad splice, a cut line, or the signal just isn't reaching your home for some reason.

Customer: So what do we do? Can you fix it?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, what we're looking at here would require a technician to come out and do an on-site inspection. That's beyond what I can troubleshoot over the phone. I can definitely set up a service appointment for you.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back, like, today if possible.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) So the earliest I can get someone out there is... actually, we do have an opening this evening, around 5 to 7 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, that's not ideal, but I can make that work. Do I need to be there?

Agent: Yes, you'll need to be home for the technician to access your equipment and the outside line. They'll diagnose the issue and either replace or repair whatever needs to be fixed.

Customer: Okay, alright. Yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. So I have you down for this evening between 5 and 7 PM. The tech's name will be [inaudible], and I'm gonna email you a confirmation with all the details. Is the email on file still good?

Customer: Um, yeah, I think so. What is it?

Agent: (typing) I have david.martinez@email.com. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's it.

Agent: Great. I'm sending that over now. You should get it in a few minutes. And in the meantime, I'm really sorry about this inconvenience. Hopefully, the technician will be able to get you back up and running this evening.

Customer: Okay, thanks. I mean, I wish we could have fixed it over the phone, but I appreciate your help.

Agent: I know, I wish we could have too. But unfortunately, when there's no signal coming in from outside, that's definitely a field visit. The good news is our team is really good at diagnosing these things. They'll get you squared away.

Customer: Alright, well, I guess I'll see them this evening then.

Agent: Sounds good. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome, David. Thank you for calling Frontier, and sorry again for the trouble.

Customer: No problem. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
