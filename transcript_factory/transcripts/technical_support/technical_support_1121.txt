Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet went out sometime this morning and I've been trying to figure it out on my own, but nothing's working. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me just pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I see you're on our fiber service. So when you say your internet went out, did you lose connection completely, or is it just running really slow?

Customer: No, it's completely out. Like, nothing. I can't get online at all. My computer says there's no internet connection, and I tried my phone too—won't connect.

Agent: Alright, let's start with the basics. Can you take a look at your modem and router for me? I need you to tell me what lights you're seeing on the front of them.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... I'm looking at the modem right now. It's got some lights on it. Let me see... there's a power light that's on, it's green. And then there's... (pause) ...there's a couple other lights that look like they might be red?

Agent: Okay, red lights, that's helpful information. Can you describe which lights are red? Is it the internet light, or the connection light, or...?

Customer: Uh, I'm not really sure which one is which, to be honest. I don't know what all these lights mean. There's definitely a green one and then I see... it looks like maybe two red ones?

Agent: No problem, I get that all the time. So the most important one to check would be the one labeled "Internet" or sometimes it says "Online." Is there one that says that?

Customer: (pause) Let me look closer. Um... yeah, I think I see one that might say "Online" but it's hard to read. And that one's... that one looks red to me.

Agent: That red light on the Online port would explain why you don't have connectivity. Have you tried unplugging the modem yet? Sometimes a simple restart can fix the issue.

Customer: No, I haven't done that yet. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and do that for me. Just unplug the power cable from the back of the modem, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. Then we'll see if those lights change.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Unplugging now. (pause) Alright, it's off. The lights are all dark. I'm waiting... (pause) ...another few seconds... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now. (sounds of plugging in device) Okay, power's back on.

Agent: Good. Now, while that's booting back up, can you also check your router? Is there a separate device from the modem, or do you have a combination unit?

Customer: There's... I think they're separate? I have the modem, and then there's another box next to it.

Agent: That would be your router. Go ahead and unplug that one too, wait 30 seconds, and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Doing that now. Okay, both are plugged back in. (pause) Uh, so the modem lights are... they're turning on again. I see the green power light is back. And... (pause) ...it looks like other lights are coming on too. Let me wait a sec for it to fully boot up.

Agent: Take your time. These can take a minute or so to fully initialize.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... I'm still seeing what looks like a red light on that Online thing. It's not green yet.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's unusual. The light usually turns green within a few minutes of a restart. Let me check your service status on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any outages in your area, so that's good news. But let me ask you—do you see any physical damage to the cables going into the modem? Any loose connections or anything that looks off?

Customer: (pause) Let me look. No, everything looks... pretty normal to me. The cables seem like they're plugged in tight. I don't see any damage or anything.

Agent: Okay. Have there been any storms in your area recently, or any recent work done near your house?

Customer: No storms that I know of. Uh, actually, wait... my neighbor mentioned they were doing some road work about a block away yesterday. But I don't know if that has anything to do with it.

Agent: (pause) It's possible, actually. Construction work can sometimes damage lines. But let me try a few more things before we jump to that conclusion. Can you try accessing your modem's settings page? It's usually 192.168.0.1 in your web browser.

Customer: Uh, I can't do that right now because I don't have internet. That's kind of the problem here. (slight frustration in voice)

Agent: (pause) Right, sorry about that—I should've thought that through. Okay, um... let me try a different approach. You mentioned your phone won't connect either. Is that to the WiFi, or did you mean mobile data?

Customer: WiFi. I tried connecting to my WiFi network and it's just not... the connection drops immediately. Won't even let me stay connected long enough to load anything.

Agent: That's... (pause) Actually, that's interesting, because that suggests the router might be getting a signal. Let me ask you something—when you look at the modem now, after the restart, how many of those lights are on?

Customer: (pause) Let me look again. There's the green power light. Then I see... (counting quietly) ...it looks like three lights total are lit up. One green, two red.

Agent: Okay, so the online light is still red, and... can you tell me if any of the other lights are blinking at all? Or are they all solid?

Customer: (pause) One of the red lights looks like it might be blinking. It's hard to tell.

Agent: That blinking red light—is that on the Online light, or is it one of the others?

Customer: It's... it's hard to tell exactly which one. They're close together. Let me try to get a better look. (pause) I think it might be a different light that's blinking. Not the Online one.

Agent: Okay, well, that blinking light usually indicates activity or an error condition. (pause) I think at this point, we might be dealing with a line issue rather than an equipment issue. The restarts haven't resolved it, and the lights suggest the modem isn't establishing a connection to our network.

Customer: So what does that mean? How do we fix it?

Agent: Well, ideally we'd want to send a technician out to check the line coming into your house and test the connection from our end. Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest we could get someone out would be... (pause) ...tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we have an opening three days from now in the morning.

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't you do anything today? I really need my internet back on.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize. Unfortunately, that's all the availability we have in your area today. Our technicians are pretty booked up. But I can put you down for that tomorrow afternoon slot if that works for you?

Customer: (frustrated) Yeah, I guess tomorrow is better than waiting three days. But this is really frustrating. I have work I need to do.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry we weren't able to resolve this over the phone. Before we book that appointment, let me just try one more thing. Can you unplug your modem and leave it unplugged for a full two minutes this time?

Customer: Two minutes? Okay, (pause) unplugging now. (pause) Alright, it's been about... I'm watching the clock... almost thirty seconds in. (pause) Still waiting. (pause) About a minute now. (pause) Alright, two minutes are up. Plugging it back in. (sounds of plugging in) Okay, back on.

Agent: Just let it fully boot up again. This sometimes helps reset the connection from our network side.

Customer: (pause) Okay, lights are coming back on. Green power light's on. (pause) I'm seeing... (pause) ...it looks like the same pattern as before. Still have the red lights.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, unfortunately that didn't do it either. I think at this point we definitely need to get a technician out there. Can I go ahead and schedule that appointment for tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM?

Customer: (sigh) Yes, go ahead.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I've got you scheduled. Your confirmation number is FRN-8847-2024. A technician will come out tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. You should get a call about an hour before they arrive. In the meantime, if you see any change in those lights or if your internet suddenly comes back on, just give us a call and we can cancel the appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's... no. I guess I'll just see what happens tomorrow. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I really am sorry we couldn't get it working today. We'll get this sorted out tomorrow. Thank you for calling Frontier, and I apologize again for the inconvenience.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Goodbye.

Agent: Goodbye.
