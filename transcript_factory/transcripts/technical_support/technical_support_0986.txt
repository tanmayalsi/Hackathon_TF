# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got some important stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's David. David Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got you here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning. Did anything change recently? Like, did you have any storms in your area or any power outages?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine last night. I went to bed, woke up this morning and... nothing. The modem's completely dark.

Agent: Okay, the modem is completely dark. So there's no lights on it at all?

Customer: Right. No lights. Nothing.

Agent: Alright, let's start with the basics then. Can you check if the power cable is securely plugged into the modem? Sometimes these things can come loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me... yeah, it's plugged in. I can see it's connected to the outlet too.

Agent: Good. And the outlet itself - is it working? Do you have anything else plugged into that outlet that you know is working?

Customer: Hmm, let me... (background noise) I've got a lamp right there. Let me plug it in. (pause) Yeah, the lamp works. So the outlet's fine.

Agent: Great, that's helpful. So we know power is getting to the outlet. Now, can you try unplugging the modem for about thirty seconds? Just pull it out completely.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) It's out.

Agent: Perfect. While we're waiting, let me just confirm - you're using the modem we provided, correct? The Frontier-issued one?

Customer: Yeah, it's the white box thing. I think it says Frontier on it.

Agent: That's the one. Alright, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in... okay, it's in. (pause) Hmm, still nothing. No lights coming on.

Agent: Okay, it's still not lighting up. (pause) Can you... is the power button on the modem itself? Sometimes there's a small button on the device. Do you see anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Oh, wait. Yeah, there's like a little button on the back. Let me... (pause) Oh! Okay, the lights are coming on now. I pressed the button.

Agent: Excellent! (laughs slightly) That's good. Okay, so now we should see some lights. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing? Are they steady or blinking?

Customer: Um, there's like three lights and they're... they're blinking. Kind of like amber or yellow colored. They're blinking pretty fast.

Agent: Okay, blinking yellow lights. That usually means the modem is still initializing or there might be a connection issue. Give it about a minute or two to fully boot up and see if any of those lights turn green or blue.

Customer: (pause) Okay, waiting... (longer pause) Still blinking. Still yellow.

Agent: Still yellow? Okay, um... let me try something else. Can you check the cables in the back of the modem? There should be a cable coming from the wall - usually a coaxial cable. Can you see if that's firmly connected?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. Let me... (sound of fumbling) ...yeah, it's connected pretty good. I don't think... wait, actually, let me see if I can tighten it. (pause) Yeah, I'm tightening it now. (pause) Okay, it's snug.

Agent: Good. Let's give it another minute to see if that helps.

Customer: (long pause) No, still the same. Still blinking yellow.

Agent: Alright. And you don't see any red lights on there at all, right? Just the yellow?

Customer: Just yellow.

Agent: (pause) Okay, David, I'm going to do something on my end. Let me send a reset command to your modem. This might take a moment. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm sending that now. Your modem might restart - you might see the lights go off briefly.

Customer: (pause) Okay... oh, they went off. Waiting...

Agent: Yeah, that's normal. Just... just give it a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay, they're coming back on. Yellow again.

Agent: Still yellow. (pause, typing sounds) Alright, let me check what we're seeing on our end here... (pause) Hmm, that's strange. It looks like there might be an issue with the line itself. It's showing as inactive from our servers.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it on your end or my end?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be a line issue between your house and our network hub, or it could be a provisioning issue. Uh, let me try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem again and wait about a minute this time?

Customer: (sighing) Okay... (pause) Unplugging it again. (long pause) Okay, a minute should be up. Plugging it back in... finding the button... (pause) Pressing the button. Lights are on again. Still yellow.

Agent: Still yellow?

Customer: Yeah, still yellow.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm... I'm going to be honest with you, David. I'm not seeing the connection come back online on our end. Usually by now, after these steps, we'd see it activate. I think there might be an issue with your service line that requires a technician to come out and take a look.

Customer: A technician? So you're saying you can't fix this over the phone?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. Not with what I'm seeing. This appears to be something physical with the line connection or possibly an issue at our network hub. I'd really need to get one of our field technicians out to your location to diagnose it properly.

Customer: When could they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. What's your address for the service?

Customer: 447 Maple Street, Apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing) Okay, and do you have a preferred day or timeframe?

Customer: I mean, the sooner the better. Can they come tomorrow?

Agent: Let me see... (pause) I do have a window tomorrow between 9 AM and 1 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that works. That's fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you, and I'll note in the account that you've already done some troubleshooting steps. The technician will be fully prepared when they arrive. They should be able to assess the issue and get you back online.

Customer: Okay. So they'll just... they'll fix it?

Agent: They should be able to diagnose the issue and repair it, yes. If for some reason it's something more complex, they'll let you know. But in most cases like this, they can resolve it on-site.

Customer: Alright. What's the appointment number or... how will I know when they're coming?

Agent: You'll receive a confirmation text and email with all the details, including a tech name and their contact information. They typically call about 30 minutes before they arrive. Is the phone number we have on file still the best number to reach you?

Customer: Uh, what number do you have?

Agent: (typing) It shows 555-0147.

Customer: Yeah, that's... actually, that's the home phone. My cell is 555-8493.

Agent: Let me update that. (typing) Okay, I've added your cell number as the primary contact for the technician. They'll give you a call on that number tomorrow.

Customer: Great. Anything else I need to do?

Agent: No, just make sure someone's home during that window. You don't need to do anything else with the modem - let the technician handle it. They'll have tools and equipment we can't access remotely.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. Thanks for trying.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone, David. I know that's frustrating. But we'll definitely get you taken care of tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. I appreciate your patience, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. You should expect your technician between 9 and 1 tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Take care, David.
