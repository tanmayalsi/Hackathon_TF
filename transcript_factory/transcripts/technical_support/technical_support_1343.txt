Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out about twenty minutes ago and I can't get it back online. I've already tried unplugging my router and... yeah, nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick so I can take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the phone number tied to it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And can I get your name for verification?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Thank you, David. Alright, I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) So you're in Portland, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And you mentioned your internet went out about twenty minutes ago?

Customer: Yeah, roughly twenty minutes. One minute it was working fine and then just... nothing. No lights, no connection, nothing.

Agent: Okay. So when you say no lights, are you talking about the lights on your modem or your router?

Customer: Both, actually. Like, the whole thing just seems like it's dead. There's no power going to any of it.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful. Let me ask you a couple quick questions. First, have you checked the power cable? Is it still plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Well, yeah, I mean... I think so? Let me just... (sounds of movement) Yeah, no, it's plugged into the wall. It's definitely in there.

Agent: Good. And is the outlet itself working? Like, do you have anything else plugged into that same outlet that's still on?

Customer: Um, I have a lamp next to it. Let me check. (pause) Yeah, the lamp is on, so the outlet's fine.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so we know the outlet has power. Let me have you try something. Can you unplug the modem and the router for about thirty seconds, and then plug them back in? Start with the modem first.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Alright, waiting... (pause) That should be thirty seconds. Plugging back in. (typing sounds in background) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Good. Now go ahead and plug the router back in as well.

Customer: Done. (pause) Okay, so now we're waiting for it to boot back up, right?

Agent: Exactly. It usually takes a couple minutes for everything to initialize. While we wait, let me ask—did anything happen before this went out? Like, did you lose power to your house at all, or...?

Customer: No, actually. The power's been on the whole time. That's the weird part. Like, I didn't think anything was wrong until I went to check my email and nothing loaded.

Agent: Hmm, okay. (pause) Do you see any lights coming on yet?

Customer: (pause) Um... no. No, actually. It's still dark. That's... that's not normal, right?

Agent: Well, typically we'd see at least a power light within the first minute. Let me have you try unplugging it one more time and checking something for me. Can you look at the cable going from the wall outlet to the modem? Is it damaged at all? Any kinks, or...?

Customer: (sounds of movement) (pause) No, it looks fine. It's a normal cable. Wait, actually... (pause) Oh, huh.

Agent: What is it?

Customer: I'm just noticing the cable connection on the back of the modem looks a little loose. Should I... should I tighten that?

Agent: Yes, definitely. Go ahead and try tightening that connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm... trying to get a good grip on it. (pause) Alright, it's tighter now. Let me plug it back in.

Agent: Sure, go ahead.

Customer: (pause) Plugging in now. (pause) Okay, still nothing. No lights at all. This is... I mean, this is really not good. I've got work stuff I need to do on this.

Agent: I understand, David. Let me... let me just pull up some information here on your account. (typing sounds) (pause) Actually, are you experiencing any outages in your area? Let me check that. (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end for your area.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could mean a few different things. It could be an issue with the modem itself, or there could be an issue with the connection coming into your home. But let me have you try one more thing before we go further.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: Can you try a different outlet? Maybe one in a different room? I just want to rule out that it's not an outlet issue.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Give me a second. (sounds of movement) (longer pause) Alright, I've got it plugged into an outlet in the kitchen now.

Agent: Great. Do you see any lights?

Customer: (pause) No. Still nothing. I'm... I'm pretty sure something's wrong with the modem.

Agent: (pause) I'm leaning that direction too, to be honest. Okay, listen, what I think we need to do here is schedule a technician visit. There could be an issue with the line coming into your home, or the modem could be defective. Either way, we're gonna need someone out there to take a look.

Customer: How long would that take? Like, when could someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) So the earliest I'm seeing is tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... that's really the earliest?

Agent: I'm afraid so. We're pretty booked up today. Is tomorrow in that window going to work?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean, I'll have to make it work. It's not ideal, but... yeah.

Agent: Alright, let me get that scheduled for you. Can you confirm the address where the technician should come?

Customer: It's 4427 Elm Street, Portland, 97214.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. So we have you down for tomorrow, December 14th, between 12 and 4 PM at 4427 Elm Street. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with, or do you have any questions about the appointment?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. I just really hope they can fix this quickly.

Agent: I completely understand. Just as a reminder, you should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes. If you need to reschedule for any reason, you can call back or check your email for the appointment details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, David. We apologize for the inconvenience, and we look forward to getting your internet back up and running tomorrow. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
