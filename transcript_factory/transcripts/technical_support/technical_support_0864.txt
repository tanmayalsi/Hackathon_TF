Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went out completely. Like, I can't get online at all, and I need to figure out this out pretty quickly because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that must be, especially when you're working. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. And your name is... James Martinez?

Customer: That's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely. I tried unplugging the modem, waiting like five minutes, plugging it back in, but nothing. No lights, no nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's actually a good first step that you already tried. Let me ask you a few questions. When you say there are no lights on the modem, can you tell me what color the lights typically are when everything's working properly?

Customer: Um, usually they're blue and green, I think? Blue on the left side, green on the right?

Agent: Okay, and right now there's nothing at all?

Customer: Nope, it's completely dark.

Agent: Alright. Let me just check your connection status on my end here. (pause) (typing sounds) Hmm, so I am showing that your modem is currently offline. Let me check if there's been any outages in your area. (pause) What area are you in, by the way?

Customer: I'm in the downtown area, near... uh, near the intersection of Maple and Fifth.

Agent: Okay, let me pull that up. (typing sounds) No, I'm not seeing any reported outages in that area. So, the good news is it's probably not a widespread issue. Let me walk you through a few more troubleshooting steps. Can you check the back of your modem and make sure the power cable is fully plugged in?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... it looks plugged in, but let me... (sounds of movement) Yeah, it's definitely in there.

Agent: Okay, and the cable that runs from the modem to the wall outlet—the coaxial cable—can you check that that's secure as well?

Customer: The... the thick cable thing?

Agent: Yes, exactly.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, it looks fine to me. Both ends seem pretty tight.

Agent: Good. Now, what I'm going to have you do is unplug the modem again, but this time wait about two minutes before plugging it back in. And while we wait, I'm going to check a few things on my end.

Customer: Alright, I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, you don't have any other Frontier equipment, like a separate router or anything?

Customer: No, just the modem. That's it.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, go ahead and wait... (pause) ...and while you're waiting, can you tell me if you've had any recent weather or power issues in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Power's been fine. Actually, everything was working great this morning. I was on a video call like forty-five minutes ago, and it was all good.

Agent: Okay, so this just happened very recently then.

Customer: Yeah, like literally in the last half hour or so.

Agent: (pause) Alright, it's been about two minutes. Go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, plugging it in now. (pause) ...okay, it's in. (pause) Hmm, still nothing. Still completely dark.

Agent: Still no lights at all?

Customer: Nope. Nothing.

Agent: Alright, let me try something else. I'm going to power cycle your connection from my end here. This should restart your connection to our network. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, go ahead and give that a moment...

Customer: (pause) ...still nothing. It's still dark.

Agent: Okay. Um, [inaudible] one moment. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm showing that we're still not seeing your modem connect to our network. That typically points to either a hardware issue with the modem itself, or... it could be an issue with the connection line coming into your home. Have you noticed any loose cables or anything unusual near the exterior of your house?

Customer: I mean, I haven't really looked outside. Do you want me to go check?

Agent: Yeah, if you could, that would be really helpful. Just look around the outside of your house for any loose cables or any boxes that might be damaged.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm heading outside now. (background noise, sounds of door opening) Okay, I'm out here. (pause) I see... there's the box right here. Uh, looks normal to me. I don't see anything damaged or loose or anything.

Agent: Okay, good. And the cable running from that box into your house looks secure?

Customer: Yeah, looks fine to me.

Agent: Alright. (typing sounds) (pause) James, I'm going to be honest with you—based on what we're seeing here, it seems like there might be an issue with the modem hardware itself, or possibly a line issue that we can't quite pinpoint from here. I think what we need to do is get a technician out to your place to take a look at this in person.

Customer: Oh... okay. How long would that take? I really need to get back online today.

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) (pause) So, I can get someone out to you today if you're available. We have an opening between 2 and 5 PM this afternoon. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I can do that. That should be fine.

Agent: Excellent. Let me just get a few details. Your address is 847 Maple Street, downtown, correct?

Customer: That's right.

Agent: And a phone number where the technician can reach you?

Customer: 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you scheduled for today between 2 and 5 PM. The technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive to confirm. Is there anything else I can help you with while I have you?

Customer: No, I think that's... I mean, I hope this gets fixed today.

Agent: I understand. I really do apologize for the inconvenience. The technician will get to the bottom of this for you.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you this afternoon.

Customer: Okay, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
