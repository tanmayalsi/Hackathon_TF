Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just completely went out about an hour ago. One minute it was working fine, and now I've got nothing. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your phone number or account number?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I'm showing an account for a residence on Maple Street, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And I'm seeing you have our Fiber 500 package. Let me ask you a few quick questions so we can figure out what's going on. First, when you say your internet is out, are any of the lights on your modem showing anything? Like, is it powered on?

Customer: Um, let me look... Yeah, okay, so the power light is on, it's like, white or something. But the internet light... I think it's red? Yeah, definitely red.

Agent: Okay, red is not good. That typically means there's no connection to our network. Let me walk you through a few troubleshooting steps. First, can you unplug the modem from the power outlet, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in?

Customer: Right now?

Agent: Yeah, if you could do that real quick. I'll wait on the line.

Customer: (background noise of movement) Okay, unplugging it... (pause) It's powered down... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) It's... it's powering back up. The lights are... okay, the white light is back on. But the red light on the internet is still there.

Agent: Okay, the red light is still showing. Um, let me ask you this—do you have a modem and a router, or do you have a combined unit?

Customer: I think it's combined? It's just one box. It says Frontier on it.

Agent: Perfect, that's what I figured. Okay, can you also check the cables? Is the cable that goes into the modem—the one that comes from the wall—is it plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks pretty tight to me. I mean, I'm not gonna rip it out, but it seems connected.

Agent: Right, no, don't force it. Okay, um, let me try a different approach. I'm going to restart your modem remotely from here. This should take just a moment. (typing sounds) Okay, I've sent the command. This will take about two to three minutes for the modem to fully reboot. Why don't you just wait a second and see if those lights change?

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm watching it... The white light is still on... and um... (pause) Is it supposed to be blinking or solid?

Agent: When it's rebooting, you should see some blinking. It might take a minute or so. Why don't you give it another 30 seconds?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see some blinking now. Okay, we're getting somewhere. (pause) Oh wait, now the lights are... the white is solid again, but the internet light is still red. That didn't help.

Agent: Hmm, that's frustrating. Okay, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) So I'm not seeing any service issues in your area, and your account is all active. The fact that the internet light is still red after a remote reboot tells me there might be a signal issue coming into your home. Have you noticed anything unusual? Like any recent storms, or maybe someone bumped the cable outside?

Customer: No, I don't think so. It was fine this morning. I went to get coffee, came back, and it was just... gone.

Agent: I understand. Let me ask you—do you have any other devices you can test with? Like a computer or a phone? Can you try to connect to the WiFi manually and see what happens?

Customer: Sure, let me grab my phone. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at available networks and... I don't even see the Frontier network showing up. Usually it's always there.

Agent: Okay, so the network isn't broadcasting. That does point to the modem not syncing with our network. Let me try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset of the modem?

Customer: A factory reset? Will I have to redo all my settings and stuff?

Agent: You shouldn't have to—the settings should come back once it connects. But I'll be honest, if this works, you might need to reconnect any devices you had paired. It should reprovision pretty quickly though.

Customer: Alright, how do I do that?

Agent: There should be a small button, might be recessed, on the back of the modem. You'll want to hold it down for about 10 to 15 seconds until you see the lights go out or start flashing.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found a button... I'm pressing it... and holding it... (pause) The lights are... yeah, they're all off now. How long does this take?

Agent: It should take a few minutes. We're looking at maybe three to five. Go ahead and let it sit for a moment, and then we should start seeing the lights come back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) The white power light is back on... (longer pause) And it's been a couple minutes now, but that internet light is... it's still red. This is not working.

Agent: Yeah, I'm seeing that you're still not registering on our network. At this point, I've walked through all the standard troubleshooting, and unfortunately, it seems like there might be a physical issue either with the modem itself or potentially with the line coming into your house. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is my modem broken?

Agent: It's hard to say for certain without checking the equipment physically, but the red light after a factory reset is usually a pretty strong indicator of a hardware failure on the modem side, or possibly a line issue. What I'd like to do is schedule a technician to come out and take a look. They can check the external connection, possibly test the line, and if needed, swap out the modem.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds) I can get someone out to you tomorrow afternoon, between 2 and 5 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's not ideal, but I guess I don't have much choice. Yeah, okay.

Agent: (typing) Perfect. I've got a technician scheduled for tomorrow, April 18th, between 2 and 5 PM. They'll have a modem with them in case we need to swap it out. You should get a confirmation text within the next few minutes. Is the number ending in... (pause) ...6473 still the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell. That's fine.

Agent: Great. I do want to apologize for not being able to get this resolved over the phone. Unfortunately, when it gets to this point, we do need someone out there physically.

Customer: I appreciate you trying. It's just frustrating because I've got deadlines and everything.

Agent: I totally get it. The good news is these things usually turn around pretty quickly once the tech gets there. And if it does end up being a modem issue, they can have you back up and running pretty much right away.

Customer: Okay, well, I guess I'll see them tomorrow then.

Agent: Sounds good. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, sorry we couldn't fix it remotely. You should be all set for tomorrow. Thanks for calling Frontier, and have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
