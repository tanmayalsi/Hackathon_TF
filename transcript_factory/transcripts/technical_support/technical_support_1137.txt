Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, uh, my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back up. I've been without service since like 8 AM.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I'm showing your service address is 412 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, you're a Fiber internet customer with us, correct?

Customer: Yes, I've got the gigabit plan.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so your internet is completely down right now. Are you able to see any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, there's some lights. The modem has like a blue light, but the router... I think the router light is red or something. It's not the normal green.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the blue light on the modem—is it steady or is it blinking?

Customer: It's blinking. Like, pretty slowly.

Agent: Alright, a slow blinking blue light typically means the modem is trying to connect. And you said the router light is red? Let me ask you this—are both devices plugged in? Sometimes we see issues if the power cables got disconnected somehow.

Customer: Yeah, they're both plugged in. I checked that already. I'm not an idiot or anything, but... (laugh) you know, I wanted to make sure before I called.

Agent: (laugh) No, I appreciate that actually. A lot of times it is something simple like that, so it's good you checked. Okay, so let's try a power cycle. Can you unplug the modem first? Just pull the power cable out of the back.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Done.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about 30 seconds while that powers down completely. I'm gonna stay on the line with you.

Customer: (pause) Thirty seconds seems like forever, man.

Agent: (laugh) I know, I know. We're almost there. Go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Good. Now watch those lights. What are you seeing?

Customer: Uh... (pause) Okay, so the blue light was off for a second, now it's blinking again. It's a little faster now than before, I think.

Agent: That's a good sign. That means it's rebooting. Let's give it about two minutes to fully come back online. While we wait, let me ask—have you experienced any issues like this before, or is this the first time?

Customer: First time since I've had Frontier. I've been a customer for, I dunno, about two years now? And service has been solid up until today.

Agent: Good to know. And is there any weather in your area right now? Any storms or anything that might have affected the connection?

Customer: No, it's been clear all morning. It was fine when I went to bed last night, and when I woke up, just nothing.

Agent: Okay. Alright, check those lights again for me. What do you have now?

Customer: (pause) Umm, the modem light is still blinking blue. It hasn't changed.

Agent: Still blinking slowly?

Customer: Yeah, pretty slow. I mean, it's been like two minutes now, right?

Agent: It has, yeah. Let me try something else. Are you comfortable unplugging the router as well?

Customer: The WiFi one?

Agent: Yes, that's right. The router.

Customer: Sure, okay, unplugging it. (pause) Got it.

Agent: Perfect. Let that sit for 30 seconds too.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) It's back.

Agent: Alright. Now let's see if you can try connecting to the internet on your phone or a computer. Do you have a device nearby?

Customer: I've got my laptop right here. Let me... (pause) Okay, pulling up my WiFi networks. (longer pause) I'm not seeing my network at all. Nothing. No Frontier_[inaudible], nothing.

Agent: Hmm. It's not broadcasting. That's... okay. Let me try a different approach. I'm going to have you do what's called a hard reset on the modem. This will clear everything out and reboot it fresh. Fair warning, you'll need to set up your WiFi password again after, but that's no big deal.

Customer: How do I do that?

Agent: On the back of the modem, there should be a small button labeled "Reset." It's usually recessed in a little hole so you need something pointy to press it. Do you have a paperclip or something like that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I can find one. Hold on. (longer pause) Okay, I'm looking at the back. I see it. It's got like a little reset hole.

Agent: That's the one. What I need you to do is hold that button down for about 10 seconds. You'll see the lights go out completely, and then they'll come back on. Ready?

Customer: Yeah, ready. (pause) Okay, I'm pressing it. (pause) The lights just went out. (pause) Okay, they're coming back on now.

Agent: Perfect. Give it about three to four minutes to fully restart this time. It'll take a little longer than before since we did a full reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'll wait.

Agent: (pause) While we wait, I do want to mention that after this reboot, you'll need to go through the WiFi setup. You should see a setup screen or a default network that pops up.

Customer: Alright. (longer pause) So... how much longer?

Agent: Let's check. What are you seeing on the modem now?

Customer: (pause) The blue light is still blinking, same as before. Maybe a little faster? It's hard to tell.

Agent: Okay, let's give it another minute or so. (pause) Alright, try the lights again.

Customer: (pause) Still blinking blue. (pause) This is weird, right? Like, shouldn't it have come back by now?

Agent: That is unusual, yeah. Let me ask you something—when you look at the back of the modem, do you see a cable that goes into the wall? Like a fiber optic cable? It's usually thinner and has a little clip on each end.

Customer: Uh... (pause) Yeah, I see something that looks like that. It's got like a little blue clip on it.

Agent: Okay, can you double-check that it's firmly seated in the modem? Sometimes they can get slightly loose.

Customer: (pause) Let me look closer. (pause) It looks pretty tight to me, but let me try wiggling it a little. (pause) Hmm, nope, it's not budging.

Agent: Alright. (pause) I'm going to be honest with you—the fact that the modem is stuck on that blinking blue light after a full reset is... it's not normal. Usually, we see that when there's a connection issue between the modem and our network on this end.

Customer: Wait, so like... is it broken?

Agent: Not necessarily. It could be a few things. The fiber line itself could be an issue, or there could be something on our end that needs to be checked. Unfortunately, with the modem not fully initializing, I'm limited in what I can troubleshoot from here.

Customer: Okay, so what does that mean? Like, what happens now?

Agent: (pause) I think what we need to do is get a technician out to your location. They can test the fiber line directly and check everything physically. Let me see... (typing sounds) I can actually get someone out there as early as tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? I mean... I really need this fixed today if possible. I work from home and I'm already losing time.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check if there's any availability today. (pause) (typing sounds) Unfortunately, all our technician slots for today are booked. The next available would be tomorrow morning. I'm sorry about that.

Customer: (frustrated) That's not ideal, but I guess I don't have a choice, do I?

Agent: I know it's frustrating. If anything changes or if you want to try one more thing before the technician comes, you can always call back. But based on what we're seeing, I think there's something physical that needs to be checked.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Go ahead and schedule the technician. What time should I expect them?

Agent: It'll be between 8 AM and noon tomorrow. Can I get a callback number to confirm the appointment?

Customer: It's the same number on the account.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, sir, you're all set. Your technician appointment is confirmed for tomorrow, 8 AM to noon. If the technician needs to reschedule, they'll reach out to you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved today. Hopefully the technician will get everything squared away tomorrow. If you have any other questions before then, feel free to give us a call back. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Yeah, no problem. Bye.

Agent: You take care. Bye now.
