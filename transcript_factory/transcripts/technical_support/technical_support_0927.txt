# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I can't figure out what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got your account here. So your internet service is completely down right now, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, completely. I mean, the modem's still got lights on it, but nothing's actually working. I can't load any websites or anything.

Agent: Okay, I understand. That's frustrating. Let's run through a few quick troubleshooting steps. First, can you tell me—are all the lights on your modem the same as usual, or do you notice anything different?

Customer: Um... (pause) let me look at it. There's a power light that's on... there's like a green one that's solid... and then there's... I think it says "Online" but it's not lit up. Is that bad?

Agent: That's actually really helpful information. The fact that the "Online" light isn't lit tells me the modem isn't connecting to our network properly. Have you tried restarting the modem yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. How do I do that?

Agent: It's pretty simple. Just unplug the power cable from the back of the modem, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. While you're doing that, I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: Okay, give me a second... (unplugging sounds) Yeah, it's unplugged. I'm gonna count to thirty... (pause) ...and... (plugging sounds) okay, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about a minute to boot back up. While we wait, David, have you experienced any service issues recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. It's been working fine until this morning. I woke up and tried to check my email and just... nothing.

Agent: Understood. Okay, so the modem should be booting up now. Are you seeing that "Online" light come back on?

Customer: (pause) Um... no. I mean, the green light is on, but that "Online" light... (pause) ...nope, still nothing.

Agent: Alright, let's try one more thing. Can you check if there's a cable running from your modem into your router, or do you have those combined into one unit?

Customer: I... I'm not really sure. I have like a box, a black box. Is that the modem?

Agent: That's probably it. Is there a cable going into it from the wall, like a thick gray or black cable?

Customer: Yeah, there's definitely a cable coming from the wall.

Agent: Okay, good. And is there any other cable running out of that box to like a separate device?

Customer: No, I don't think so. Just the power cable.

Agent: Perfect. Let me check something on my end real quick. (typing sounds, pause) David, can you tell me—are you seeing any flashing lights on the modem right now?

Customer: Yeah, actually. There's like a yellow light that keeps blinking. That wasn't blinking before, was it?

Agent: That's actually a good sign. That usually means it's trying to connect. Let's wait another minute and see if it stabilizes... (pause) Still blinking?

Customer: Yeah, it's still blinking. How long should I wait?

Agent: Typically it shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Let me check something on the account here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area. That's good news. Have you had any recent storms or power issues?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine all week.

Agent: Okay... David, I'm going to have you try one more troubleshooting step. This time, I need you to do a factory reset on the modem. There should be a small reset button, probably on the back. You'll need to hold it down for about ten to fifteen seconds while the modem is powered on.

Customer: Um... okay, let me find that. (pause) I think I see it. It's really small, right?

Agent: That's the one. Go ahead and grab something like a paperclip so you can press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I got a paperclip. Holding it down now... ten, eleven, twelve... (pause) ...fifteen. Releasing it now.

Agent: Perfect. Now the modem's going to restart completely. This might take a couple minutes. What we're doing is clearing the configuration and starting fresh, which sometimes resolves connection issues.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so how long until I know if it worked?

Agent: Give it about three to four minutes to fully boot back up. (pause) While we're waiting, have you noticed any burning smells or anything unusual coming from the modem or the cables?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It just seems... dead, almost.

Agent: I understand. Let me review your account history here... (typing sounds) I'm seeing that you're on our Fiber 200 plan. Have you had any recent changes to your account or equipment?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of. I've had this for like two years now.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Alright, has the modem powered back on yet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the lights are back on. The green one is solid again, but the "Online" light is... still not on.

Agent: Hmm. Still not connecting. That's... (pause) Let me think about this for a second. David, I want to try one more thing before we potentially need to escalate this. Can you check all the cables connected to your modem? We want to make sure everything is plugged in snugly.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me check. There's the power cable... feels pretty secure. And there's the... wait, actually... (pause) ...oh, there's another cable I didn't notice before. It's behind some other stuff.

Agent: Ah, okay. Can you trace that cable and see where it goes?

Customer: It's... it looks like it goes to the wall. Into a little outlet type thing. Is that important?

Agent: That's your connection line from our network. Try unplugging that one for about ten seconds and then plugging it back in, but be gentle with it.

Customer: (unplugging sounds) Okay, ten seconds... (pause) ...and back in. (plugging sounds)

Agent: Great. Now let's wait and see if that "Online" light comes on.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, so... it's been like thirty seconds. Still nothing.

Agent: Still no "Online" light?

Customer: No, it's just that green light and the yellow blinking light again.

Agent: (pause, longer than before) Alright, David, I want to be honest with you. We've gone through several standard troubleshooting steps and the modem still isn't connecting to our network. This usually indicates either an issue with the physical connection from our side, or it could be a problem with the modem hardware itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you guys fix it?

Agent: Well, we have a couple of options. The first would be to send out a technician to your home to check the line and potentially replace the modem. That would usually be within the next two to three business days depending on availability.

Customer: Two or three days? I need internet before then. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) The earliest appointment I'm seeing is actually tomorrow afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Uh... yeah, that could work. But I really can't wait longer than that.

Agent: I completely get it, and I've noted your account as high priority. Let me get you scheduled for that tomorrow afternoon appointment. Can you confirm your address is 4521 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And you'll be available tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM?

Customer: Yeah, I'll make sure I'm there.

Agent: Great. I'm going to get you a ticket number for this visit. Your ticket number is 7839451. A technician will come by tomorrow and they'll assess the line and determine if it's a service issue or equipment failure. In the meantime, I'm going to add a courtesy credit to your account for the days you're without service.

Customer: Okay, thank you. Is there anything else I should try before they get here?

Agent: Honestly, at this point I wouldn't recommend trying anything else. Just leave the modem as is and let the technician take a look at it tomorrow. If something miraculously starts working before then, great, but if not, they'll get you up and running.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate the help, Marcus.

Agent: No problem at all, David. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Okay, so just to recap: you have a technician visit scheduled for tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, your ticket number is 7839451, and we've added a service credit to your account. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all those details.

Customer: Great, thanks.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer, David, and thanks for your patience today. Hopefully we'll get this resolved tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
