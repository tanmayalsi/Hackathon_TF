Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of to fix it myself, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. So you're experiencing a complete outage with no internet connection at all?

Customer: Right, yeah. The modem's got the lights on and everything, but when I try to connect, nothing happens. I can't get online at all.

Agent: Alright, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your modem right now? Are they blinking or solid?

Customer: Um... (pause) there's a green light that's solid, and then there's like a blue light that's blinking. And I think there's an orange one that's... actually, I'm not sure. It's kind of hard to see from where I'm sitting.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. The solid green light is good—that means there's power. The blinking blue light usually indicates it's trying to connect or is in the process of syncing. Have you tried unplugging the modem and waiting about thirty seconds before plugging it back in?

Customer: Yeah, I did that actually. I unplugged it for like a minute this morning. That didn't help.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Let's try that one more time together. Can you unplug it now and count to thirty for me?

Customer: Sure, yeah. (background noise of movement) Okay, unplugging now. One... two... three... (pause) ...twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. Going back in. (plugging sound)

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about two minutes to fully boot up and reconnect. While that's happening, can you tell me—when did this start exactly? Was it working fine last night?

Customer: Yeah, it was working fine yesterday. I was using it in the evening, no problems. Then this morning I got up, tried to check my email, and just... nothing. Won't load anything.

Agent: Okay, and you haven't had any storms or power outages in your area that you're aware of?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been clear all morning.

Agent: (typing) Alright. Do you have a computer or phone you can try connecting to right now? Just to test if it's the WiFi or if it's the modem itself?

Customer: I'm actually on my phone right now, trying to use the hotspot from my wife's phone to talk to you. So I've got a laptop over here. (pause) Let me try connecting to the WiFi... (pause) Yeah, it's not picking it up. Well, it is picking it up now. I'm seeing the network name.

Agent: Good, go ahead and try connecting to it.

Customer: Okay, typing in the password... (pause) It says it's connecting... and... (longer pause) ...nope. It's just saying "cannot connect to network."

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check the modem status on my end real quick. (typing sounds, pause) I'm not showing a connection coming from your modem to our network. That's unusual. Let me ask—do you have a router, or is your WiFi coming directly from the modem?

Customer: I have a separate router. It's like a white box, uh... I think it's a Netgear or something?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Can you check if that router is powered on as well? Sometimes they have a power button or switch on the back.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it back here... (pause) It's on. I can see the lights on it too. There's like a green light and—wait, actually, let me check. (pause) Oh! I don't think it's powered on. Let me... (pause) Let me plug it in.

Agent: Okay, go ahead.

Customer: (plugging sound) Alright, it's on now. Lights are coming up. (pause) Okay, now there's more lights. Should I try the WiFi again?

Agent: Yeah, let's give it about thirty seconds to fully boot up, and then go ahead and try.

Customer: (pause) Okay, trying now... (pause) Nope. Still nothing. Still says cannot connect.

Agent: Alright, let's try something else. Can you try connecting to the network with the ethernet cable instead? Just plug a cable directly from your modem to your computer.

Customer: An ethernet cable? Um... I don't think I have one of those.

Agent: You don't have one available?

Customer: No, I don't think so. I mean, I could look around, but... (pause) I'm pretty sure we don't.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Let me check a few other things on my end. (typing, pause) I'm still not seeing your modem connecting to our network at all. Do you know when was the last time you updated your bill or if there's anything pending with your account?

Customer: No, I pay it on time every month. There shouldn't be anything wrong with the account.

Agent: (pause) I'm not showing anything flagged on the billing side either, so that's not it. Let me run a line test to see if there's an issue with your fiber connection. Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (pause, background hold music faintly audible) Okay, I'm back. So the line test is showing... it's showing no active connection coming through to your location at all. That could mean a few things. It could be an issue with your line, or there could be an outage in your area that we're not aware of yet. Let me check if there are any reported outages in your zip code.

Customer: Okay, um, how long does something like that usually take to fix?

Agent: It really depends on what the issue is. If it's something on our end with the lines or equipment, once we dispatch a technician, it can be anywhere from a day or two. If it's something with your modem or router, we might be able to resolve it faster. (typing, pause) I'm not showing any active outages in your area right now, but that doesn't mean there isn't something affecting your specific line.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: [inaudible] ...I think at this point, we've done the basic troubleshooting we can do remotely. I'm going to need to schedule a technician to come out and check your line and your equipment. The issue is clearly on the connection side—your modem isn't even establishing a connection to our network.

Customer: How soon can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing, pause) We have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and 6 PM. Does that work for you, or would you prefer a specific time window?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't someone come out today?

Agent: Unfortunately, our next available slot today is pretty tight, but let me see... (pause) We could potentially get someone to you around 4 PM today, but I can't guarantee it. The morning to early afternoon is booked up. Would 4 PM work if we can get you in?

Customer: Yeah, that would be better than waiting until tomorrow. Let me do that.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing) Alright, I've got you down for a technician visit today between 4 and 6 PM. Your reference number is 447829. You should get a text and an email confirmation shortly with those details and the technician's information.

Customer: Okay, got it. And they'll be able to fix it when they get here?

Agent: They'll definitely diagnose what the issue is and do their best to resolve it on the spot. If it's something more complex, they might need to coordinate with our network team, but in most cases, technician visits solve the problem same day.

Customer: Alright, I hope so. This has been really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Is there anything else I can help you with while we wait for the technician?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just hoping they can get it fixed.

Agent: I'll note on your account that you've been without service since this morning, so the technician will see that and prioritize it. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and again, sorry for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
