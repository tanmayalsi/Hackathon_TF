Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, my internet went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and it's still not working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll get this sorted out for you. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get a name please?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Thanks for that. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you had any storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear here all day. The power's fine, everything else is working. It's just the internet.

Agent: Got it. Okay, so let me start with a few basic checks. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the router powered on?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. I can see the lights on the front, but... they're not blinking like they normally do. They're just kind of solid orange right now.

Agent: Orange lights, okay. That's actually helpful. So when you say they're solid orange, that usually means there's no connection coming into the modem. Have you tried unplugging it yet and waiting a few seconds?

Customer: I did that about ten minutes ago. I waited like, thirty seconds and plugged it back in, but nothing changed.

Agent: Alright, let's try it again, but this time let's give it a full two minutes. Go ahead and unplug the modem and the router both.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging now.

Agent: Great. While those are off, let me ask you a couple more questions. Do you happen to know if there's been any construction or work in your neighborhood recently?

Customer: Um, not that I'm aware of. I mean, there was some utility work on the street last week, but that's been done for a few days now.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. And has everything been working fine up until about an hour ago?

Customer: Yeah, totally fine. I was actually working from home all morning, streaming and everything was great. Then I just... looked at my laptop and noticed I had no connection.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in now, and then we'll wait about a minute before we plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in... okay, it's in.

Agent: Good. Let's give it about 60 seconds.

Customer: (background noise - faint keyboard clicks) (pause) Alright, I'm plugging the router back in now.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give those a couple minutes to fully boot up. While we wait, can you tell me... is it just one device that's not connecting or everything?

Customer: It's everything. My laptop won't connect, my phone won't connect. Nothing's working.

Agent: Okay, that definitely suggests it's an issue on our end rather than with one device. (pause) Alright, has it been about two minutes?

Customer: Yeah, just about.

Agent: Can you take a look at the router lights now? What color are they?

Customer: (pause) They're still orange. Maybe a little bit of blinking now, but mostly orange.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's not quite what we want to see. We want to see green. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) David, I'm showing that we did have a service outage notification in your area, but it was supposed to have been resolved about... twenty minutes ago.

Customer: Oh! So it's on Frontier's end?

Agent: It looks like it might be, yeah. But let me do a couple more things to make sure. Can you unplug the modem one more time for me? Just the modem this time.

Customer: (pause) Unplugged.

Agent: Now, while that's unplugged, can you locate the small reset button on the modem? It should be on the back or the bottom, might be recessed.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's a tiny button on the back.

Agent: Okay, while it's unplugged, go ahead and hold that reset button for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... holding it... (longer pause) It's been about ten seconds.

Agent: Great. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in... (pause) Okay, it's in.

Agent: Alright, let's give it another minute or two to boot up fresh.

Customer: (background noise) (pause) ...Still orange.

Agent: (pause) I'm not seeing any active outages right now, which is interesting. Let me pull up your modem status here. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm actually not seeing your modem registering on our network at all right now.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could mean the modem itself is having an issue, or there could be a problem with the line coming into your house. It's a bit unusual because we were just seeing it before the reset.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: (pause) Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I can schedule a technician to come out and do a full line check. They can test the signal coming into your home and make sure everything's connected properly on the outside. They'd be able to come out... let me see what we have available...

Customer: How long would that take? I need my internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately, since we've tried the standard troubleshooting and the modem isn't showing up on our network, this really does need an in-person visit. The earliest I can get someone out there would be tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't they come out today?

Agent: Let me check. (pause) (typing sounds) Unfortunately, we don't have any availability today, David. Tomorrow is the earliest opening we have. I'm sorry about that.

Customer: This is frustrating. I have meetings tomorrow morning.

Agent: I completely hear you, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Is there any chance you could reschedule some of those? Or possibly work from somewhere with internet access?

Customer: (sighs) Let me... let me think about it. But yeah, I guess I don't have much choice. Go ahead and schedule it.

Agent: Alright, I'm going to get that set up for you. So that's tomorrow, between 8 AM and noon, at your address on file which is 442 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And just to set expectations, the technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive, usually around 7:30. They'll bring all the necessary equipment to diagnose the issue.

Customer: Okay. And if it is something outside the house, Frontier covers that, right?

Agent: Yes, anything on our infrastructure side is covered. If by chance it's the modem itself and it's out of warranty, we can discuss options with you then. But let's have the tech take a look first.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: You can leave everything plugged in and powered on so the tech can see the current state when they arrive. But I wouldn't recommend doing any more resets or troubleshooting at this point. We've done what we can remotely.

Customer: Got it.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today, David?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully the tech can fix this quickly tomorrow.

Agent: I hope so too. I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. Your confirmation number is 847562, and you should receive a text and email confirmation shortly. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good night.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
