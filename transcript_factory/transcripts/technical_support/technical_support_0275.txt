Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls coming up this afternoon.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me find that for you. And just to confirm, is this the service address at 428 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. So you mentioned the internet's been down since this morning. Have you noticed if your modem or router lights are on at all?

Customer: Um, yeah, I can see the modem over there. So the power light is on, but I think... I don't think the internet light is on. It's usually blue, and I don't see that.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The blue light indicates an active connection, so that would explain why you're not getting service. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem and leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds? That'll do a hard reset for us.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, I'm unplugging it now. (rustling sounds) Thirty seconds, right?

Agent: That's right. While you're doing that, let me just ask—have there been any storms in your area recently, or any power issues?

Customer: (pause) No, not that I can think of. It's been pretty normal weather-wise. Um, we did have a power flicker maybe... I dunno, two or three days ago, but that was it.

Agent: Alright, that's good to know. Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) The lights are starting to come back on now... there's the power light, and... hmm, still no blue light though.

Agent: Okay, give it just a minute or two to fully boot up. Sometimes it takes a little time to reestablish the connection. While we wait, let me ask—do you have a separate router, or is everything combined in one unit?

Customer: No, I have a separate router. It's a different device.

Agent: Got it. Is that router powered on?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. The lights are on... I see green lights on it.

Agent: Okay, good. (pause) Alright, how's the modem looking now? Any change on that blue light?

Customer: (pause) No, still... still nothing. Just the power light. This is really weird.

Agent: I understand. Let me try something else. Can you check the cables for me? There should be a coaxial cable—it looks kind of like a TV cable—going into the modem. Can you see if it's seated properly?

Customer: Yeah, I can see it. It looks... I mean, it looks pretty tight to me. Let me try... (rustling) I'm just gonna unscrew it a little bit and screw it back in.

Agent: Good idea, yeah.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I've tightened it back up. Um... still no change on the light though.

Agent: Alright. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your account here, and I'm actually seeing that we might have a service issue in your area. Let me check the outage map. (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any active outages reported for your location, but... let me try one more thing. Can you restart the modem again? Just unplug it one more time for me.

Customer: Another hard reset?

Agent: Exactly, yeah. Just thirty seconds again.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging now. (rustling) Let me just set this phone down for a sec... (muffled sounds) Alright, thirty seconds is up. Plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, it's powered back on. Booting up again...

Agent: While that's loading, I'll be honest with you—if this doesn't work, it's likely a signal issue coming into your home, or potentially a modem issue. The fact that we're not getting that internet light to turn on even after the reset is concerning.

Customer: (pause) So what does that mean? Like, the modem's broken?

Agent: It could be, or there could be a line issue on our end. The good news is we can get a technician out to your place to diagnose the problem. (pause) How's that modem looking now?

Customer: (pause) No... nothing. Still the same. Just the power light.

Agent: Okay, yeah, I think at this point we need to get someone to physically check your line. Before I schedule that, let me just ask—are you getting any error messages on your computer or anything like that?

Customer: Um, well I can't connect to anything, so I mean... not really. When I try to connect, it just says no internet connection. That's all.

Agent: Right, yeah. (pause) Okay, so here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to get a technician scheduled for you. We have availability tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we have some slots on Thursday morning if that works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon works better than Thursday. Can you do like, morning or afternoon on Thursday as a backup in case I need it?

Agent: Of course, absolutely. So I'll go ahead and schedule you for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM, and if you need to reschedule, you can just give us a call back or check your email—you should get a confirmation with the technician's details.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that works. Is there anything else I can try in the meantime? Like, just to see if I can get it working before tomorrow?

Agent: Um, (pause) you could try power cycling the entire setup one more time—both the modem and the router—and just wait a good five minutes for everything to fully boot. But honestly, based on what we've tried, I think the technician visit is going to be necessary.

Customer: Alright, I'll give it a shot tonight if I think about it. But I'm not expecting it to magically work, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. I wish I had better news for you today. Just for your records, is there anything else I should note on your account?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Well, I apologize again for the inconvenience. Your technician visit is confirmed for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM. You should receive a confirmation email shortly. If you have any other questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out.

Customer: Okay, thanks Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll get this sorted out for you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
