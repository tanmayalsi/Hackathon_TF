Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing issues. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account here... Got it. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. And you're saying your internet is completely down?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. No lights on the modem, nothing's working. I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in but that didn't help.

Agent: Alright, that's a good first step. Let me ask you a few questions. Are you seeing any lights on the router at all right now? Even if they're not the normal color?

Customer: (pause) No, nothing. It's completely dark. And usually it's got those blue lights, you know?

Agent: Okay, understood. And the modem itself—is that the white box?—do you see any lights on that one?

Customer: Um, let me look... No, that one's dark too. Both of them are just... off I guess?

Agent: Got it. So both devices are completely dark. Can you check for me—is the power cable plugged into the modem? Sometimes it can get accidentally unplugged.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, yeah it's plugged in. I can see it going into the wall outlet.

Agent: Good. And that outlet—do you have anything else plugged into it that you know is working? Like a lamp or something?

Customer: (pause) Hold on... (sounds of something being plugged in) Yeah, I just plugged in my phone charger and it's charging, so the outlet's fine.

Agent: Perfect, so we know the outlet has power. Now, can you try unplugging the modem for about thirty seconds and then plugging it back in? Sometimes the power adapter needs to reset.

Customer: Okay, give me a second. (pause, sounds of unplugging) Alright, it's out. I'm gonna count to thirty... (pause) ...and plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Do you see any lights coming on?

Customer: (pause) No... nothing. Still completely dark.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Um, let me check a few things on our end here. (typing sounds, pause) I'm not seeing any issues with your account or your line. Do you have a battery backup unit at all? Sometimes that can cause issues if it's malfunctioning.

Customer: A battery backup? I'm not sure... I don't think so. Just the modem and the router.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful to know. Let me try one more thing. Can you look at the back of the modem for me? There should be some ports—Ethernet ports and a power port. Can you describe what you see?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, I see a bunch of ports. There's like... I dunno, five or six of them? And there's one bigger one that says power.

Agent: Perfect. And that power cable—the one that's plugged in—is it definitely secure? Sometimes these can be a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Let me... (sound of jiggling) Yeah, it seems pretty tight to me.

Agent: Alright. And you mentioned it's completely dark, right? No orange, red, or any colored lights at all?

Customer: No, nothing. It's completely dead.

Agent: (typing sounds, longer pause) Okay, I'm looking at our system and everything on our end appears to be functioning normally for your service line. At this point, it sounds like there might be an issue with the modem itself—possibly the power adapter or an internal hardware failure.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Like, is it broken?

Agent: It does appear that way, unfortunately. The modem isn't responding to power, which typically indicates a hardware issue. We can definitely get you a replacement unit sent out. But before we do that, let me try one more thing. Let me put you on a brief hold while I escalate this to our senior technical team to see if there's anything else we can try from our end. Is that okay?

Customer: Yeah, I guess so.

Agent: Thank you. I'll be right back.

(hold music plays for approximately one minute)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. I spoke with our senior tech, and given that the modem has no power indicators at all, they agree it's likely a hardware issue. The good news is we can get you a replacement modem shipped out today.

Customer: (frustrated) Today? How long is that gonna take?

Agent: If you're available, we can actually have a technician bring one by this evening, or we can ship one out and you'd have it within two business days. Which would work better for you?

Customer: I mean... tonight would be better, but how much is that gonna cost?

Agent: The replacement modem itself is covered under your service, so there's no charge for the equipment. However, the expedited technician visit would be thirty-nine ninety-five.

Customer: (pause) Tonight, you said? What time?

Agent: We typically have a window between four and eight PM. The technician would call you about thirty minutes before arrival. Does that work for you?

Customer: I mean, I'll have to make it work. Yeah, okay. Let's do tonight.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, I've got a technician dispatch for this evening. You should receive a call around 3:30 PM to confirm the time window. They'll bring a replacement modem and get you back up and running.

Customer: Okay. Um, is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope, just make sure you're home to receive it. Have your account number handy when they call. And if you have any other questions, you can always reach us back at this number.

Customer: Alright. Thanks for your help, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, sorry you're experiencing this issue. We'll get you fixed up tonight. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
