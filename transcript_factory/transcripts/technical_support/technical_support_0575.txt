Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just... it just went out. Like, completely out. I've been without service for the past couple hours and I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847. Last name is Chen.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. Chen, account ending in 0847. I'm seeing your account here. So you're currently without internet access, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. My WiFi just... nothing. No lights on the router or anything.

Agent: Alright, let's start with the basics here. Can you tell me where your modem and router are located?

Customer: They're in my living room, over by the TV stand.

Agent: Okay, and when you say there are no lights on the router, you're looking at it right now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it. It's just dark. Not even the power light is on.

Agent: Got it. That actually helps us narrow things down. First thing I'd like you to try is to make sure the power cable is fully connected to the modem and router. Can you check that for me?

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me... (rustling sounds) Hmm, actually, wait. Let me trace this back here. Oh. Oh no.

Agent: What's wrong?

Customer: The power cable... I think it got unplugged. I was moving some things around earlier and I must have... yeah, it's definitely unplugged.

Agent: No problem at all. That happens. Go ahead and plug that back in for me.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, I'm plugging it in now. (pause) Alright, it's in. So... do I need to wait a second?

Agent: Yes, actually, that's good thinking. Give it about 30 seconds to a minute to boot up. You should start seeing some lights come on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm waiting... (pause) Um, still nothing. I don't see any lights yet.

Agent: Still nothing? Let me ask you a couple questions. When you plugged it in, did you feel it click into place, or do you hear any sounds coming from the modem?

Customer: (pause) I... not really hearing anything. Let me try a different outlet. Maybe this one's bad.

Agent: That's a good idea. Go ahead and try that.

Customer: (rustling, footsteps) Okay, I'm moving over here. (pause) I've got another outlet. (pause) Plugging it in... (pause) Still nothing. No lights, no sounds, nothing.

Agent: Hmm, okay. So we're not getting any power indication at all. That's unusual. Can you unplug it for a moment and take a look at where the power cable connects to the modem itself? Make sure there's no visible damage or anything that looks out of place?

Customer: (pause) Alright, unplugging now. (rustling) Let me see here... (pause) No, I don't see anything weird. It looks fine to me. The cable looks fine.

Agent: Okay. And the modem itself, is there anything visibly damaged? Any burn marks or melting?

Customer: No, it looks... it looks totally normal. I'm confused.

Agent: Alright, let's try one more time. Go ahead and plug it back in, but this time, do me a favor and wait a full two minutes before you tell me anything. Sometimes these devices need a little extra time on the first boot.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging in... now. I'm watching it.

Agent: (pause) Alright, just let it sit for a couple minutes.

Customer: (long pause) (background noise of waiting) (pause) Okay, it's been... I don't know, probably a minute and a half now, and... I'm really not seeing anything. No lights. Nothing. This is weird.

Agent: Yeah, that is unusual. Let me ask you—do you have any other electronics plugged into that outlet? Like, does the outlet itself seem to be working?

Customer: Oh, that's... actually that's a good point. Let me try plugging my lamp in. (sounds of unplugging and plugging) No, the lamp works fine. So the outlet is fine.

Agent: Okay, so the outlet is good. (pause) Unfortunately, what this is pointing to is that your modem might have experienced some kind of hardware failure. It's not responding to power at all, which typically means an internal issue.

Customer: So it's just... broken?

Agent: It appears that way, yeah. I know that's not what you want to hear. However, the good news is that since you're a Frontier customer, we can definitely get you a replacement device. But before we go down that route, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Let me see if there's anything showing on the network side... (pause, typing)

Customer: What are you looking for?

Agent: I'm just checking to see if there's any signal coming from your location, any activity at all. If the modem is completely dead, there wouldn't be anything showing up on our end, but just let me... (pause) ...no, nothing. It's not registering anything from your address.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: So here's what we can do. We can get a replacement modem shipped out to you. Typically it takes about five to seven business days for delivery. In the meantime, unfortunately, you would be without service.

Customer: Five to seven days? That's... that's pretty long. Is there any way to speed that up?

Agent: (pause) Let me check what options we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) We do have an expedited shipping option for an additional fee of $35. That would get it to you within two to three business days.

Customer: How much additional?

Agent: It's $35 for expedited delivery.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, I guess I'll do that. But wait—before we do that, is there... I mean, is there anything else we could try? Like, any other troubleshooting steps?

Agent: I understand where you're coming from. Honestly, at this point, with no power indicator at all, we've exhausted the basic troubleshooting. The modem would need to show some kind of response to power for us to continue, and unfortunately it's not. This really does seem like a hardware issue.

Customer: Okay, so... I guess we go with the expedited shipping then.

Agent: (pause) Actually, I want to try one more thing before we commit to that. Can you check if there's a small reset button on the back of the modem? It might be recessed.

Customer: (rustling) A reset button? Let me look... (pause) I'm looking at the back. I see some ports here, but I don't... I don't see a button exactly. There's like, a small hole?

Agent: That could be it. That's usually the reset button. Do you have a paperclip or something thin and pointy?

Customer: Yeah, I can find one. Hold on. (pause, rustling) Okay, I've got a paperclip. What do I do?

Agent: Press and hold it into that hole for about 10 to 15 seconds while the device is plugged in. See if that triggers anything.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm pressing... nothing's happening. (pause) Still holding... (pause) Nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, you can stop. Yeah, unfortunately that confirms what we thought. The device has failed.

Customer: (sigh) Alright, so the expedited shipping. Can we just go ahead and do that?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to process that for you right now. (typing sounds) Just to confirm everything—we're shipping a replacement modem with expedited two to three business day delivery, and that's going to be an additional $35 charge on top of your regular service. That all correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's... that's fine. When will I get it?

Agent: Based on when we process this, you should receive it by... (typing) ...Friday or Saturday of this week, assuming today is Tuesday. We'll send you an email confirmation with a tracking number once it ships out, which should be within the next 24 hours.

Customer: Okay, alright. I guess that's the best we can do.

Agent: I apologize again that we weren't able to get this resolved today. Once your replacement arrives, it should be a simple plug-and-play setup. But if you have any issues when it arrives, don't hesitate to give us a call back.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... that's everything.

Agent: Alright, thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Your case number is 847293. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
