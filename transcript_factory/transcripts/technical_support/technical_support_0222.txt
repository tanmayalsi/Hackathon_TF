# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Thanks for picking up. So my internet just... it's completely down. It's not working at all. I've got no connection right now.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get that sorted out. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And what's the best name to have on file?

Customer: It's James. James Miller.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. So you're saying you have no internet connection at all right now?

Customer: Right, nothing. Like, I tried unplugging the modem, waiting a minute, plugging it back in. That's what everyone always says to do, you know? But it didn't help.

Agent: Yeah, that's a good first step, actually. I appreciate you trying that. So when you plug the modem back in, are you seeing any lights on it at all? Like, is it powering up?

Customer: Um, yeah. Let me look at it real quick. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. There's a couple lights on. One's like... it's greenish, I think? And then there's a red light, which... that doesn't seem good.

Agent: Okay, the red light might indicate an issue with the connection. Can you tell me which lights exactly are lit up? Is there one labeled "Internet" or "Online"?

Customer: (pause) Let me see here... there's like, a power light, I think. That's green. And then yeah, there's a red light. I'm not sure what it's for exactly.

Agent: No problem. Which port is your modem plugged into? Like, is it in the wall outlet directly?

Customer: Yeah, it's plugged into the wall. And then I have the coaxial cable... the cable connection... going into it from the wall.

Agent: Got it. And that cable connection, does it look secure? Can you just give that a gentle tug to make sure it's firmly seated?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it feels pretty solid. I don't think that's... I mean, it doesn't move or anything.

Agent: Okay, good. Let me just check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your modem registration... James, when did you last see the internet working? Was it this morning or...?

Customer: It was working fine last night. I turned everything off before bed, and when I went to use it this morning, nothing. No connection.

Agent: Alright, and you tried the restart already. That's good. Let me have you try something else. Can you unplug the modem again, but this time leave it unplugged for about two minutes?

Customer: Okay, two minutes. Sure. (pause) It's unplugged. Should I... do I wait now?

Agent: Yeah, just... just wait. I know it seems like a long time, but sometimes these devices need a harder reset. (pause) So while we're waiting here, do you have any other devices that connect to your internet? Like a computer, phone, anything?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my laptop. I tried connecting to the WiFi earlier and nothing. And my phone... same thing. Nothing.

Agent: Okay, so no devices are connecting. That's helpful information. (pause) Has there been any storms in your area recently? Any weather issues?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear. Weather's been fine.

Agent: Alright. Go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (background noise of plug being inserted) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about thirty seconds to boot back up. While it's starting, can you tell me... is your modem the equipment we provided, or do you own a personal one?

Customer: No, it's the one you guys gave me. It's been with me for... I don't know, maybe three or four years?

Agent: Okay, thank you. (pause) Alright, so it should be booted up by now. What are the lights showing you?

Customer: (pause) Um... still the same thing. There's the green light, and the red light's still there too. It's just steady red.

Agent: (pause) Okay. And there's no blinking or anything?

Customer: Nope. Just solid red.

Agent: Alright, let me check something else. Can you restart your modem by using the power button instead of unplugging it? There should be a button on the back or maybe on the bottom.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking... yeah, I see it. It's on the back. Do I just... press it?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and press and hold it for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, pressing it. (pause) And it's shutting down now. I can see the lights are going off.

Agent: Perfect. Let it sit for just a moment, and then you can press the power button again to turn it back on.

Customer: (pause) Alright, powering it back on. (pause) Okay, lights are coming back up. (pause) Same thing though... green light and a solid red light.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Alright, let me check our network in your area. Is there anything else happening on your end? Like, do you hear any beeping or anything from the modem?

Customer: No beeping. It's just... quiet except for the lights.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area right now. Let me... let me try a few more things. Is the coaxial cable the only thing connected to the modem, or do you have anything else plugged into it?

Customer: Just the coax cable from the wall. Oh, and there's an Ethernet cable. I've got that connected to my computer sometimes, but right now it's not plugged in.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. (pause) I'm going to ask you to try unplugging the coaxial cable from the modem itself. Just for a moment. Can you do that?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) It's unplugged. (pause) Now what?

Agent: Just look at the end of the coax cable. The metal end. Does it look clean, or is there any dirt or corrosion on it?

Customer: (pause) Looks pretty clean to me. Maybe a little dust, but nothing crazy.

Agent: Alright, you can go ahead and plug that back in. Make sure it's nice and tight.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. (pause) Hmm, same thing still.

Agent: (pause) I wish I had better news here, James. What we're seeing with that solid red light typically indicates a signal issue coming from our line into your home. It could be a few different things—it might be a problem with the line itself, or possibly the modem itself has developed a fault.

Customer: Oh, no. So... what does that mean? Like, is it something that can be fixed?

Agent: It might be. I can definitely set up a service appointment for you. One of our technicians can come out and check the line, make sure everything's connected properly on the outside of your house, and if necessary, they can bring out equipment to test the modem and either repair or replace it.

Customer: Okay, and how long would that take? Like, when could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. (pause) I'm looking at the next few days... how about tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM? Is that window good for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Yeah, I mean... yeah, that works. That's fine.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, this is for the address on file... (reads address)?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. You're all set. A technician will be there tomorrow morning, sometime between 8 and noon. You should get a confirmation email and a text message with more details. In the meantime, unfortunately, we won't be able to restore your service remotely, but the tech will definitely be able to help you once they arrive.

Customer: Okay, alright. I guess I'll just... I'll be without internet until then. That's not ideal, but I understand. Thanks for trying, anyway.

Agent: I really do apologize for the inconvenience, James. I wish I had a quicker solution for you. The technician tomorrow should be able to get to the bottom of it. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's... I think that's everything. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll get this resolved for you tomorrow. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
