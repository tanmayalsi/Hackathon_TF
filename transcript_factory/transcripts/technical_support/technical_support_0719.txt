Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it working because I'm trying to work from home.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me just... there we go. I've got you pulled up here. I'm showing an account for Michael Torres at 422 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have you experienced any service interruptions recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time in like... I don't know, months maybe. It's just completely dead. I tried unplugging my router and plugging it back in, which is usually what I do, but nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's actually a good first step. So when you plugged it back in, did you see any lights on the router at all?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually. Let me look at it again real quick. (pause) Okay, so the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light... I think that one's normally blue, right? It's not on at all.

Agent: Right, so the internet light should be blue and solid when everything's connected properly. The fact that it's off tells me there might be a connection issue between the router and our network. Let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) Are you able to see the Frontier WiFi network on your phone or any other device?

Customer: No, I don't see it at all. I'm looking right now and... yeah, nothing.

Agent: Okay. And just to confirm, you're on our Fiber service, correct?

Customer: Yeah, the Fiber 100 plan.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, Michael, I'm going to check if there's an outage in your area real quick. (pause, typing sounds) I'm not showing any active outages on our end. So what I'd like to do is have you check the ONT—that's the small white box that should be mounted on the outside of your house or in a closet.

Customer: Oh, um... I think it's in the basement actually. Let me go grab it. (sounds of movement, footsteps)

Agent: Take your time.

Customer: (slightly out of breath) Okay, I'm back. So I'm looking at it and... there's a bunch of lights on it. Let's see, I see green, amber, I think there's a red one...

Agent: Okay, can you tell me which lights are on and what color they are? Starting from the left?

Customer: From the left? Um... there's a green one, then there's like a red or orange one, then there's another one that looks... I'm not sure, it might be off. It's kind of hard to see down here.

Agent: (pause) The red or orange light is actually what concerns me. That usually indicates an alarm or error state. Is there any physical damage to the box that you can see? Any loose cables?

Customer: No, it looks fine to me. But wait, let me... (pause) Oh, there's a cable that came a little bit loose. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. Go ahead and do that. That could be exactly what we need.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay... (pause) It's back in. Should I do anything else?

Agent: Let's give it about thirty seconds to re-establish the connection and see if those lights change. (longer pause) Okay, what are you seeing now?

Customer: Um... the red one's still there. Maybe it got a little brighter? I'm not really sure. The green light is definitely still on though.

Agent: Alright, that red light persisting is unusual. Let me try to restart things from our end. I'm going to send a restart signal to your ONT. This should take about five minutes or so. Can you stay on the line with me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. How long do you think this'll take total?

Agent: Hopefully just a few more minutes. (pause) Okay, the signal's been sent. What we should see is the lights going dark for a moment, and then they'll come back up. Can you keep an eye on those lights for me?

Customer: Yeah, I'm watching... and... okay, they all went dark. Now they're... (pause) okay, some are coming back. I see green again, but that red one... it's back too.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Hmm. Okay, let me check something here. (longer pause) Michael, I'm actually seeing a hardware failure alert on your ONT. That would explain why the connection isn't coming back after the restart. Unfortunately, that's the piece of equipment that connects your fiber line to your router.

Customer: Oh no. So what does that mean? How long will it take to fix?

Agent: So we would need to send a technician out to replace that unit. Typically we can get someone out within 24 to 48 hours depending on availability. Let me check our schedule here... (typing sounds) I'm showing that we could potentially get someone out to you tomorrow between 2 and 6 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean... I guess it'll have to. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to get it working again?

Agent: Unfortunately, without a functioning ONT, there's not much we can do on the customer side. The box itself needs to be replaced. I wish I had better news.

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, okay. Well, can you get me that appointment set up then?

Agent: Absolutely. Before I do that, let me just try one more thing real quick. Sometimes if I power cycle your router at the same time as restarting the ONT, it can help. Let me send another restart to the ONT. Can you unplug your router for me?

Customer: Sure. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Okay, restart signal is being sent. Let's give it thirty seconds and then go ahead and plug your router back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in now. (pause) The lights are coming back on but... same thing. Still no blue light. Just the power.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, unfortunately that confirms what I'm seeing on my end. The ONT definitely needs to be replaced. I'm sorry we couldn't get this working remotely for you.

Customer: No, I get it. It happens. So tomorrow between 2 and 6, you said?

Agent: Yes, tomorrow between 2 PM and 6 PM. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, I've got you down for a service visit tomorrow. A technician will come out and replace the ONT. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly with more details. And just so you know, this replacement is covered under your service agreement, so there's no charge for it.

Customer: Oh, that's good at least. Thanks for trying to figure this out anyway, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. I really am sorry we couldn't get you back online today. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I guess I'll see the technician tomorrow.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and sorry again for the inconvenience. Have a great day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
