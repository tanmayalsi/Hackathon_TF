Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm seeing an account here for... Robert Chen at 2341 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So your internet service went down this morning around... what time would you say that was?

Customer: I'd say around 8 AM. I was trying to work from home and just... nothing. No internet at all.

Agent: Okay, and just to confirm—are you seeing any lights on your modem and router right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, actually. The modem has a couple lights on it. They're like... blinking red, I think? And the router is... I'm not sure. It's kind of in the other room.

Agent: Okay, red lights usually indicate there's an issue with the connection. Can you do me a favor and walk over to your router for me?

Customer: Sure, yeah, one second. (background noise, footsteps) Okay, I'm here. It's got some lights on it too. There's a green one and then... I don't know, there's some blinking.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful. What I'm going to have you do is perform a quick restart. Can you locate the power cable on the back of your modem?

Customer: The modem's in the living room, so yeah, I can see it from here. Do you want me to unplug it?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Go ahead and unplug the modem from the power outlet.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now I'm going to have you wait about 30 seconds while that powers down completely. Just give it a moment.

Customer: Alright... (long pause) ...this is taking forever.

Agent: I know it feels like it. Just a few more seconds... go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause, sound of cable being inserted) Okay, it's back in. Now what?

Agent: Now we're going to let it boot back up. This usually takes about two to three minutes. While that's happening, let me ask you a few questions. Have you had any storms in your area recently?

Customer: Um, there was one last night, actually. Pretty bad thunderstorm around midnight or so.

Agent: That could definitely be a factor. Sometimes lightning strikes or power surges can affect the equipment. What I'm looking at here is... (typing sounds) ...I'm not showing any outages in your area, so that's a good sign. Your modem should be fully booted up now. Are you seeing any green lights?

Customer: Yeah, actually I am. There's a green light now. Should I check the router?

Agent: Yes, please do. Tell me what you're seeing.

Customer: (footsteps) Okay, so the router has... it has a green light too, and one that's blinking. Is that normal?

Agent: The blinking is normal—that usually indicates data transfer. The important thing is that you have solid green lights on the modem. Can you try opening a browser on your computer now? Just pull up any website and see if it loads.

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) Let me try... I'm going to go to Google.

Agent: Perfect.

Customer: (long pause) ...Nothing. It's still just showing... like, the page isn't loading. It just keeps spinning.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try a few other things. Can you tell me—is your computer connected via WiFi or ethernet cable?

Customer: WiFi. Should I try... should I plug it in with a cable instead?

Agent: That's actually a great idea. That'll help us determine if it's a WiFi issue or something else. Do you have an ethernet cable?

Customer: I think I have one somewhere. (pause) Give me a second to look. Yeah, I found one. I'm going to plug it in.

Agent: Great. (typing sounds) While you're doing that, I'm going to run a quick diagnostic on our end.

Customer: (more pause, sounds of cables moving around) Okay, it's plugged in now. Should I restart my computer or...?

Agent: Let's give it about 20 seconds first. Just see if it automatically recognizes the connection.

Customer: (pause) ...No, still nothing. The connection icon isn't showing anything different.

Agent: Alright. Can you restart your computer for me? That should help it recognize the ethernet connection.

Customer: Sure. (pause) It's restarting now. This could take a minute or two.

Agent: [inaudible] No problem. While we wait, have you noticed any issues with the equipment recently? Any unusual sounds or anything like that?

Customer: Not that I know of. Everything seemed fine yesterday.

Agent: (pause) Okay, and you mentioned the storm last night. Did you happen to lose power at all?

Customer: Actually, yeah. I think we did for like a second or two. I remember the TV going out.

Agent: That's probably what happened then. That power surge may have damaged the modem. The restart should have helped, but... okay, the computer should be booted up now. Try accessing the internet again.

Customer: (pause) Let me try Google again... (longer pause) ...Nope. Still nothing. It's just loading and loading. This is really strange.

Agent: Yeah, that is odd. Okay, what I'm going to do is check the signal strength coming into your modem. Let me see here... (typing sounds, long pause) ...Robert, I'm actually not seeing a signal being received by your modem at all on our end. That suggests the issue might be with the line coming into your home or the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, what do I do?

Agent: Unfortunately, at this point, we're probably looking at either a damaged modem due to that power surge, or there's an issue with the line running to your house. Given the storm last night, either one is possible.

Customer: Can't you just send a technician out?

Agent: Absolutely, we can schedule a technician to come out and take a look. Typically we can get someone out within 24 to 48 hours. But I do want to try one more thing first before we do that. Let me have you check something on the modem itself. Can you see if there's a reset button?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's a little button here on the back. It's pretty small.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to warn you—if you press this, it will reset the modem to factory settings, which means you'll lose your WiFi settings and everything. But it might help. Are you okay with trying that?

Customer: Uh... I guess so. What do I do?

Agent: You'll need to hold that button down for about 10 to 15 seconds. You might need a paperclip or something small to press it.

Customer: I'll just use a pen. (pause) Okay, I'm holding it down... (pause, beeping sounds) ...I think that did something. The lights are all going crazy now.

Agent: That's normal. Just let it sit for a few minutes while it resets and boots back up.

Customer: (long pause) How long are we talking here?

Agent: Usually about two to three minutes, similar to before.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, my computer's still not showing any internet connection at all. And... (pause) ...Robert, I've been looking at the modem and I'm actually noticing something. There's like... there's a burn mark on the back of it. I didn't see that before.

Agent: (pause) A burn mark?

Customer: Yeah, like a dark spot on the plastic. That's... that's not good, is it?

Agent: That actually confirms what I suspected. That power surge definitely damaged your modem. I'm sorry, Robert. Unfortunately, there's not much we can do to troubleshoot a damaged modem.

Customer: So I need a new one?

Agent: Yes, you're going to need a replacement modem. Here's what I'm going to do—I can have a technician bring one out to you and install it. I can get someone scheduled for tomorrow afternoon if that works for you. It won't cost you anything for the modem replacement since it's due to weather damage.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon? I really need internet today. I'm supposed to be working from home.

Agent: I completely understand how urgent that is. Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds, long pause) I'm looking at our available appointments... The earliest I can get someone out is... (pause) ...looks like tomorrow between 1 and 4 PM. That's the soonest we have available in your area. I wish I had something sooner.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Okay, I guess that'll have to work. Can you at least email me or something to confirm that appointment?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to send a confirmation email to the address we have on file—that should be [inaudible]@frontier.net?

Customer: No, it's at Gmail. It's robert.chen at Gmail dot com.

Agent: Let me update that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, robert.chen at Gmail—got it. You should receive confirmation within the next few minutes. The appointment number is 4827-19. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you today?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's all. I just hope the technician can actually fix this tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident they will, Robert. The modem replacement should get you back up and running right away. I'm sorry you had to deal with this today, especially after that storm. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, Robert. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
