Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet just went out completely. Like, I can't get online at all. I've been without service for like an hour now and I'm really frustrated.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I'm seeing your account for... is this Michael?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. So you're completely without internet service right now. Can you tell me what you're seeing? Like, is your modem powered on?

Customer: Um... let me check. (pause) Yeah, I can see it over there. It's got some lights on it. The power light is on, I think, but... I don't know, some of the other lights look weird. They're not the normal color.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Can you describe what you're seeing? Like, what color are the lights and which ones are lit up?

Customer: So there's... there's one that's like green I think? And then there's others that are kind of... reddish? Or orange? I'm not totally sure. There's a lot of them.

Agent: Okay, so if you're seeing red or orange lights, that usually indicates there might be a connection issue. Let me try a few things here. First, can you unplug the modem completely? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, it's unplugged. The lights went off.

Agent: Good. Can you leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds? I'm going to... while we wait here, let me check if there are any service outages in your area. What's your address?

Customer: It's 4521 Maple Street, apartment 3B. In... in Springfield.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 4521 Maple Street, 3B. (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area right now, so that's... that's actually a good sign. It's probably something we can fix. Go ahead and plug that modem back in for me.

Customer: Okay. (pause) It's plugged back in. The lights are coming back on.

Agent: Perfect. So now I want you to just give it about, uh, thirty to forty seconds for it to fully boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me... have you noticed anything unusual before the internet went out? Like, a storm, power flicker, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine this morning and then around like 2 o'clock it just... died.

Agent: Alright. And you said it's been about an hour?

Customer: Yeah, roughly an hour.

Agent: Okay. (pause) So, what are you seeing on the modem now?

Customer: Um, the lights are all on now. It's all lit up. But I still can't... I still don't have internet. My laptop is showing no connection.

Agent: Okay, so the modem appears to be powered up. Let me ask you this—do you have a wireless router separate from your modem, or is it all in one unit?

Customer: I... I think it's all in one? It's just the one device that Frontier gave me when I signed up.

Agent: Perfect, that's what I thought. Okay, so what I'm going to do is check the status of your modem remotely here. (typing sounds) Let me see... (pause) Hmm, I'm having a little trouble connecting to it on my end. Um, can you look at the modem again and tell me what color the internet light is? It might be labeled "Internet" or "Online" or sometimes it just says "WAN."

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... I'm looking at it now. There's one that says "Internet" and it's... it's orange. Or red. Definitely not green.

Agent: Red or orange—that's not good. That usually means it's not getting a signal from our network. (pause) Okay, I want to try something. Can you locate the reset button on the modem? It's usually a small hole you have to press with like a paperclip or something.

Customer: [inaudible] this thing... yeah, I think I see it. There's a little button on the back.

Agent: Right, so don't press it yet. If you press that, it'll erase all your settings. I don't want to do that unless we absolutely have to. First, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Can you just give me a minute here?

Customer: Yeah, no problem.

Agent: (pause) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I'm checking our system and... I'm not seeing any issues with the line coming into your building from our network. That's strange. (pause) This might sound silly, but I have to ask—you're sure the cable is plugged in? The coaxial cable that goes into the modem?

Customer: (slight laugh) Yeah, I mean, it's plugged in. But let me... let me actually check it really carefully. (pause) Okay, it's plugged in. It feels secure.

Agent: Alright, I had to ask. Okay, so let's try another power cycle, but this time I want you to also unplug the power cable for a full two minutes. This is a deeper reset than before. Can you do that?

Customer: Sure, yeah. Let me unplug it. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. Should I just... wait?

Agent: Yeah, just wait about two minutes. I know it's a little tedious, but sometimes the modem just needs that full reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm waiting. So like... is this something that happens a lot? Because this is really not ideal timing for me.

Agent: I understand. Most of the time when we see something like this, it's either a temporary glitch that a power cycle fixes, or it's something with the line connection. We'll figure it out. Do you have any urgent things you need the internet for?

Customer: I mean, I'm working from home so, yeah, I kind of need it.

Agent: Yeah, I totally get it. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. Lights are coming on again... and... (pause) nope. Still the same thing. Internet light is still red.

Agent: (sigh) Okay. That's... that's unfortunate. Let me try one more thing. Can you check the other cable connections on the modem? There might be another cable going in. Sometimes there's a phone line or something else. Can you just verify everything is seated correctly?

Customer: (pause) I mean, there's just the one cable I can see. The main one that comes in from the wall.

Agent: Okay, that should be the coaxial cable. And that's definitely connected?

Customer: Yeah, it's connected.

Agent: (pause) Alright, Michael, I'm going to be honest with you. Based on what we're seeing here, it sounds like there might be an issue with the line itself coming into your apartment, or possibly with the modem hardware. Since the power cycle isn't helping and I'm not seeing any issues on the network side, I think we need to get a technician out there to take a look.

Customer: Oh... so I can't fix this myself?

Agent: Unfortunately, it doesn't look like it. But the good news is we can get someone out there pretty quickly. Let me check availability. (typing sounds) How does tomorrow between 9 and 12 sound?

Customer: I mean, I guess I have to work with it, right? Yeah, tomorrow morning works.

Agent: Great. I'm going to schedule a technician visit for you tomorrow between 9 a.m. and noon. A technician will come out and check the line connection and potentially replace the modem if necessary. You should get a confirmation call about an hour before they arrive.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: Honestly, I'd just leave it powered off until the technician gets there tomorrow. That way if there's something overheating, it'll have time to cool down. We don't want to make it worse.

Customer: Alright, I guess that makes sense. So just to confirm, tomorrow morning, 9 to 12?

Agent: That's correct. 9 a.m. to noon tomorrow. Is the phone number we have on file 555-0147 still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. I really apologize that we couldn't get this resolved today, Michael. I know it's frustrating.

Customer: Yeah, well, hopefully your technician can figure it out.

Agent: I'm sure they will. They're very good at what they do. Thanks for your patience today, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye, Michael.
