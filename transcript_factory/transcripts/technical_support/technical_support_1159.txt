Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back online. It's been down for like two hours now.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account here... and I see you're in the Westfield area on our fiber service. Let me ask you a few quick questions. When you say the internet is down, are you getting any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um, let me check. (pause) Okay, so the modem has a light on—it's like a white light on the top—but the internet light, I think it's the one that shows the connection, it's not on. It's dark.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful. And the power light is on, so we know it has electricity. Let me have you try a quick restart. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Yeah, doing it now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Let it sit unplugged for about thirty seconds, just to fully drain the system.

Customer: (pause) Okay... thirty seconds feels like forever, doesn't it? (nervous laugh)

Agent: (chuckles) I know, I know. Alright, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: Done. (pause) So now I just... wait?

Agent: Yeah, just give it about two to three minutes to fully boot back up. You should see the lights start to come back on. Can you keep an eye on it for me?

Customer: Yeah, I'm watching it. (pause) Okay, um, the white light came back... and it's been, like, three minutes. But that internet light is still not coming on.

Agent: Still nothing, huh? Okay. Let me check on our end here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area, so it's likely something specific to your account or equipment. Let me ask—do you have a separate router, or are you using just the modem?

Customer: I have a separate router. It's connected to the modem with an Ethernet cable.

Agent: Perfect. Can you check the cables for me? Make sure the Ethernet cable going from the modem to the router is fully connected on both ends. Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it now... (pause) Actually, hmm, one end looks a little loose. Let me push it in. (pause) Okay, I pushed it in pretty firmly. (pause) Oh! Wait, I think I see it now—one of the lights on the router is coming on!

Agent: Oh, that's great! So you got it reconnected. Give it another minute or so to fully sync up.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) I'm opening my browser now... (pause) Hmm, it's loading... (pause) No, no, it's just spinning. It's not loading. The light came on but it's still not working.

Agent: Alright, let's try a few more things. Can you restart the router this time?

Customer: The router? Sure. (pause) I'm unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, waiting... (pause) Plugged it back in.

Agent: While that's booting up, let me run a line test from our end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm. Okay, I'm not getting a signal on the line side. That's interesting.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: Well, it typically means either the connection from the street to your house has been interrupted, or there's an issue with the optical network terminal—that's the box that brings the fiber signal into your home. Did you notice any weather last night? Any storms, wind, anything like that?

Customer: No, not really. I mean, it was a little windy, but nothing major. Why?

Agent: Just trying to rule out if maybe something came loose. The fiber lines can sometimes get affected by high winds or weather events. (pause) Okay, so the router should be rebooted by now. Are you getting that internet light on the modem yet?

Customer: (pause) No, still dark. That's... not good, right?

Agent: Well, let me check if the modem itself needs a firmware update or if there's anything on my end I can push to it. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm sending a refresh command to your modem right now. Give it about a minute.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Still nothing. (pause) How long does this usually take?

Agent: It should be pretty quick. (pause) Is anything happening at all? Any blinking lights or anything changing?

Customer: The white light is still on, but the internet light... no, still off. (pause) This is really frustrating. I need this for work.

Agent: I completely understand. I know this is frustrating. Alright, let me escalate this. What I'm seeing here is that we're not getting a connection on the line side, which suggests there might be an issue with either the fiber line to your address or the ONT—that's the optical box I mentioned. I'm not able to troubleshoot that remotely.

Customer: So what does that mean? Do I need to call someone out?

Agent: Yes, I'm going to schedule a technician visit for you. Let me get some information. Are you available tomorrow during the day, or would you prefer another time?

Customer: Um, tomorrow morning would be better, if you have an opening.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have... Okay, I can get someone out there between 8 AM and 12 PM tomorrow. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. So I have a technician scheduled for tomorrow morning, between 8 and noon, at 555-0147 on Maple Street. That's correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. You'll receive a confirmation text and email shortly. If anything changes or if the internet miraculously comes back before then, just give us a call. But I suspect it's going to need an on-site visit.

Customer: Okay. I really hope it's not too expensive to fix.

Agent: I understand. The technician will be able to assess it and let you know what's going on. In the meantime, if you have any other questions, feel free to call back. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone, but we'll get you taken care of tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier. Goodbye!
