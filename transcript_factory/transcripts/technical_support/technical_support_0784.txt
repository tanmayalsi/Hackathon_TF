# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I've been without internet since this morning and I'm really frustrated. I work from home and I have meetings I need to get on.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you're experiencing issues. Let me help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And what name is the account under?

Customer: Michael Chen.

Agent: Thank you, Michael. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember approximately what time that happened?

Customer: Um, around 9 AM, I think. I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing was working.

Agent: Okay. And just to confirm—you have our Fiber internet service, correct?

Customer: Yes, the 500 Mbps plan.

Agent: Great. All right, let me pull up your account here. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm showing your service is active on our end. Let me walk you through a few troubleshooting steps, okay?

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is there any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um, let me look. (pause) So I see the modem—it's blinking red on the power light, and then there's like... nothing on the internet light. It's just dark.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is red. That's actually not typical. Usually that should be solid green or blue. Have you tried unplugging the modem yet?

Customer: No, not yet. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yes, please. Go ahead and unplug it from the wall, and then wait about 30 seconds before plugging it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) All right, I'm waiting...

Agent: Take your time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in... (pause) It's starting up. Um, I see the lights are coming on now. The power light is... still kind of red? Like a reddish color.

Agent: Hmm, still red? That's unusual. Michael, can you look at the model number on the modem for me? It should be on a sticker on the bottom or back.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It says... FXC-6300.

Agent: Okay, the 6300 model. (typing sounds) And you said the internet light isn't turning on at all?

Customer: No, it's just dark. The other lights are on now after the restart, but nothing on the internet light.

Agent: All right. And are you able to see any Wi-Fi networks available on your phone or laptop right now?

Customer: Let me check. (pause) No, I don't see our network. It's not showing up at all.

Agent: Okay. That indicates the modem isn't fully connecting to our network. Let's try another restart, but this time we'll do what's called a factory reset. Can you locate the small reset button on the modem? It's usually recessed, so you might need a paperclip.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's a little hole here on the back.

Agent: Perfect. So while it's still powered on, I want you to hold down that reset button for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Holding it now... (pause) ...and releasing. (pause) Okay, now what?

Agent: Now let's wait for it to fully restart. This might take a couple minutes. While we wait, can I ask—did you notice any storms last night or early this morning? Any power issues?

Customer: (pause) Actually, yeah. There was some lightning around midnight. The power flickered a few times. I didn't think it would affect anything though.

Agent: That could definitely be it. Sometimes electrical surges can damage modem equipment. Let's see if this restart helps. (pause) Are you seeing any change in the lights now?

Customer: Um... (pause) The power light is still red. It hasn't changed. The internet light is still off.

Agent: Still red? Okay. And you're not seeing any Wi-Fi networks available?

Customer: No, nothing. [inaudible] This is really frustrating. I have a call in like 15 minutes.

Agent: I understand. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) (pause) It looks like there might be a service issue in your area or a problem with the equipment. The modem might have been damaged by that power surge you mentioned. I'm going to check if we have any outages reported in your area.

Customer: (pause) Okay...

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area, which suggests this is likely equipment-related. Do you have a coaxial cable—the thick cable that connects the modem to the wall outlet?

Customer: Yeah, I do. It's right there.

Agent: Can you unplug it from the modem and then plug it back in? Make sure it's nice and tight.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it... reconnecting it... (pause) It's connected. But nothing changed.

Agent: (pause) All right. I'm going to be honest with you, Michael. Given the power surge and the symptoms we're seeing—the red power light, no internet connection, no Wi-Fi—I suspect the modem may have been damaged. Unfortunately, we may need to get you a replacement unit.

Customer: Seriously? So you can't fix this remotely?

Agent: (pause) I wish I could. We've done the standard troubleshooting steps, and the modem isn't responding the way it should. The red power light typically indicates a hardware issue rather than a connectivity problem.

Customer: (sigh) What does that mean for me? How long does a replacement take?

Agent: That's a great question. So I can order you a replacement modem right now, and we have expedited shipping available. If we process this today, you could have it by tomorrow afternoon. However, I do want to be transparent—you'd be without service until the replacement arrives.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon? I need internet today. I have work meetings all day.

Agent: (pause) I totally understand that's not ideal. Let me see... (typing sounds) Do you have a mobile hotspot on your phone? Or is there anywhere nearby you could temporarily use Wi-Fi while we get you sorted?

Customer: I mean, I have hotspot, but my data plan is super limited. And I can't really work from a coffee shop with all my files at home.

Agent: Yeah, that's a tough situation. Um, let me put you on a quick hold while I check with my supervisor to see if there's any other option we might have. It'll just be a moment.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (hold music) (pause) (click) Okay, Michael, I'm back. Unfortunately, we don't have any field technicians available to come out today, and the replacement modem is going to be our best solution. But I want to make sure we get you expedited shipping at no charge given the circumstances.

Customer: Okay... I guess that's something. So what do I need to do?

Agent: (typing sounds) So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to process a replacement modem order right now. Can I get a good address to ship it to?

Customer: Yeah, it's 447 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B, Columbus, Ohio, 43215.

Agent: (typing sounds) 447 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B, Columbus, 43215. Perfect. (pause) And the best contact number is 555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's my cell.

Agent: All right. (typing sounds) Okay, the replacement modem is ordered and you should receive it by 6 PM tomorrow. Once you get it, the setup is very similar to what you have now. Just plug it in, wait for the lights to stabilize, and your network should show up automatically.

Customer: Do I need to do anything else?

Agent: Not really. Just make sure to unpack it and plug it in when it arrives. If you have any trouble after that, you can call us back. We'll have all of this documented in your account.

Customer: (pause) All right. Is there any discount or credit I should be getting for being down for a whole day?

Agent: That's a fair question. Let me look into that for you. (typing sounds) (pause) Given the circumstances and your expedited replacement, I'm going to add a $15 credit to your next bill as an apology for the inconvenience.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. Anything else I should know?

Agent: No, I think we're all set. Just watch for the package tomorrow. And again, I'm really sorry you're dealing with this, especially when you need internet for work.

Customer: Yeah, well, thank you for trying. I guess I'll see what happens tomorrow.

Agent: Sounds good, Michael. Thank you for being patient with us, and we really appreciate your business. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
