# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just completely stopped working about an hour ago. One minute it was fine, and now there's nothing. I've got my laptop and my phone, and neither one can connect.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. First, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Mike Tannen. T-A-N-N-E-N.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it, Mike. And I'm showing you're at... 4521 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So your internet went down about an hour ago. Have you tried power cycling your modem and router yet?

Customer: Um, I unplugged the modem, yeah. I waited a minute and plugged it back in. But the router's still in the same spot. Should I do that too?

Agent: Yes, definitely. Let's do a full restart. Go ahead and unplug both your modem and your router, and then we'll wait about two minutes before plugging them back in. Start with the modem first.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Both are unplugged. I'm setting a timer.

Agent: Perfect. While we wait, let me just... (typing sounds) ...I'm pulling up your service history here. It looks like you've been with us for about two years. Have you had any service issues before this?

Customer: No, actually, everything's been pretty solid. This is the first time something like this has happened.

Agent: That's good to know. Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: Okay. (pause) It's powered back on. Lights are coming on... I see the power light, the internet light is... (pause) ...it's orange. I think it's orange. Is that normal?

Agent: The orange light usually means it's still booting up or trying to establish a connection. Give that about thirty seconds to stabilize, and then we can plug the router back in.

Customer: Alright. (pause, background noise of household activity) Okay, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Go ahead and plug the router in.

Customer: Doing it now. (pause) It's on. The lights are... similar to before. I've got some lights on, some blinking.

Agent: Okay. Let's give that another minute or so to fully boot up and establish a connection. While we're waiting, are you noticing any other issues? Any power outages in your area or anything like that?

Customer: Not that I know of. My TV is working fine, everything else has power.

Agent: Good. And just to confirm, you're not able to connect on either Wi-Fi or ethernet cable?

Customer: Right, neither one works. I tried both.

Agent: Alright. Check the modem now. What color is the internet light?

Customer: (pause) It's still orange. Hmm. That doesn't seem right, does it?

Agent: Yeah, that's... that's not what we want to see. It should be solid green or blue depending on your modem model. Let me check a few things on our end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your connection status here, and... I'm actually not seeing an active connection from your modem.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: It means the modem isn't successfully connecting to our network. This could be a few things—it could be an issue on our end, a problem with the modem itself, or potentially an issue with the line coming into your house. Let me check if there are any service alerts or outages in your area.

Customer: (pause) Okay...

Agent: (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any active outages in your area, so that's good news. But I am seeing a signal issue. The signal strength we're receiving from your modem is very low. Have you checked the cable connections? The coax cable going into the modem?

Customer: Um, let me look. (pause) It looks plugged in to me. It's the cable that comes from the wall, right?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Can you try unplugging that cable from the modem and plugging it back in?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Okay, it's back in. The light is still orange though.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Let me try one more thing. Let's restart the modem one more time, but this time I want you to hold the reset button for about ten seconds. There should be a small reset button on the back of the modem.

Customer: Okay, I'm looking... I found it. It's a tiny button back here. (pause) Holding it now. Ten seconds, right?

Agent: That's right.

Customer: (pause) Okay, released it. The lights went out and now they're coming back on.

Agent: Good. Let's give it another minute and a half to fully reboot.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Still orange. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize. Unfortunately, that didn't do the trick. Let me check a couple more things from my end. (typing sounds, longer pause) Mike, I'm looking at this signal issue, and I'm also seeing some error logs on the line. This could potentially indicate a problem with the line coming into your premises or an issue at our equipment on the street. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: So here's what I'm going to do. I want to escalate this to our technical team. They have the ability to check the line remotely and potentially send a technician out if needed. But I'm not able to fully troubleshoot this remotely—we've tried the basics and the problem seems to be more involved than that.

Customer: How long would that take? I need my internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get you scheduled with a technician. They typically have availability within the next 24 to 48 hours, depending on demand. And we can potentially expedite it if you have a business account, but I'm seeing you're on our standard residential plan.

Customer: Okay, so I'm basically without internet until then?

Agent: Unfortunately, it's looking that way based on what we're seeing. I'm really sorry about this. Let me get you set up with a service appointment. What days work best for you?

Customer: I guess tomorrow, if that's possible. Morning would be better than the afternoon.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability... I can get you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Perfect. You're all set for tomorrow, 8 AM to noon, at your address on Maple Drive. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. In the meantime, if you need internet access, you might want to consider using a mobile hotspot from your phone if you have that available.

Customer: Yeah, I can do that, I guess. Is there anything else I can try tonight?

Agent: (pause) At this point, I don't think so. We've done the standard troubleshooting, and the issue appears to be on the line side. The technician tomorrow will be able to test the physical line and the equipment.

Customer: Alright. So that's it?

Agent: That's it for now. But you're going to be okay. We'll get this resolved tomorrow. Your confirmation number for the appointment is 847392. Do you have that?

Customer: 847392, yeah, I got it.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today, Mike. I know that's frustrating. The technician tomorrow will take great care of you. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
