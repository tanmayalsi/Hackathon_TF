# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the router and everything.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm showing an account for James Martinez at 4821 Riverside Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you're experiencing no internet connection at all this morning. When did you first notice the issue?

Customer: I'd say around 7 AM? I tried to check my email and nothing was working. Like, the router's still on—I can see the lights—but there's no actual internet getting through.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. And you've already tried unplugging the router?

Customer: Yeah, I unplugged it for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in. That's usually what fixes it, but not this time.

Agent: Good troubleshooting step. Let me check our systems to see if there are any outages in your area. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any active outages reported in your neighborhood right now, so let's dig a little deeper. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your router?

Customer: Um... (pause) there's a green light on the power, and I think there's a blue one blinking on the... I don't know, the internet part? But nothing's connecting.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is steady green and there's a blinking blue light. That's usually the internet or connectivity light. That blinking typically means it's trying to establish a connection but hasn't quite gotten there yet.

Customer: So what do I do?

Agent: Let's try a full factory reset. I know you unplugged it briefly, but this time I want you to unplug the power cable from the back of your modem—and I mean the device that's connected directly to the wall outlet, not the router.

Customer: The modem? (pause) I'm not sure which one that is. I have like... two boxes?

Agent: Right, so you should have two devices. One is the modem, and one is the router. The modem is typically the one that's connected to the wall outlet with a cable line coming into it. Does that sound familiar?

Customer: Oh! Yeah, okay. I see it now. It's the one with the cable going into the back of it.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and unplug that one for me, please.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: And now just leave it unplugged for about two minutes while I ask you a few questions. Have you experienced any storms in your area recently, or any power outages?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Just been normal weather. Why?

Agent: Sometimes environmental factors or power surges can cause connection issues. Have you noticed any unusual activity—like service technicians in your area, any digging or construction?

Customer: Not that I've seen, no.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Go ahead and plug the modem back in now, and we'll give it about three to four minutes to fully boot back up.

Customer: (pause) It's plugged back in. (pause) The lights are coming back on now.

Agent: Perfect. Once you see the internet light turn solid blue or green—depending on your model—that should mean it's reconnected. Let me know when you see that.

Customer: (long pause) Uh... it's still blinking. It's been like a minute and a half. (pause) Still blinking blue.

Agent: Still blinking. Okay. Sometimes this takes a few minutes. Let's give it another minute or two. While we're waiting, I do want to check something else. When you look at the back of your modem, can you tell me if there's an ethernet cable connected to it?

Customer: A... ethernet cable? I think so? There's like a cord that goes from the modem to the router.

Agent: That's the ethernet cable. That's good. That should be connected. Alright, let's check on those lights again.

Customer: (pause) Still blinking. Still just the blinking blue light on the modem.

Agent: Still blinking. (pause) Okay, I want to try one more thing. On the back of your modem, there should be a small reset button. It's usually recessed, so you might need something like a paperclip to press it. Do you see that?

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) yeah, I think I see it. There's a tiny button back here. This is the reset?

Agent: That's the one. I'm going to have you hold that button down for about ten seconds. This will completely reset your modem to factory settings, so just be prepared for everything to take a few minutes to come back online.

Customer: Okay. (pause) I'm holding it now. (pause) Ten seconds?

Agent: Yes, about ten seconds. You should see the lights turn off and then come back on.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, I see them going off. I'm still holding. (pause) Okay, letting go now.

Agent: Good. Now we're going to let it fully restart. This should take about three to four minutes. I'm going to stay on the line with you.

Customer: Okay, yeah. (pause) It's restarting now. The lights went dark for a second. (pause) Now they're back on.

Agent: (typing sounds) While we're waiting, I'm going to review your account here and see if there might be anything on our end. Just give it another moment.

Customer: (background noise of tv in distance) (long pause) It's still blinking. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me ask you—have you recently changed your password or made any changes to your setup?

Customer: No, nothing like that.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Alright, so the modem still isn't establishing a connection. Let me try something on our end. I'm going to cycle your connection at the main hub here.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: Essentially, I'm going to disconnect and reconnect your service line from our system. It usually takes about a minute to process. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I've initiated that. Let's wait a moment.

Customer: (pause) Alright. Still blinking over here.

Agent: (pause) Still blinking. Hmm. (pause) Okay, so I've tried the cycle and it doesn't seem to be taking effect on our end. I'm starting to suspect there might be a hardware issue with your modem. 

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It means the modem itself might be failing and might need to be replaced. Typically, that would require a technician visit.

Customer: A technician? When can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (pause) (typing sounds) The earliest I can schedule is Tuesday, between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tuesday? That's four days away. Is there anything else we can try before then?

Agent: (pause) Well, I can walk you through a few more diagnostic steps if you'd like, but honestly, given the symptoms—the fact that the modem lights aren't establishing a proper connection even after a full reset—I'm fairly confident it's a hardware issue. But let me try one more thing. Can you check if there's a coaxial cable connected to your modem? It's usually a thick cable with a screw on each end.

Customer: Yeah, I see one. It's screwed in pretty tight.

Agent: Can you try unscrewing it and checking if there's any dirt or debris on the connector?

Customer: (pause) It's... pretty clean, I think. (pause) I'm screwing it back in. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay. (long pause) I wish I had better news for you, James. Given what we've tried, I really do think this is a modem issue. The Tuesday appointment is probably your best bet.

Customer: That's really the only option?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. I can get you on the schedule for Tuesday, and there's no charge for the technician visit or modem replacement if it is indeed the modem. You'd just be without service until then.

Customer: (frustrated) Alright. Fine. Tuesday, 1 to 5 PM.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. Is the address still 4821 Riverside Drive?

Customer: Yes.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I have that set up for you. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: I apologize that we couldn't get you back online today, James. We'll have you up and running by Tuesday. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great day.

Customer: Okay. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
