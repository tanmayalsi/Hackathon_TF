Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got work I need to do and I'm pretty frustrated right now.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm sorry you're experiencing that. Let me help you get this resolved. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here... and I've got you as... is this Mark?

Customer: Yes, Mark Johnson.

Agent: Perfect, Mark. Thank you. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Just to confirm, you're not seeing any lights on your modem right now, correct?

Customer: Well, actually, I see some lights. There's a green light on the front, but nothing's connecting. Like, my WiFi isn't showing up at all, and when I try to plug in ethernet, nothing happens either.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So the modem itself seems to have power, which is good. Let's try a few things here. First, can you unplug the modem from the power outlet for me? Just... completely unplug it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, doing that now... it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we wait, I'm also seeing here that there was actually a service disruption in your area earlier this afternoon. It was only about fifteen minutes, but let me check the current status... (typing sounds) Looks like service has been restored as of about twenty minutes ago.

Customer: Oh really? Well, that might be when it happened then, because it was working fine this morning and then around two o'clock I just... nothing.

Agent: Right, so the timing does match up. Here's what I want you to do—go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Yeah, it's plugged back in. The lights are coming back on... there's the green light again and... oh, I see an orange light blinking now too.

Agent: Perfect. The orange light means it's syncing up. That should go away in just a moment. Give it about thirty seconds or so.

Customer: (pause) Alright, waiting... (pause) Still orange. Still blinking.

Agent: That's normal. It can take a minute sometimes. While we're waiting, let me just verify—you have the newer model modem, right? The one with the white casing?

Customer: Uh, I think so? It's kind of a cream colored box... is that the newer one?

Agent: That sounds right. Okay. Do you see any lights turning green now, or any other changes?

Customer: (pause) Umm... now I'm seeing green, orange, and there's like a... red light? I don't know, there's definitely a red light in there now.

Agent: (pause) Red light, okay. That's... that's not typical. Did you recently move the modem or change anything with the setup?

Customer: No, no, everything's been the same. It was just working this morning and then out of nowhere...

Agent: Right, I understand. Let me just check something on my end here. (typing sounds, longer pause) Mark, I'm going to have you try something else. Can you locate the reset button on the modem? It's usually a small button you have to hold down...

Customer: Reset button... yeah, I see it. It's like recessed in the back here.

Agent: Correct. Okay, I want you to hold that down for about ten seconds. This will reset the modem to factory settings, so it might take a couple minutes to fully come back online.

Customer: Okay, holding it... (pause) ...ten seconds... and releasing. The lights are going crazy now. Is that supposed to happen?

Agent: (pause) Yeah, they should cycle through while it's resetting. That's... that's totally normal. Go ahead and give it a few minutes and let me know when you see the lights stabilize.

Customer: (pause) Okay... it's been like a minute now and there's still a lot of blinking happening. Orange, green, orange, green...

Agent: Uh-huh. That should settle down shortly. While we're waiting, have you noticed any issues with your modem or connection before this happened? Any outages or problems in the last few weeks?

Customer: No, honestly, it's been pretty reliable. This is the first time something like this has happened since we got Frontier like... six months ago?

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. (pause) So what are you seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Um... it's mostly green now, but there's still like a little red blinking in there.

Agent: (pause) Still red? Okay... (typing sounds) Let me check your account to see if there's anything else going on. Can you try connecting to WiFi now? Does the network name show up at all?

Customer: Let me grab my phone... (pause) No, I don't see any network. Nothing's showing up. Usually it says "Frontier-XXXX" or whatever, and there's nothing there.

Agent: (pause, typing) Hmm. Okay, and the ethernet cable—is that connected directly from the modem to your computer?

Customer: Yeah, it should be. Well, let me check... (pause) Yeah, I plugged it in.

Agent: And you're not getting any connection through that either?

Customer: No, nothing. It's like the modem is on but it's not actually... connecting to anything, you know?

Agent: Right, I hear you. (pause) I'm looking at your account history and the modem should be fully provisioned. Let me try one more thing here. I'm going to send a signal to the modem on my end to restart the connection. Give it about a minute after I do that.

Customer: Okay, whenever you're ready.

Agent: (pause, typing) Alright, signal sent. Let's wait just a moment here... (pause) What are you seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Um... same thing. Red light's still blinking, no networks showing up, and the ethernet still doesn't work.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, okay. That's... that's frustrating. Let me be honest with you, Mark. Based on what we're seeing, this sounds like it might be a modem hardware issue. The fact that the reset didn't resolve it and the red light is still showing—that usually indicates a problem with the device itself rather than a connectivity issue on our end.

Customer: You're kidding me. So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, what I'd like to do is dispatch a technician to your location to either repair or replace the modem. Now, since you're still within your service period, there shouldn't be a charge for this visit.

Customer: How long is that going to take? I really need the internet working today if possible.

Agent: (pause, typing) Let me check availability in your area... I'm looking at tomorrow actually. Would you be available for a window between 9 AM and 5 PM?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't they come out today?

Agent: Unfortunately, looking at today's schedule, all our technicians in your area are booked up. But tomorrow should be our first available slot. I can put you down for that if you'd like.

Customer: (pause, sighs) Yeah, okay, I guess I don't have much choice. Tomorrow's fine, as long as someone actually shows up.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Mark. I'll get you scheduled for tomorrow. Can I get a callback number to confirm the appointment?

Customer: It's the same number the account's under—555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. So just to confirm everything—we have you scheduled for a technician visit tomorrow, anytime between 9 AM and 5 PM, to repair or replace your modem. You should receive a confirmation text or email shortly, and we'll also call to confirm an hour before the technician arrives.

Customer: Alright. I guess that's it then?

Agent: Yes, that should be all for now. Again, I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone, but I'm confident our technician will get you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's everything.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer, Mark, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. You should be all set. Have a good day.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
