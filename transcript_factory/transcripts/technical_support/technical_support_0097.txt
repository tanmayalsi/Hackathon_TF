# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And is this under the name Michael?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing no internet connection at all right now?

Customer: No, nothing. The modem's been blinking red all morning. I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, but that didn't help.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting on your part. A red light usually indicates a connection issue. Let me just verify a few things. Do you have power to the modem?

Customer: Yeah, it's definitely powered on. The lights are on, just... red.

Agent: Got it. And just to confirm, you're not seeing any green or blue lights at all?

Customer: No, just red. And, um, one of them's blinking I think? Or they all are, I'm not really sure...

Agent: That's okay. Let's try a full reset of the modem. Can you locate the reset button? It's usually a small button on the back of the device.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I'm looking... I think I see it. It's like, really small, right?

Agent: Yes, exactly. You might need a paperclip or a pen to press it. Go ahead and hold that for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (sounds of searching, slight rustling) Okay, I'm using a pen... holding it now. (pause) How long should I wait?

Agent: Just about 10 more seconds... you can release it now. Give it a minute or two to boot back up, and we'll see if that helps.

Customer: (pause) Okay... still red though.

Agent: Hmm, it should take about a minute or two to fully restart. Let's give it another moment. While we wait, I'm going to check if there are any service outages in your area. (typing sounds) What's your service address?

Customer: 847 Maple Street. That's in the 94043 zip code.

Agent: (typing) 847 Maple Street, 94043. Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area right now, which is good news and bad news, I guess.

Customer: (slight laugh) Yeah, so... what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it means the problem is likely specific to your equipment or your line. Have you noticed any weather issues or recent power outages at your place?

Customer: No, it's been pretty nice today actually. But now that you mention it, we did have a storm come through yesterday evening. Pretty bad one too.

Agent: Ah, okay. That could definitely be a factor. Lightning can sometimes affect the equipment or the line itself. Is the modem still showing red?

Customer: Yeah, it is. (pause) Is the internet supposed to be back on by now?

Agent: It should be, yes. Let me try a different approach. Can you tell me what kind of modem you have? It should say on the sticker on the back or the bottom.

Customer: Um... (rustling sounds) It says... Frontier... FX-7623?

Agent: (typing) Okay, the FX-7623. And just to be thorough, do you see any cables that look loose or disconnected? The coaxial cable coming from the wall?

Customer: (pause) Let me check... no, it looks pretty snug to me.

Agent: Alright. Let me try running a line test from our end. (typing sounds, pause) I'm sending a signal down your line now. Can you let me know if anything changes on the modem display?

Customer: (pause) No... nothing. Still just red. (pause) How much longer do you think this will take? I have to work from home today.

Agent: I understand. Let me be honest with you—we've tried the standard troubleshooting steps here, and the modem isn't responding as it should. I'm showing that the signal coming into your location is weak, which could be from that storm you mentioned, or it could be a damaged line somewhere.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, here's what we can do. I can schedule a technician to come out and physically inspect your equipment and the line. They'll be able to determine if something's damaged and repair it on the spot.

Customer: How soon can someone come out?

Agent: (typing) Let me check our availability... The earliest we have is tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need it today...

Agent: I completely understand, and I wish I had something sooner. We do have emergency same-day service, but there would be an additional $99 fee for that. Otherwise, tomorrow morning is our next available window.

Customer: (pause) That's... yeah, that's not ideal. Can I just try one more thing? Is there anything else I haven't tried?

Agent: (pause) Well, you could try a different coaxial cable if you have one available. But honestly, with that weak signal reading, it's most likely going to require a technician visit anyway.

Customer: I don't think I have another one lying around...

Agent: Yeah, that's pretty typical. I think at this point, your best option is to go with the technician visit tomorrow. I can also waive the service call fee since we couldn't resolve this over the phone. That's a $49 value.

Customer: Oh, okay... that's something at least. So, tomorrow morning?

Agent: Yes. I'm going to send you a confirmation email right now with a link to track the technician. You'll also get a text message an hour before they arrive. The window is 8 AM to noon. Is that the email we have on file?

Customer: (pause) Um, it should be... what's the email you have?

Agent: It looks like we have michael.torres@email.com.

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. You should get that confirmation in the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you about the appointment?

Customer: No, I think... I mean, I really wish we could've fixed it today, but I guess tomorrow will have to work. Thank you for trying at least.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved right away. Our technician will get you back online tomorrow, and they'll get to the bottom of what's happening. We really do appreciate your patience, Michael.

Customer: Alright, well... I guess I'll talk to you later. Or not talk to you, hopefully.

Agent: (slight laugh) Understood. You have a good rest of your day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
