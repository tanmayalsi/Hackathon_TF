Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of. Nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got you here. So your internet is completely down right now? Are you seeing any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Um, let me look... Yeah, the modem has some lights on it. There's a green light, I think, and then... yeah, there's a red light that keeps blinking.

Agent: Okay, that red blinking light typically indicates there's no signal reaching your modem. That's helpful information. Let me ask you a few questions. Have you had any storms in your area recently, or any construction work happening nearby?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine this morning and then just... stopped.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm, have you tried unplugging the modem and waiting a few minutes before plugging it back in?

Customer: (pause) No, actually, I haven't tried that yet. Let me do that right now.

Agent: Sure thing. Go ahead and unplug it, and we'll give it about thirty seconds to a minute, then plug it back in.

Customer: (background noise of movement, then waiting) Okay, I'm plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. While that's starting back up, let me pull up your service history here. (typing sounds) I'm just going to check if there are any outages in your area...

Customer: Okay. So how long should I wait?

Agent: Give it about two minutes to fully boot up. You should start seeing lights come on, and hopefully that red light will go away. Let me just check on those outages... (pause) I'm not showing any reported outages on our end in your area, so that's good news.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... the lights are back on now. There's still a red blinking light though.

Agent: Hmm, that's not ideal. Let me have you try a different approach. Can you check the cable connection where it goes into the back of the modem? Sometimes these connections can get a little loose.

Customer: (background noise) Let me see... (pause) ...no, it looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Okay, and is the cable coming from the wall? Like, where's that connection point?

Customer: It's coming from the wall, yeah. And that looks... that seems secure too.

Agent: Alright. Well, let me try accessing your modem remotely to see if I can get any diagnostic information. Can you tell me what model modem you have? It should be on a sticker on the box.

Customer: (pause) Um, let me find that... It says "Frontier G2420" or something like that.

Agent: G2420, okay. Perfect. I'm pulling that up now. (typing sounds) And just so you know, I won't be changing any of your settings, just looking at what's happening on our end.

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your modem's status page... and I'm seeing that the connection status says "No Signal" on the line. This typically means either there's an issue with the line coming from the street, or there's an issue with the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, let me try one more thing before we go down that road. Can you look at the back of the modem and tell me if you see any other cables plugged in besides the one from the wall?

Customer: (background noise) Let me look... no, just the one from the wall and the power cable.

Agent: Okay, that's what we want to see. Let me try resetting the modem completely. I'm going to walk you through a factory reset. Can you locate the reset button? It's usually a small button on the back of the unit.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's like a tiny little button, right?

Agent: That's the one. Okay, I need you to hold it down for about fifteen seconds while the modem is powered on. Ready?

Customer: Ready. (pause, background noise) Okay, I'm holding it... how long was that?

Agent: Just a few more seconds... and go ahead and let it go.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's done.

Agent: Perfect. Now we're going to give it a full three minutes to restart. This should reset everything back to factory defaults. While we wait, can you tell me—have you noticed anything unusual with the modem recently? Any odd sounds or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing weird. It's been working great until today.

Agent: Okay, well, that's good at least. (pause, typing sounds) What's your internet usually used for? Like, do you have multiple devices connected?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my laptop, my wife's laptop, and we have a streaming device. Pretty standard stuff.

Agent: Alright, and do you remember if you had any power outages or anything last night?

Customer: I don't think so... I mean, the cable box and everything else is working fine, so I don't think there was an outage.

Agent: Right, that's a good point. Okay... the modem should be coming back online now. Are you seeing any lights?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the lights are on again, but... that red light is back. Still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so the reset didn't clear it up. David, at this point, I'm pretty confident the issue is either with the line coming into your home from our network, or there's a hardware failure with the modem itself. Unfortunately, I'm not able to completely troubleshoot this over the phone.

Customer: So what does that mean? Am I without internet for a while?

Agent: Well, I'd like to schedule a technician to come out to your location. They can test the line and check the modem in person. Let me see what we have available... (typing sounds) How does Thursday between 9 AM and 1 PM look for you?

Customer: (pause) Thursday is... yeah, I guess that works, but... is there really nothing else we can try right now?

Agent: I understand it's frustrating. (pause) Let me try one more thing. Can you check if the power cable is all the way plugged into the modem and the outlet? Sometimes these things can be finicky.

Customer: (background noise) I just checked. Yeah, it looks like it's all plugged in.

Agent: Okay, and that red light is still blinking steadily?

Customer: Yeah, same thing.

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, at this point, I think we've exhausted what I can do from here. The technician visit is really going to be your best bet. They'll be able to [inaudible] the line from the street and test everything.

Customer: Alright... I guess Thursday works then.

Agent: Great. Let me get some information for that appointment. What's the best phone number to reach you at?

Customer: 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, that's the same number on the account. And what's the address?

Customer: 2847 Maple Street, apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so I have you down for Thursday, 9 AM to 1 PM, at 2847 Maple Street, apartment 3B. The technician will call you before arriving. Your appointment confirmation number is 784521.

Customer: Got it. Is there anything I should do in the meantime?

Agent: Just leave the modem plugged in so the technician can see what we're seeing. Don't worry about trying anything else. And if you see anything change before Thursday, just give us a call back and let us know.

Customer: Okay, sounds good.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online today, David. I know this is frustrating. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you Thursday. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
