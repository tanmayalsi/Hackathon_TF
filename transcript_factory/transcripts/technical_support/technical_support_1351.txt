Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got my laptop here and nothing's connecting.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Okay, I've got you here. I can see you're on our fiber service in the Riverside area. And you're saying your internet went down about an hour ago?

Customer: Yeah, roughly an hour. One minute it was working fine and then just... nothing. No lights on the modem, nothing.

Agent: Alright, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what you're seeing on your modem right now? Are there any lights on it at all?

Customer: Um, no. That's the thing. It's completely dark. Not a single light.

Agent: Okay, no lights at all. That usually means there's a power issue. Let me ask you—is the modem plugged in? I know it sounds obvious, but...

Customer: (chuckles) Yeah, I checked that already. It's plugged in. I actually tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, and still nothing.

Agent: Good thinking. You're ahead of the game. Can you check if the power cable is fully inserted into the back of the modem? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me... yeah, it's in there pretty tight actually.

Agent: Alright. And you're using the power adapter that came with the modem, correct? Not like a different charger?

Customer: Yeah, it's the original one that came with it.

Agent: Good. Um, this might sound weird, but can you try a different outlet? Like, plug the modem into a different outlet in your home?

Customer: Oh, that's actually a good idea. Hold on. (pause) Let me unplug it and... (pause) okay, I'm plugging it in over here... (pause) Nope. Still nothing.

Agent: Hmm, that's... okay. How long have you had this modem with us?

Customer: I'd say probably about two years? Maybe a little longer.

Agent: Okay, so it's not brand new. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) Is there any chance there was a storm in your area recently? Sometimes that can cause damage to equipment.

Customer: No, not that I'm aware of. It's been clear all day. Actually, the weather's been pretty good all week.

Agent: Alright, well, I'm just... I'm trying to figure out what might've caused this. Let me try a different approach. Can you see your ONT unit? That's the box that connects outside, usually mounted on your wall?

Customer: The ONT? I think I know what you're talking about. Yeah, it's mounted out by the front of the house. Hold on, let me go check it.

Agent: Yeah, that would be great.

Customer: (sound of footsteps, door opening) Okay, I'm looking at it. It's got a couple lights on it—there's a green light and... yeah, a green light and a red light, I think?

Agent: Okay, so you are getting some activity. That's good. Which light is red and which is green?

Customer: Um, the green light is on the left, and the red one is... the red one's kind of in the middle-ish area.

Agent: Alright, and is the red light steady or is it blinking?

Customer: It's steady. Just sitting there.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that red light actually... that's a warning indicator. That usually means there's a connection issue on our end or possibly a fiber line problem. But the good news is the unit is getting power. Let me check our systems here to see if there's an outage in your area. (typing sounds) Give me just one second...

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) I'm not seeing a widespread outage reported, but that doesn't mean there isn't a localized issue. The red light on the ONT is definitely telling me something's not right with the signal coming into your house.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is that something you can fix?

Agent: Well, ideally yes, but... let me try one more thing first. Can you go back inside and make sure the modem is connected to the ONT? There should be an ethernet cable that goes from the ONT to the modem.

Customer: (sound of footsteps) Okay, I'm back inside. Yeah, I can see... I'm looking behind the modem. There's a cable going into it, yeah.

Agent: Can you check if it's firmly seated in both ends? Like, give it a gentle tug to make sure it's not loose?

Customer: (pause) Okay, trying... it seems pretty solid. It's not coming out or anything.

Agent: Alright. And the other end is connected to the ONT, right?

Customer: I'd have to go back out and check, but I'm pretty sure it is. It's been like that since they installed it.

Agent: Yeah, usually once it's set up, you don't need to mess with it. But let me... actually, you know what? Let me try to see if I can send a restart command from our end to your equipment. That might help reset the connection. Can you stay on the line?

Customer: Yeah, sure, I can do that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm sending that command now. It might take a couple minutes to process. While we wait, let me ask—have you seen any other issues with your service recently? Anything unusual?

Customer: No, not really. It's been pretty consistent until today.

Agent: (pause) Okay, and you didn't see any kind of warning messages or anything before it went out?

Customer: Nope. Just suddenly dropped.

Agent: Alright, the command went through. It should take about... (pause) ...let me give it about thirty seconds to a minute. Can you go check the ONT again and see if that red light is still there?

Customer: Okay, heading back out. (sound of footsteps, door opening) Looking at it now... (pause) ...yeah, the red light's still there. Maybe a little less bright? I'm not sure.

Agent: Hmm, it might be processing. Let's give it another minute.

Customer: (pause) Okay, still just the red light though.

Agent: Yeah, I was hoping that would clear it up, but it doesn't seem to have done the trick. I think what we might be dealing with here is either a fiber line issue or possibly a hardware failure on the ONT itself. At this point, I think we're going to need to get a technician out to your location to physically inspect the equipment and the line.

Customer: A technician? How long would that take? I really need my internet back.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds) Okay, so looking at our schedule... the earliest I can get someone out to you would be... it looks like tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? I mean, I guess it has to. Is there really nothing else we can try right now?

Agent: I wish there was, believe me. But with that red light on the ONT and no power to the modem after trying all of our basic troubleshooting, it really does seem like a hardware or line issue that's going to need hands-on work. The technician will be able to check everything properly.

Customer: (sighs) Alright, well, I guess I don't have much choice. Go ahead and schedule it.

Agent: Absolutely. So I've got you down for tomorrow, the 15th, between 8 and noon. You should get a confirmation text at the number on file, and the technician will have your account information. Is there a gate code or anything I should note on this appointment?

Customer: No, no gate code. It's an open driveway.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm the address... it's 447 Elm Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's it.

Agent: Great. I really am sorry about this. I know this is frustrating. The technician should be able to get you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll just have to wait until tomorrow, I guess.

Agent: I do apologize. Thank you for being patient with us and for working through all those troubleshooting steps. You did everything right. We'll get this fixed for you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
