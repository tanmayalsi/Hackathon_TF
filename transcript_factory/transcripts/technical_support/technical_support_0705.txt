Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got work stuff I need to do and this is really frustrating.

Agent: I understand, and I'm sorry you're experiencing that. I'll definitely do my best to help get you back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... uh... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's James. James Murphy.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got you here. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Just to confirm, you're not getting any connection at all right now, correct?

Customer: Right, nothing. The modem's on, I can see the lights and everything, but there's just no internet. I've tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, if that helps.

Agent: That actually does help—good thinking on that. Okay, so let me ask you a few quick questions. When you look at the modem, which lights are you seeing? Are they solid, blinking, any red lights?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...so the power light is solid green. The, uh... I think it says "online" or something is blinking orange. And there's another one that's... I don't know, also orange?

Agent: Okay, so we've got a solid green power light, which is good. But the orange blinking lights—those are typically indicating that the modem is having trouble connecting to our network. That could be a few different things. Let me just check our system here to see if there are any outages in your area.

Customer: Okay, yeah, do that.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported in your neighborhood. What I'd like to do is walk you through a few troubleshooting steps, okay?

Customer: Sure, yeah, whatever you need to do.

Agent: Great. First, can you locate where the cable comes into your modem? The coaxial cable—it's the thick one with the threaded connector.

Customer: Yeah, I can see it. It's right here.

Agent: Perfect. Can you just check to make sure it's hand-tight? Sometimes these can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it seems pretty tight. I'm not gonna... I mean, I don't wanna break it.

Agent: No, you won't break it—just make sure it's snug. Go ahead and give it a little clockwise turn if it moves at all.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I gave it a little turn. Um... (pause) ...nothing changed. Still the same orange lights.

Agent: Alright, no problem. Let's try a full power cycle. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet?

Customer: Yeah, unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. While we wait, let me ask—have you noticed any physical damage to the modem or any of the cables? Any wet spots or anything like that?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't think so. Everything looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay, good. That's good. Go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. (background noise of modem rebooting) The lights are... um... they're blinking a lot right now.

Agent: Yeah, that's normal. It should take about a minute or two to fully boot up. Let's give it a couple minutes and see if those lights stabilize.

Customer: (long pause) (typing sounds) Okay, still orange. Still not working.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, James, I'm gonna check something on my end. Can you hold for just one second?

Customer: Yeah, go ahead.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, I'm back. So I'm looking at your modem logs and I'm actually seeing some signal issues on our end. The signal levels coming into your modem are pretty low. That could indicate a problem with the line itself or possibly with the splitter if you have one.

Customer: A splitter? I don't... I'm not sure what that is.

Agent: It's basically a device that splits the cable signal if you have multiple things connected—like a TV and modem. Do you have cable TV service with us as well?

Customer: Oh, yeah, actually I do. But the TV's working fine.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. (pause) Can you describe to me where your modem is set up? Is it, um, connected directly to the wall or is it connected to any boxes or devices?

Customer: Uh, let me see... (pause) ...it's connected to a white box thing. I think that's the splitter you're talking about?

Agent: That could be, yeah. Okay, so here's what I'd like you to try. Can you disconnect the modem from that box and connect it directly to the wall outlet with the cable? Just to test it.

Customer: (pause) Uh... I mean, I can try, but I don't have a super long cable, so...

Agent: That's okay, even if it's just temporary for testing purposes. Go ahead and give that a shot.

Customer: (pause) (rustling sounds) Okay, so I've got it disconnected from the box now and... (pause) ...plugging it into the wall. (pause) Okay, it's in. (pause) Still the same thing. Orange lights, still not connecting.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Okay, I'm thinking we might have a larger issue here on the line side. Before we go any further, I do want to check—when was the last time you had service with no problems?

Customer: Um... yesterday morning. Everything was working fine yesterday.

Agent: And did anything change? Like, did you have anyone at your house? Any storms in the area? Anything out of the ordinary?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just fine yesterday and then this morning, boom, nothing.

Agent: (pause) Okay, James, I'm gonna be honest with you—based on what I'm seeing and what we're getting from the modem, this looks like it might be an issue with the line coming into your house or potentially with the equipment at our end. I don't think this is something we can resolve with troubleshooting over the phone.

Customer: Oh man... so what does that mean?

Agent: What that means is we're gonna need to get a technician out to your place to physically inspect the line and the connection. They'll be able to run proper tests and see what's actually causing the problem.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so the earliest I can get someone to you would be... tomorrow between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I don't have much choice, right?

Agent: I understand your frustration. I wish I could get this resolved today for you. But tomorrow morning is pretty quick for a tech visit. Does that time window work?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, fine. Tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just confirm all your information. Your name is James Murphy, phone number 555-0147, and we've got your address on file as 447 Maple Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just so you know, the technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive, just to confirm. The service call itself shouldn't take more than an hour or so, depending on what they find.

Customer: Okay. And in the meantime, there's nothing else I can do?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. But I do want you to know you can call us back if something changes or if you have any other questions. The confirmation will also be sent to the email on your account.

Customer: [inaudible] ...okay. Yeah, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, James. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved tonight, but I'm confident our tech will take great care of you tomorrow morning. Is there anything else I can help with?

Customer: No, that's... that's everything. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: My pleasure. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow!

Customer: Yep, bye.

Agent: Bye, James!
