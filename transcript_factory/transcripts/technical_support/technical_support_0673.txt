Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out completely about an hour ago and I can't get it back up.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm showing an account for David Chen at 2847 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, David. So your internet is completely down right now. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router, or are they completely dark?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) Okay, so the modem has a couple lights on it. There's like a green light and then a red light that keeps blinking.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So we've got a green light and a red blinking light. The red blinking light typically indicates there's a connectivity issue. Let's try a couple things here. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out completely.

Customer: Yeah, one second. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. While that's unplugging, let me ask—have you made any changes to your setup recently? New router, any work done on your lines, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. It was working fine this morning and then around noon it just... stopped.

Agent: Alright, let's give it about thirty seconds while it's unplugged. (pause) Have you rebooted it before today or is this the first time you're trying?

Customer: I tried unplugging it once already, like twenty minutes ago, and it came back for maybe two minutes and then died again.

Agent: Okay, so it did come back briefly. That's actually... that's good information. Go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, it's back in. The lights are... they're coming on. Green light's on, and now... yeah, the red light is blinking again.

Agent: Yeah, so we're seeing the same pattern. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) So I'm not showing any outages in your area currently, which is good news. But I am going to need to look a little deeper. Can you check something for me? Is your modem plugged directly into the wall outlet, or is it on a power strip?

Customer: It's on a power strip, yeah.

Agent: Try unplugging it from the power strip and plug it directly into a wall outlet instead. Sometimes power strips can cause issues.

Customer: (pause) Okay, trying that now. (pause) Plugging it in... and the lights are... they're doing the same thing. Green and then red blinking.

Agent: Alright, I see. Let me also ask about your router. Do you have a separate router, or are you using a modem/router combo?

Customer: I have a separate router, yeah. It's connected by an ethernet cable to the modem.

Agent: Okay, and what lights are you seeing on the router?

Customer: Uh... (pause) I don't see any lights on it at all, actually. It's completely dark.

Agent: That could be part of the issue. Try unplugging the router and plug it back in. Give it about a minute to fully boot up.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Waiting... (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Still nothing. No lights at all.

Agent: Hmm, that's concerning. The router should at least have a power light. Can you check if the power cable is securely connected to the back of the router?

Customer: Let me see... (pause) Yeah, it feels pretty secure to me. It's... it's definitely plugged in.

Agent: Okay. And the cable that goes from the modem to the router—can you check that that's firmly seated in the ports on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, both ends look tight to me. (pause) Still no lights on the router though.

Agent: Alright, David. I'm going to be honest with you—it sounds like we might have a couple of issues here. The red blinking light on the modem is indicating that there's no signal coming through on our end, and the fact that your router won't power on is also concerning. Let me try to see if I can send a signal to your modem from here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm sending a test signal... and... no, I'm not getting any response.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it something on my end or something on yours?

Agent: Well, it could be either. The unresponsive router is definitely a device issue on your end—that might need to be replaced or serviced. But the modem issue could be on our end with the signal, or it could also be the device. Tell you what, let me try one more thing. Can you check the cable that comes into your house from outside? The one that connects to the modem? Do you know where that is?

Customer: Um... I think it's... let me look around. (pause) Is it the black cable that comes through the wall?

Agent: Yes, exactly. The black coaxial cable. Can you make sure it's tightly screwed onto the modem?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it now. Let me check how tight it is. (pause) It feels pretty tight, but let me try tightening it a little more with my hand... (pause) Yeah, that's about as tight as I can get it. Does that help?

Agent: Let's see. (pause) Unfortunately, I'm still not detecting any signal coming through. David, at this point, I think we need to schedule a technician visit. There's definitely something going on with either the line coming in or the modem itself, and without being able to get a signal, I can't troubleshoot further remotely.

Customer: Oh man, really? How long before someone can come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) The earliest I can get someone out to you would be... tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have an afternoon slot on Friday between 1 and 5 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning works. Can they call me before they come?

Agent: Absolutely. They'll typically call about thirty minutes before they arrive. I'm going to schedule that for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you down for tomorrow morning, between 8 and 12. Your confirmation number is 7823491. Is there a number they should call to confirm?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Perfect. I've got that noted. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying.

Agent: You're welcome, David. I apologize that we couldn't get it working over the phone. Our technician will take good care of you tomorrow. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
