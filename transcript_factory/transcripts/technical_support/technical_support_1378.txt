# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I work from home and I've got calls scheduled this afternoon.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. And your name is... Michael Chen?

Customer: That's right, yeah.

Agent: Great, Michael. So your internet went down this morning? Can you tell me a little bit more about what happened? Did you notice anything unusual before it stopped working?

Customer: Um, not really. I was working at my desk and I just... I went to load a page and nothing happened. It just... nothing. And I checked my modem and router and... I don't know, they look fine to me. The lights are on and stuff.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Let me ask you a few things. Are the lights on your modem blinking at all, or are they solid?

Customer: Uh... (pause) they're blinking. Most of them anyway. There's like a red one on there though, which seems... bad?

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing a red light. That could definitely be an issue. Can you tell me which light is red? Is it near the top, bottom...?

Customer: It's... it's the one that says, um... I'm looking at it now... it says "online" or something like that?

Agent: The online indicator light is red. That's actually really helpful information. That usually means we're not getting a strong connection signal from our network. Let me try something here. I'm going to send a signal to your modem from my end. Give me just one second...

(pause, typing sounds)

Agent: Okay, I've sent that through. Can you take a look at your modem again and tell me if anything's changed?

Customer: (pause) No, uh... still red. Still blinking.

Agent: Alright. Let's try doing a hard reset on the modem. What I'd like you to do is unplug it from the power source, and then wait about 30 seconds.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now.

(pause - approximately 30 seconds of silence)

Customer: Alright, it's been about 30 seconds.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: Plugging it back in now... (pause) ...okay, it's booting up.

Agent: Perfect. We usually give it about two to three minutes to fully boot up and connect to our network. Why don't we wait a minute or so and then you can check that light again?

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I'll wait...

(pause of approximately one minute, background noise of the customer's environment)

Customer: Alright, so it's been a minute. Let me look... (pause) ...no, that red light is still there, man. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand, Michael. I know that's frustrating. Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm going to look at your service line to see if there's anything... (pause) ...okay, interesting. I'm actually not showing a connection from your home unit to our network right now.

Customer: What does that mean? Like, is it broken or something?

Agent: Not necessarily. It could be a few different things. Let me ask you this—is there a coaxial cable? It looks like a thick cable, kind of silvery, that connects to the back of your modem?

Customer: Um, yeah, I see it. It's connected.

Agent: Can you check if it's tight? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) It... seems pretty tight to me. Let me see if I can... (grunt) ...no, it's not moving. It's definitely in there.

Agent: Okay, good. Um, let me try something else. Can you unplug the modem one more time, but this time also unplug your router?

Customer: Both of them?

Agent: Yes, both of them. Unplug them and wait about two minutes this time. Let's do a complete reset.

Customer: Okay, okay, unplugging now. (pause) Both are unplugged. I'll wait...

(pause of approximately two minutes, ambient background noise)

Customer: Alright, it's been a couple minutes.

Agent: Go ahead and plug the modem back in first, and then wait for it to fully boot up before you plug in the router.

Customer: Plugging the modem back in... (pause) ...okay. How long should I wait?

Agent: Let's give it about three minutes this time. The lights should go through a few cycles and then stabilize.

(pause of approximately three minutes)

Customer: Alright, it's been three minutes now. Um... (pause) ...the online light is... it's still red, Derek. And it's still blinking.

Agent: (long pause) Okay, that's... that's not ideal. Let me check a few things here. (typing sounds, pause) Michael, I'm not picking up any signal on our end. Let me ask you—have there been any recent storms or anything like that in your area? Sometimes weather can affect the line coming into your home.

Customer: Um, no, it's been fine. Clear skies all morning. And like, my neighbor has Frontier too, I think, and his internet seems to be working fine.

Agent: Okay, so it seems pretty localized to your connection. Let me... (pause) ...I'm going to be honest with you, at this point it sounds like there might be an issue with either the line coming to your house or possibly with the modem itself. I've done what I can do remotely.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long is this going to take to fix?

Agent: Well, what I'm going to need to do is get a technician out to your location to physically check the line and your equipment. Let me see what availability we have...

(typing sounds, pause)

Agent: I can get someone out there tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or if that doesn't work, we have Thursday afternoon from 1 to 5 PM. Do either of those windows work for you?

Customer: (frustrated) Tomorrow? I need it working today. I have conference calls at 2 PM.

Agent: I completely understand, and I really wish I could get someone out sooner. Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day appointments available. I apologize for that. But if you can do tomorrow morning, that might be your best bet to get this resolved quickly.

Customer: (sighs) I guess tomorrow morning. 8 to 12. Can I get a reference number or something?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that set up for you right now. (typing sounds) Your service appointment confirmation number is 847-5923. You'll get a text and email confirmation shortly. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I... I guess I'll just have to use my cell phone hotspot for now. This really isn't ideal.

Agent: I understand, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. The technician tomorrow should be able to get to the bottom of this for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we'll get this sorted out for you tomorrow.
