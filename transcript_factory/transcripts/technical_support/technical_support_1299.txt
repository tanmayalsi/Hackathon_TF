Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, uh, my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back up. I've been without it for like two hours now and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I see you're in the Riverside area. And you're saying your internet went down this morning around...?

Customer: Yeah, around 8:30 or so. One minute it was working fine, the next it just... died. No warning or anything.

Agent: Alright. Well, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, I want you to look at your modem. Do you see any lights on it right now?

Customer: Um, let me see. (pause) Yeah, there's... there's a red light. It's just solid red on the front.

Agent: Okay, a solid red light. That usually means there's a connection issue on our end. But let's rule out some other possibilities first. Can you see the power cable is securely connected to the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, yeah it's plugged in. The cable's definitely connected.

Agent: Good. And what about the line coming from the wall? Is that firmly seated in the back of the modem?

Customer: Uh-huh, looks solid to me.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so here's what I want you to do. I'm going to have you do a hard reboot on the modem. Go ahead and unplug it completely for about thirty seconds.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now while that's sitting, let me ask you — have you had any storms in your area recently? Or any construction work or anything like that?

Customer: No, no storms. The weather's been pretty clear all week. Why, did something go down?

Agent: No, nothing like that. Just making sure there wasn't any external cause. Go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Alright, it's back in and... (pause) still red. The light's still red.

Agent: Still red. Okay. (typing sounds) Let me check our systems on this end. Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm not seeing any active outages reported in your area. But I am seeing that your modem hasn't been communicating with our network since about 8:27 this morning, so you're right on the timeline.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is there something wrong with the modem?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. The modem itself might be failing, or there could be an issue with the line coming into your house. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem again, but this time leave it unplugged for a full minute?

Customer: A whole minute? Okay... (long pause) I'm counting down here. (pause) Alright, thirty more seconds... (pause) Okay, it's been about a minute.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: Plugging it back in now. (pause) Come on, modem... (pause) Okay, it's back in and I'm waiting for the lights to come up and... (pause) ...nope. Still red. Just the red light, nothing else.

Agent: Still just the red? Not even any amber or green indicators coming on?

Customer: Nope. Just red and it's not even blinking. It's just solid.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Okay, I want to try something else. Do you happen to have another coaxial cable around your house? Maybe one that came with the modem or that you had lying around?

Customer: A coax cable? Um... (pause) I might have one in the closet. Why, do you think the cable's bad?

Agent: It's possible. Sometimes they can go bad or get damaged. If you have one, we could swap it out and see if that helps.

Customer: Alright, let me go look. (pause) Okay, yeah, I found one. I'm back here at the modem.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and unplug the cable that's currently connected and replace it with the other one.

Customer: (sounds of disconnecting) Okay, disconnecting the old one... (pause) ...and connecting the new one. (pause) Alright, it's in.

Agent: Okay. Now unplug the modem again and wait about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright, unplugging... (pause) ...okay, thirty seconds... (pause) Plugging it back in.

(pause)

Customer: (sighing) Still red. I... I don't understand. Why isn't this working?

Agent: I understand your frustration. This is definitely unusual. At this point, I'm thinking there might be a line issue coming from outside your house. Hang tight, let me check your account to see if we can schedule a technician out there.

Customer: A technician? How long would that take? I really need my internet working. I have work I need to do from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) So we do have availability, but the earliest I can get someone out there would be tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't anyone come out today?

Agent: Unfortunately, our technicians are fully booked for today. I'm really sorry about that. But tomorrow is the soonest we can get someone there to check the line.

Customer: (frustrated) I mean, I guess I don't have much choice. Yeah, okay, tomorrow between 1 and 5.

Agent: Excellent. Let me get that scheduled for you. I'll make a note on your account that your modem is showing a solid red light and not communicating with the network. The technician will see that when they arrive.

Customer: Alright.

Agent: Your service call is confirmed for tomorrow between 1 PM and 5 PM. You should get a confirmation text at [inaudible] the number on file. Is that still 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, there's no charge for this service call since we haven't been able to resolve this over the phone. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess not. I just... I really need this fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm confident our technician will be able to get to the bottom of this. We really appreciate your patience, and I'm sorry you've had to deal with this today.

Customer: Yeah, alright. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
