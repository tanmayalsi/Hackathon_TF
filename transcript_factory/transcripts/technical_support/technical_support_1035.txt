Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just stopped working like an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of. I'm pretty frustrated at this point.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Torres.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Alright, I've got you here. So you're saying your internet went down about an hour ago?

Customer: Yeah, and like I said, I've already tried unplugging the modem and the router and plugging them back in. I waited like five minutes, too.

Agent: Great, that's actually the first thing I was going to suggest. So you've already done that. Okay, so right now, when you look at your modem, what lights do you see? Are they lit up at all?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, so there's a power light that's on. It's green. But the internet light... I think it's supposed to be green too? It's like, orange right now. Or amber. Whatever you want to call it.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is green and the internet light is amber. That's actually helpful information. That usually means the modem is trying to connect to our network but it's having trouble establishing that connection. Have you had any issues with your service recently? Any outages or anything like that?

Customer: No, it was working fine this morning. I was streaming on it, you know, watching YouTube. Then around noon it just... stopped.

Agent: Alright. Let me check something on my end. (pause, typing sounds) So I'm not showing any outages in your area. Let me ask you this—do you have a gateway or is that modem and router separate devices?

Customer: They're separate. I've got the modem you guys gave me, and then I have my own router that's connected to it.

Agent: Okay, good. So let me have you try something. Can you unplug the modem again, but this time wait a full two minutes before plugging it back in? Sometimes it takes a little longer to reset.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I'm doing that now. I'm unplugging it. Okay. (sounds of movement) So I'll just... sit here for two minutes?

Agent: Yep, that's perfect. While we wait, let me ask—are there any lights on your router right now?

Customer: (pause) The power light is on, it's green. And there's like, a couple other lights but they're kind of dim. One of them's blinking slowly.

Agent: Okay, so it's on. That's good. (pause) Alright, whenever you're ready, go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: Okay. (sounds of plugging in) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about 30 seconds to boot back up. (pause) You should start to see the lights come back on the modem. The power light should definitely be solid green, and then after a minute or so, you should see the internet light turn green if the connection is re-establishing. Can you watch that for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm watching it. Okay, so the power light is definitely green again. And the internet light is... still amber. It's been like ten seconds and it's still amber. (pause) Still amber. (pause) It's been almost a minute now. Nope, still just amber.

Agent: Hmm, that's not what we want to see. Okay. Let me check a few things here. (typing sounds, pause) Michael, I'm looking at your modem signal levels and they're actually looking pretty normal on my end. Have you noticed any physical damage to any of your cables? Like, is anything disconnected or anything look loose?

Customer: (pause) I mean, not that I can see. I'm looking at the cables right now. Everything looks plugged in pretty good to me. Do you want me to like, reseat them or something?

Agent: Actually, yeah, that's a good idea. Can you unplug the cable that goes from the wall into the modem? Just the one from the wall. Hold on, let me just make sure I'm being clear—the coaxial cable. It's the thick cable with the connector on the end?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I see it. (pause) Okay, I'm unplugging it.

Agent: Good. Now I want you to look at the connector on the end of that cable. Does it look clean? Any kind of corrosion or anything?

Customer: (pause) Uh... no, it looks fine to me. Looks normal.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug it back in. Make sure it's snug.

Customer: (sounds of connection) Okay, it's back in. Pretty tight.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait another 30 seconds or so and see if that helped. (pause) Is the light still amber?

Customer: (pause) Yeah. Still amber. This is weird.

Agent: I know, it's frustrating. Okay, so let me try something else here. Can you do me a favor and power cycle the modem? So hold down the power button on the back for about ten seconds until it completely shuts down.

Customer: The power button on the back? (pause) Okay, I'm... I'm holding it down. (pause) Okay, it's off. All the lights are gone.

Agent: Perfect. Now wait about 30 seconds again and then press it back on.

Customer: (pause) Waiting... okay, pressing it back on now. (sounds of powering on) Alright, it's booting back up.

Agent: Good. Let's give it about a minute and a half to fully boot. (pause, background hold music briefly plays) And how's it looking?

Customer: (pause) Okay, the power light is green again. The internet light is... (pause) ...still amber. Still amber, man. This isn't working.

Agent: Yeah, I can see why that would be frustrating. Okay, I'm going to be honest with you, Michael—when the internet light stays amber after a full power cycle and we've checked the cables, that usually indicates an issue with the modem itself or possibly the line coming into your home. Let me check one more thing. (typing sounds, pause) Can you tell me... have you noticed any other issues? Like, is your phone service working okay?

Customer: Oh, actually, no. Now that you mention it, my phone's been... I don't know, crackling a little bit? I didn't really think about it until you asked.

Agent: Okay, so the phone line is also having issues. That tells me this might be a line-level problem. Let me look at your account here... (pause, typing sounds) Alright, so I'm showing some signal degradation on your line. That could be causing both the internet and phone issues.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: (pause) Well, so there are a couple of possibilities. It could be something on our end, or it could be something with the line coming into your house. Since it's affecting both services, I think we need to get a technician out to look at this. They'll be able to diagnose whether it's an external issue or a modem issue.

Customer: A technician? How long is that going to take? I need my internet working.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what I can get scheduled for you. (pause, typing sounds) The earliest I have available is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... (pause) I guess that'll have to work. I don't really have a choice.

Agent: I know it's not ideal. I'm sorry about that. Let me make sure I get all your information correct for the appointment. The address on file is still 447 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: And your phone number is 555-0147?

Customer: That's correct.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, Michael, I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, 8 to 12. A technician will come out and they'll check your modem and the line. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with or any questions you have?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm just hoping they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: Yeah, I hope so too. And I want to apologize for the inconvenience. We really appreciate your patience. You should receive a confirmation text at 555-0147 with the appointment details. If anything changes or you need to reschedule, just let me know.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications. We'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, bye.

Agent: Bye.
