Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've tried restarting the modem and router and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot that. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing a service address at 2847 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned you've already restarted your modem and router. Just to confirm, when you say it's down, you're not getting any internet connection at all, correct?

Customer: Right, nothing. I've got no lights on the modem. It's completely dark.

Agent: Okay, no lights on the modem. That could indicate a power issue or a service issue on our end. Let me ask you a few questions. Is the modem plugged in?

Customer: (slight pause) Yeah, of course it's plugged in. I mean, I checked and it's definitely plugged into the wall.

Agent: Got it. And the outlet itself—is it working? You could test it by plugging in something else, like a lamp or your phone charger, just to make sure the outlet has power.

Customer: (background noise of movement) Okay, hold on one second. (pause) Yeah, the outlet is working. I plugged in my phone charger and it's charging fine.

Agent: Good, so the outlet has power. Now, the cable going from the wall outlet to your modem—can you check that it's securely connected? Sometimes it can come loose.

Customer: (more background noise) Let me look... Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It looks pretty connected to me, but let me... (slight grunt) let me try pushing it in a bit more to make sure it's tight.

Agent: Perfect, go ahead and do that.

Customer: Okay, I did that. But um... still no lights. Nothing's changing.

Agent: Alright. Let me try powering it down completely and then back up. So what I'd like you to do is unplug the modem from the power outlet, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. Go ahead and do that now.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it. (pause) ...waiting. Thirty seconds, right?

Agent: That's right.

Customer: (pause, longer pause) Alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Just give it a moment to boot up. It should take about a minute or so. You should see some lights start to appear on the modem.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, I'm... I'm not seeing anything yet. How long does it usually take?

Agent: It can take up to about ninety seconds. Let's give it another minute or so.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it... still nothing. This is weird. It was working fine yesterday.

Agent: I understand. Let me check on our end to see if there are any service outages or issues in your area. (typing sounds, pause) Let me pull up your service details here. Okay, so I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area at the moment, which is good news and bad news. The good news is it's not a widespread issue. The bad news is it might be something specific to your connection.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it my equipment?

Agent: It could be a few things. Let me ask—do you have a backup power source you could try? Sometimes the power adapter itself can go bad.

Customer: Um, I don't think so. I mean, I have the original one that came with it.

Agent: Okay. Well, let's try a different approach. Can you locate the reset button on your modem? It's usually a small button, sometimes recessed, that you'd need to hold down with a paperclip or something thin.

Customer: (pause, background noise) I'm looking at the back of it... Yeah, I see it. There's a small button here. Do I need to do anything with it?

Agent: Hold off on that for just a second. Before we do a factory reset, let me... actually, can you just describe what model modem you have? There should be a label on the device.

Customer: (pause) It says... um... Frontier... G1100. Is that what you need?

Agent: Yes, perfect. Okay, so the G1100—and I want to double-check something. Are you looking at the power light specifically? There should be a light on the front that indicates power.

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at the front. Definitely no lights at all.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. It's possible the modem's power supply has failed. These things don't happen often, but it does happen. Let me check on your account here. (typing sounds) Let me see what options we have. (pause) Have you had any recent storms or power surges in your area?

Customer: No, not that I know of. The weather's been fine.

Agent: Alright. And when you say it stopped working this morning, do you remember what time that was, or was it just when you went to use it?

Customer: I mean, I didn't notice until like eight o'clock this morning when I tried to work from home. I'm not sure exactly when it happened.

Agent: Understood. Okay, so I want to try one more thing before we move forward. Can you unplug the coaxial cable—that's the cable that comes in from outside, the one that connects to the modem—can you disconnect that, wait about ten seconds, and reconnect it? Sometimes a reset of that connection can help.

Customer: (pause) The cable from outside? (background noise) Okay, I'm unplugging that now. (pause) Ten seconds. (longer pause) Reconnecting it.

Agent: Good. Now go ahead and plug the modem back in again.

Customer: Wait, I thought I already had it plugged in?

Agent: You did, but let's give it a complete power cycle one more time now that we've reseated the cable. Go ahead and unplug it from power again.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Done. Waiting... (pause) Now plugging it in.

Agent: (pause, waiting) Alright, let's give it that minute or so to boot up again.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm still not seeing anything. This is really frustrating. I have a meeting in like an hour and I need to get this working.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me be honest with you—based on everything we've tried, it really does sound like the modem itself may have failed. The fact that there's no power indicator at all is the key issue here.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long is it gonna take to fix?

Agent: Well, here's what we can do. I can file a service ticket and get a replacement modem sent out to you. However, I do want to explore one more option first, if you don't mind.

Customer: Okay, what is it?

Agent: Do you have access to another modem? Maybe a friend or family member nearby? Just to test if that's really the issue?

Customer: (pause) I mean, not right now, no. Everyone I know is at work.

Agent: I figured. Okay, let me put you on a brief hold while I check our system for expedited shipping options for a replacement unit. It'll just be a moment.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: (hold music, pause, approximately 30 seconds) Thank you for your patience. Okay, so I've got some options for you. I can get a replacement modem shipped out to you today, and depending on where you are, you could potentially have it by tomorrow or the day after. But there's also a possibility that the issue is with the line coming into your home from our infrastructure. 

Customer: So like, it's not just the modem?

Agent: Right, it could also be a line issue. What I'd recommend is that we schedule a technician visit to come out and check both the modem and the line connection. They can properly diagnose what's happening.

Customer: How soon can they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability. (pause) I'm showing we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could potentially do the day after between 1 PM and 5 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works for me. Tomorrow between 8 and 12.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, August 15th, between 8 AM and noon. A technician will come out to your location at 2847 Maple Street and diagnose the issue.

Customer: Okay, great. So they'll bring a new modem if that's what it is?

Agent: In most cases, yes. If it's the modem, they'll have a replacement with them. If it's a line issue, they'll repair that. But they're equipped to handle both scenarios. Can I get a phone number to contact you if the technician needs to reach you?

Customer: The number on the account should be fine.

Agent: Perfect, it's 555-0147. We already have that. Now, I do want to mention that there is a service call fee of $99 if this is determined to be a customer equipment issue. However, if it's determined to be an issue with our infrastructure or line, there will be no charge. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yeah, I guess so. I mean, hopefully it's not my equipment, but we'll see.

Agent: I understand. Well, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident they'll get you up and running. You're all set with that appointment for tomorrow morning. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today.

Customer: Yeah, no problem. Thanks for trying. Bye.

Agent: Have a good day!
