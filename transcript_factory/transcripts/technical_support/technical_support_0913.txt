Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your phone number or account number?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Walk me through what happened.

Customer: Well, I woke up and tried to check my email and just... nothing. No internet at all. I didn't do anything different. It just stopped working.

Agent: Alright. And what type of modem do you have? Is it the Frontier-issued one or...?

Customer: Uh, yeah, it's the one you guys gave me. It's that white box thing.

Agent: Okay, perfect. So what I'm gonna need you to do first is just check the lights on the front of the modem for me. Can you do that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, hold on. (background noise) Okay, so... I see a red light, I think? And then... nothing on the other ones.

Agent: Alright, so just the red light. That typically indicates there's no connection to our network. Have you had any power outages in your area this morning, or did the modem lose power at any point?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of. I mean, everything else is working fine. The lights in my house are on, my TV is on...

Agent: Right, right. Okay, let's do a power cycle. What I need you to do is unplug the modem from the power outlet, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) How long do I wait?

Agent: Just about thirty seconds. You can count it out or just... give it half a minute.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (background noise) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait for it to fully boot up. That should take about two to three minutes. While we're waiting, let me ask you—have you noticed any issues with the internet lately? Any outages or slowness?

Customer: No, no. It was working fine yesterday. I was online all evening.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay. And are you the only person in the house, or do you have other devices connected?

Customer: My wife's here but she's not using anything right now. We usually have our phones connected, stuff like that.

Agent: Got it. Alright, go ahead and take a look at that modem again. What are the lights showing now?

Customer: (pause) Still just the red light. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Let's try something else. Can you check the back of the modem and make sure all the cables are plugged in firmly? Sometimes they can wiggle loose.

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Yeah, I'm checking... the cable that goes to the wall, that's in there. And then there's like... a power cable, that's in. Um, there's one more but it looks like... oh.

Agent: What? What is it?

Customer: Well, this cable back here, it's... it doesn't look like it's all the way in. Like, it's kind of loose.

Agent: Okay! That could very well be it. Go ahead and push that all the way in.

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Okay, pushing it in... (pause) Alright, it's in there.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it another minute or so to reconnect. While we wait, do you remember which cable that was?

Customer: I'm not really sure. I'm not super tech-savvy with this stuff.

Agent: That's alright. Most of the time it's fine. Check the modem again in about a minute.

Customer: (pause) (longer pause) Okay, so... it's still red. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Still red, huh? (pause) Okay, let me try one more thing. I'm going to restart the connection from my end here. Can you just keep an eye on those lights for me?

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I've sent the restart command. You should see the lights flicker or change in the next few seconds.

Customer: (pause) I see... they're starting to flicker, actually. Oh! Now there's a green light!

Agent: Excellent! That's what we want to see. The green light means you've got a connection. Give it another thirty seconds to fully stabilize.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Um, it's still green now. That's good, right?

Agent: That's great! Now, can you try connecting to the internet? Pull up a website or something and let me know if it works.

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Yeah, I'm trying to pull up Google... (longer pause) ...nothing's happening. It's just loading. And loading. (longer pause) This is taking forever.

Agent: Is it still loading, or did it time out?

Customer: (pause) It timed out. "Connection timed out," it says.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, so the modem is connected, but we're not getting internet through. That's... that's interesting. Let me check a few things on my end. (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, I'm actually not seeing your equipment as provisioned correctly in our system.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: It means that... well, it looks like there might be an issue with your account registration in our network. Sometimes the modem needs to be re-registered. Let me try to push that through. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm trying to initiate that now, but I'm not getting a successful response.

Customer: So what's... what's happening? Can you fix it?

Agent: I'm trying. Give me just one second. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing that the signal is actually pretty weak coming from your modem. That might be part of the issue. How far are you from the... do you know where the nearest node is on your street?

Customer: I have no idea. I don't even know what that means, honestly.

Agent: Right, yeah. Um, it's basically the connection point from our fiber line. It's usually somewhere on your street. When was the last time a technician was out to your place?

Customer: Oh, I don't know. When we first got set up, I guess? That was like two years ago.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Well, based on what I'm seeing, I think we might need to get a technician out there. There could be an issue with the line itself or something with your equipment that I can't diagnose from here.

Customer: Really? How long would that take? I really need internet today if possible.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so we have availability tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Unfortunately, nothing's available today.

Customer: (frustrated) Tomorrow? I really needed it today.

Agent: I understand, and I'm sorry about that. But based on the weak signal and the provisioning issues I'm seeing, this is something that's gonna require an in-person visit. There might be an issue with the fiber connection itself, and that's not something I can troubleshoot remotely.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, well... I guess I'll have to make it work. Can you just schedule that for tomorrow?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) Alright, I've got you down for tomorrow, December 19th, between 12 PM and 4 PM. A technician will come out and assess the situation. Is the address on file still current?

Customer: Yeah, same address.

Agent: Perfect. You should receive a text message confirmation within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully you guys can figure it out tomorrow.

Agent: We'll definitely get to the bottom of it. I apologize you're without internet today, but our technician should be able to resolve this. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
