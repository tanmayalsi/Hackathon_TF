Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got some important work stuff I need to do, so I'm kind of stressed about this.

Agent: I completely understand. That's frustrating. I'm sorry you're experiencing that. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. I've got you here. So you're at... 428 Oakmont Drive?

Customer: That's correct, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, your service went down about an hour ago, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, roughly an hour. Maybe a little bit more actually. I was working and just... the connection dropped and now nothing's coming through. My Wi-Fi's not showing up, nothing.

Agent: Okay. Before we go further, have you done any basic troubleshooting? Like, have you tried restarting your modem and router yet?

Customer: (pause) The modem, no, I haven't. I didn't think... yeah, I guess I should try that first, huh?

Agent: It's definitely worth a shot. These things reset themselves and it fixes most connection issues. Do you have access to your equipment right now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it. It's in the living room. So I just... unplug it?

Agent: Exactly. Go ahead and unplug the modem—that's the box that looks like it has all the cables running into it. Once you pull the power, just give it about thirty seconds, then plug it back in. While that's restarting, I'll also go ahead and check if there are any service disruptions in your area.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) All right, it's unplugged.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And I'm not seeing any service alerts or outages in your zip code, so that's a good sign. How's that modem looking now?

Customer: (pause) The lights are still off. Let me wait another... I mean, you said thirty seconds, right?

Agent: Yeah, about thirty seconds from when you unplugged it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, lights are coming back on now. There's the green light... and... (pause) hmm. It's just doing that blinking thing.

Agent: That's normal. It's just initializing. That usually takes a minute or so. While we wait for it to fully boot up, let me ask—do you have a separate router, or is it a combo unit?

Customer: Oh, um... I'm not totally sure what you mean by separate? I have the white box you guys installed.

Agent: Right, so that's likely a combo unit then. That's fine. Once the modem finishes booting, you should see a solid green light. When you do, can you restart the router as well? You can usually hold down the reset button for about ten seconds, or you can just unplug it for thirty seconds like we did with the modem.

Customer: Okay, got it. (pause) Still blinking.

Agent: That's okay, it takes a moment. So while we're waiting, I'm pulling up your account details here. Everything looks good on our end. Your service should be active and running. How's that light looking now?

Customer: (pause) It's... it's still blinking. It's been like a minute and a half, right? Or maybe...

Agent: Yeah, it should be solid by now. That's a little unusual. Let me ask you this—are there any lights that are red or orange on the modem right now?

Customer: Um, there's like... an orange light on the side. I didn't mention that before, sorry.

Agent: No worries. Okay, so that orange light—which light is it exactly? Is it the power light, or is it labeled as something else?

Customer: It says... (pause) I'm getting closer... it says "Internet." That one's orange.

Agent: Okay, that's actually the Internet light, and that tells me the modem is having trouble connecting to our network. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Have you noticed if your modem has been reset or rebooted recently? Like, did anything happen before the outage? Power surge, storm, anything like that?

Customer: No, not that I know of. It was working fine this morning and I had no issues. Then like I said, an hour ago, just... nothing.

Agent: Got it. Let me try a couple more things here. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem. This won't erase anything, it'll just refresh the connection. Give me about two minutes and let me know if that orange light changes.

Customer: All right. (pause) I'll just... wait?

Agent: Yeah, exactly. Just give it a minute or two. I'm watching things from my end here too. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, how's it looking?

Customer: (pause) Still orange. Same thing.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Let me try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem again, and this time wait for a full minute before plugging it back in?

Customer: A full minute? Okay, sure. (pause) Unplugging it now... (pause) All right. Waiting... (long pause) Okay, it's been about a minute. Plugging it back in... (pause) Lights are coming back...

Agent: Take your time. Let's give it a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the green power light is back, it's blinking the same way, and... (pause) the Internet light is still orange.

Agent: Okay, and there's still no solid green on the Internet light?

Customer: No, just orange.

Agent: (pause) All right. I think at this point what we're looking at might be an issue with the modem itself. The fact that the Internet light isn't connecting even after the resets tells me there might be a hardware issue, or possibly a line problem on our end that we're not picking up. I'd like to get a technician out to you to take a look at the line and swap out the modem if needed.

Customer: Oh man. (pause) Okay, so like... when would that be?

Agent: Well, let me check our availability. (typing sounds) I'm looking at tomorrow and the day after. We have a morning slot available tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we also have an afternoon slot Wednesday between 1 PM and 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning is better. I really need to get this working.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get that booked for you. That'll be tomorrow, March 14th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. Our technician will come out, check the line, and if it's a modem issue, they'll replace it for you. Can I get a callback number to confirm the appointment?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147, same as the account.

Agent: Perfect. Now, just to set expectations—there's a possibility that this could be a service line issue, which would require some investigation, but the tech will be able to diagnose that on-site. Is there anything else I should note for the technician?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. So tomorrow morning, 8 to 12?

Agent: That's correct. You should get a confirmation text or email shortly. If you need to reschedule, you can call us back or reply to that confirmation. I'm really sorry we couldn't resolve this remotely today, but I'm confident our tech will get you sorted out tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks for trying, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Sorry again for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything.

Agent: All right. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
