Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of, and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account here for... is this Michael Torres?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage this morning?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. I've got nothing. And I really need it because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I understand. Let me ask you a few quick questions to help troubleshoot. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is your modem powered on?

Customer: Oh, yeah. The modem is on. I can see the light... well, actually, that's the thing. The light on the modem is, uh... it's blinking red. Is that bad?

Agent: Okay, a red blinking light typically indicates there's no signal coming in from our network. But let's walk through a few things. Do you have a router as well, or are you using just the modem?

Customer: I have both. They're separate units.

Agent: Alright, good. And what color is the light on your router?

Customer: Um... it's also red. It's blinking red too.

Agent: Okay. And when did this start exactly?

Customer: I'd say around 7 this morning? Maybe 7:15? I went to check my email and nothing was loading, so...

Agent: Got it. Well, the first thing I'd like you to try is a simple restart. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cord out completely.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, doing it now.

Agent: Great. And while that's unplugged, can you also unplug the router?

Customer: (pause) Okay, router's unplugged too.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's just wait about 30 seconds for everything to power down completely. (pause) You still there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Great. Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (plugging in sounds) It's back in.

Agent: And just give it about a minute to boot back up. You should see some lights cycling through.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm seeing some lights now. They're... they're amber colored now, which is different from before.

Agent: That's good. That's progress. We're looking for solid green lights typically. Just give it another moment to fully initialize... (pause) How are we looking?

Customer: Still amber. It's been like... maybe 45 seconds now.

Agent: Okay, let's give it a full minute or two. While we're waiting, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm checking for any service alerts in your area. Hold on just one second.

Customer: Sure.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm not seeing any widespread outages in your area currently. That's good. How about that modem now?

Customer: Still amber.

Agent: Still amber? Okay. And you can see the modem is fully connected? There's a cable going into the back of it from the wall?

Customer: (pause) ...yeah, there's a cable. It looks good to me.

Agent: Alright. Now go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (plugging in) Okay, router's back in.

Agent: (pause) And let's give that another minute or so to connect to the modem. You should see some activity happening between them.

Customer: I see some blinking on the router now. Green and amber, kind of alternating.

Agent: Okay, that's... well, that could be a good sign. Let me check something. Can you try opening your browser? Just try going to any website, like Google or whatever you normally go to.

Customer: (typing sounds, long pause) No, nothing. It's just... the page won't load. It says connection timed out or something.

Agent: Okay. And the modem, is it showing... can you tell me what lights you're seeing now? Specifically, is there one that says "Internet" on it?

Customer: (pause) Um, let me look closer. Yeah, I see one that says Internet. It's... it's red.

Agent: Red?

Customer: Yeah, solid red. It's not blinking anymore, but it's definitely red.

Agent: That's the issue right there. That red Internet light means the modem isn't detecting a signal from our network. Let me ask you this – have there been any storms in your area recently? Power outages?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Weather's been fine.

Agent: Okay. Um, let me try something else. I'm going to check the signal levels from our end. (typing sounds) What kind of modem do you have? Do you know the model?

Customer: Uh... (pause) it's... let me see. It says Frontier... something. It's got a bunch of numbers on it. F-G-something?

Agent: Can you read me exactly what it says?

Customer: Okay, it says... "FGW4553" I think?

Agent: (typing) Okay, FGW4553. Got it. And just... just to triple-check, when you look at the cable coming from the wall, it's definitely firmly connected to the back of the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's in there. I mean... let me just double-check. (pause) Yeah, it's definitely plugged in.

Agent: Okay. Um, I'm looking at the signal levels from our infrastructure here, and I'm... I'm actually not detecting a strong signal on your line right now. That could mean a few things. It could be something with the line outside, or it could be an issue with the modem itself.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: Well, normally in a situation like this, I would schedule a technician to come out and take a look at the line and the equipment. They can test everything and see if we need to replace the modem or if there's an issue with the external line.

Customer: How soon could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability. What day works best for you?

Customer: Today? Is today possible? I really need internet to work.

Agent: Let me... (pause) I'm checking now. Unfortunately, today is pretty booked up. I'm showing an opening tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM, or we could do Thursday morning, 8 AM to 12 PM?

Customer: (sigh) Can't you do anything today? This is really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Michael. And I wish I could get someone out there today. But based on what we're seeing – or not seeing – on the line, this is going to need hands-on troubleshooting. The good news is we can get someone out tomorrow afternoon.

Customer: ...Okay, tomorrow afternoon then. What time exactly?

Agent: It would be between 12 and 4 PM. Our technician will come to your home within that window. They'll likely call about 30 minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Alright.

Agent: Is tomorrow afternoon good for you?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I guess it'll have to be. Can I do anything in the meantime?

Agent: Unfortunately, with that red Internet light on the modem, there's not much we can do remotely. Just keep it powered on, and try not to unplug and replug it anymore – we want to avoid any confusion when the tech gets there. They'll be able to diagnose the problem right away.

Customer: Okay, will they charge me for this?

Agent: No, there won't be any charge for the technician visit. It's covered under our standard service call policy.

Customer: Okay, good. And they'll have a modem with them if mine needs to be replaced?

Agent: They should have equipment with them if it's needed, yes. Let me get your contact information to make sure the appointment is set up correctly. Your phone number is 555-0147?

Customer: That's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So we have you down for tomorrow, between 12 and 4 PM. You should receive a confirmation email shortly, and the technician will call when they're about 30 minutes away. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Alright, Michael, I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today. But I'm confident that once our technician gets out there tomorrow, they'll be able to fix this for you.

Customer: Okay, I hope so. This is the second time this year this has happened.

Agent: I understand. Well, the tech can look into that as well. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it.

Agent: Alright, thank you for calling Frontier, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day, Michael.

Customer: Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Bye.

Customer: Bye.
