Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, so my internet just completely stopped working about an hour ago. I've got three people working from home and we're all just... stuck right now.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And what's the best name to have on the account?

Customer: It's under James Mitchell.

Agent: Great, James. Thanks for that. So let me ask you a few quick questions. When you say the internet stopped working, is it everything? Like, no lights on the modem or router, or...?

Customer: No, actually the modem's got lights on it. There's a couple of them that are blinking, but they're red. And the router's... I think it's doing the same thing?

Agent: Okay, red lights are usually indicating there's a connection issue. That's actually good information. Are you able to see any kind of orange or amber lights on there, or is it strictly red?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's mostly red. There might be like... one that's kind of orange-ish? I'm not totally sure, to be honest.

Agent: That's alright. Let me get you to restart those devices and that'll often clear things up. So what I want you to do is unplug the modem first—that's the larger box, usually. Just pull the power cord out.

Customer: The larger one, yeah. Okay, doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now let that sit for about 30 seconds while we give it time to fully power down. I'm gonna ask you to also unplug your router at the same time, so go ahead and do that for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, both are unplugged now.

Agent: Great. And we're just gonna count to thirty real quick. In the meantime, James, have you had any recent changes? New equipment, any storms in your area recently, anything like that?

Customer: No, no storms. It's been pretty clear actually. But, um, I did have a tech come out like... three weeks ago? He came to upgrade the line or something. I don't really know what he did exactly.

Agent: Okay, that's useful information. Sometimes after those upgrades it takes a little bit for everything to settle in. Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first—that's the big one.

Customer: Plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, lights are... they're coming on. Give me a second. (pause) Yeah, now I'm seeing some green and... some red still.

Agent: That's actually normal during startup. Those usually settle down. Give that about a minute to fully boot up, and then go ahead and plug in your router.

Customer: (pause) Router's plugged in. (pause) It's starting up too.

Agent: Perfect. Now we're gonna give this about two to three minutes to fully come online. While we wait, let me just verify your service is active on the account here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any service interruptions in your area, so that's good news. Your account is showing as active.

Customer: (pause) Okay, but I'm still not getting internet. The lights on the modem... there's still red ones.

Agent: Still seeing red? Okay. And do you have anything plugged into the modem right now? Like a computer or anything?

Customer: No, nothing. Just the power.

Agent: Alright. Let me try a different approach here. I want you to do what's called a factory reset on the modem. Are you comfortable doing that?

Customer: Uh... what does that involve?

Agent: It's super simple. On the back of the modem, there should be a small button—probably labeled "Reset." I want you to hold that down for about 10 to 15 seconds.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking at the back... yeah, I see a little button here. It's like... recessed in, right?

Agent: That's the one. You might need something thin like a pen or paperclip to press it since it's recessed.

Customer: Oh, got it. (pause) Okay, using a pen. Holding it down now. (pause) How long?

Agent: Keep holding... three more seconds... and release.

Customer: (pause) Okay, released. Now what?

Agent: The modem's gonna restart. This time it might take a little longer—could be three to five minutes. During this time, try not to do anything with it. Just let it sit.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm watching it. The lights are... they're flashing a lot now, like cycling through colors.

Agent: That's actually exactly what we want to see. That means it's recalibrating. How's that looking after a minute?

Customer: (pause) Still flashing. Still got the red in there.

Agent: Okay, just give it a bit more time. (pause) James, while we're waiting, do you happen to know if your bill is current? Sometimes we have service suspensions if there's an account issue.

Customer: No, no, I pay that automatically. It should be fine.

Agent: (typing sounds) I'm just checking here... yeah, your account's in good standing. All caught up. (pause) How's the modem looking now?

Customer: Um... same as before. Red lights are still there. It's been probably five minutes now, maybe longer.

Agent: Okay. Let me try something else here. I'm going to check your connection status from my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm actually not seeing your modem connecting to our network right now. That's the issue.

Customer: What does that mean? Like, the modem is broken?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be the modem itself, or it could be a line issue. Let me ask you—do you see any fiber optic cable running into your modem? It might be a thin, white, or sometimes clear-ish cable?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's definitely a cable. It looks kind of... I don't know, it looks fine to me. It's connected, I think.

Agent: Can you gently try to disconnect and reconnect it? Just make sure it's seated properly. You might hear a little click.

Customer: (pause) Okay, disconnecting. (pause) And... reconnecting. Yeah, I heard a click.

Agent: Great. And the modem's doing anything different now?

Customer: (pause) No, it's... it's the same. Still red and flashing.

Agent: Alright, I've tried several troubleshooting steps here, James, and unfortunately we're not getting a connection on our end. At this point, I think we might be looking at either a hardware issue with the modem itself or a line issue on our side that I'm not able to fully diagnose remotely.

Customer: So what does that mean? When can I get internet back?

Agent: So here's what I'd recommend. We can either ship you a replacement modem, which would take about three to five business days, or we can schedule a technician to come out to your home. They could be there potentially as soon as tomorrow, depending on availability in your area. They'd be able to physically check the line and the equipment.

Customer: Tomorrow would be way better. We really need this working.

Agent: Absolutely, I understand. Let me check what we have available for tomorrow. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm seeing we have availability between 8 AM and 12 PM, or between 1 PM and 5 PM. Which window works better for you?

Customer: Morning's better. Eight to noon.

Agent: Perfect. I've got you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. The tech's gonna call you about 30 minutes before he arrives. Is the number on file, 555-0847, the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Excellent. I'm gonna email you a confirmation with the appointment details and a reference number. And James, I really apologize that we couldn't get this resolved today over the phone, but the technician should be able to get you back up and running tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, thanks, I guess. Hopefully this gets fixed.

Agent: We'll definitely take care of you. Is there anything else I can help with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, sorry for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.
