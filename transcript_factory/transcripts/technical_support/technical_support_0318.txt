Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out completely. I've got no connection at all, and I really need to get this working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I grab your account number or phone number associated with the account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm pulling up your account now... Okay, I've got you here. So your internet is completely down as of right now?

Customer: Yeah, like, maybe thirty minutes ago? I was just working from home and suddenly everything just... stopped.

Agent: Okay, I understand. That's frustrating, especially when you're working. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you able to see your modem right now? Do you have a modem and router, or is it a combined unit?

Customer: I've got both. They're in my office. Let me look... (pause) Okay, I'm looking at them now. The modem has some lights on it, but they're not... they're not the normal colors?

Agent: Okay, good. Can you describe what you're seeing? What colors are the lights?

Customer: Um, there's a red light on the modem. I think that's bad, right? And the router is... it's got nothing. No lights at all.

Agent: Alright, so the router has no lights at all. That actually suggests the router might not be powered on. Do you see a power cable connected to the router?

Customer: (pause) Let me check... Yeah, it's plugged in. I can see the cable going into the back.

Agent: Okay. And the outlet it's plugged into—is that outlet working? Like, do you have anything else plugged into it that's currently on?

Customer: Nothing else is plugged in there, but... (pause) wait, actually, I just noticed the outlet might not be working. I've got a lamp on this desk that's also not turning on.

Agent: Ah, okay. So it sounds like your outlet might be the issue here. Can you try plugging the router into a different outlet? Maybe somewhere else in your office?

Customer: Yeah, let me unplug it... (pause) Okay, I'm moving over here. I've got an outlet by the window... (pause) Plugging it in now...

Agent: Great. Give it about thirty seconds to boot up. The router should start showing some lights.

Customer: (pause) Um... still nothing. Like, complete darkness on the router.

Agent: Hmm, okay. And you're certain the power cable is fully seated in the back of the router?

Customer: I mean, I think so? Let me... (pause) Yeah, it looks plugged in pretty good.

Agent: Let me try something else. Can you check the modem again? You mentioned it had a red light?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, still got the red light. Maybe one other light, but it's very dim.

Agent: Okay, a red light on the modem typically indicates either no signal or a connection issue. I'm going to need you to do a full reset here. Can you unplug the modem from power for about sixty seconds?

Customer: Unplug the modem? Like, completely?

Agent: Yes, completely. Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now, while that's unplugged, can you also unplug the router if it's actually plugged in?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, router's unplugged too.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about sixty to ninety seconds. I know it seems like a long time, but this helps clear the system.

Customer: Okay... (long pause) ...Still waiting?

Agent: Yeah, we're almost there. About another thirty seconds or so.

Customer: (pause) Alright, how's that?

Agent: You can go ahead and plug the modem back in first. Give it about two minutes to fully boot up. You should see the lights start cycling through different colors, and then they should settle into a stable pattern.

Customer: (pause, sounds of plugging in) Okay, modem's back in. Let me watch it... (pause) I'm seeing some lights now. There's some blue and green... and now it looks like it's settling down to... just some green lights, I think.

Agent: Excellent. That's exactly what we want to see. Now go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, router's plugged in... (pause) Waiting for it to turn on...

Agent: (pause) How's it looking?

Customer: (pause) Still... nothing. There's like, no lights at all on the router.

Agent: Hmm, that's unusual. Can you check the power cable one more time? Really make sure it's fully inserted into the back of the unit?

Customer: I'll check... (pause) [inaudible] Yeah, it's... wait. Oh. Oh no.

Agent: What is it?

Customer: I don't think this cable is connected all the way. It looks like it might be loose. Let me... (pause) I'm pushing it in harder... 

Agent: Okay, give that a good push.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. The cable seems fine on my end, but the port on the router might be... I'm not sure. It's hard to see back there.

Agent: Okay. Well, it's possible the power port on the router is damaged. Before we go down that road, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Let me look at your modem status here... (pause) Alright, so your modem is showing a connection now, but it's not broadcasting a Wi-Fi signal, which means your router isn't communicating with it.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could mean one of two things. Either the router isn't getting power—which is what we're seeing—or there's a connection issue between the modem and router. Since the router has no lights at all, I'm leaning towards a power issue with the router itself.

Customer: Can you, like... can you send someone out? Or do I need to buy a new router?

Agent: (pause) Let me check what I can do for you here. (typing sounds) Okay, so you have a standard service plan with us. The modem is ours, but the router—did you purchase that separately, or did that come with your service?

Customer: I think it came with... actually, I'm not sure. I've had it for a few years.

Agent: Okay. Since it's been a few years, it's likely not covered under our warranty anymore. However, I can definitely escalate this to our technical support team for a more in-depth diagnostic. I can also order a replacement router to be sent to you if you'd like—that would be about $99 or you can opt for a monthly rental option.

Customer: Wait, I have to pay for that? The internet just... stopped working. Why am I paying for a replacement?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Unfortunately, if the router is a customer-owned unit, we do charge for replacements. However, what I can do is schedule a technician to come out to your home at no charge, and they can do a full diagnostic to confirm whether it's actually a hardware failure or if there's something else going on.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what's available in your area... (pause) I'm showing we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or the day after tomorrow in the afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works. Can you do that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, I've got a technician scheduled to arrive between 8 and noon tomorrow. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. Is that number 555-0847 still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell. That's fine.

Agent: Perfect. Now, just to set expectations—the technician will be able to confirm whether it's a router issue or if there's something else happening. If it is the router, they can discuss replacement options with you at that time.

Customer: Okay, so I'm just without internet until then?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. Unless you have a mobile hotspot you can use, you would be without service until we can get this resolved.

Customer: [inaudible] This is really not ideal. I have work calls tomorrow morning.

Agent: I completely understand. I wish I could get you back online right now. If you need to jump on any calls tomorrow before the technician arrives, using a mobile hotspot would be your best bet. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: (pause) No, I guess not. So tomorrow morning, 8 to noon?

Agent: That's correct. Between 8 AM and noon. You'll get those confirmations shortly. Is there a preferred phone number the technician should use to reach you when they're on their way?

Customer: No, the text is fine.

Agent: Great. Well, I appreciate your patience today, and I apologize we couldn't get you back online immediately. We should have this sorted out once the technician gets there tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow. Have a good day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
