Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went down about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and router and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And just to confirm, is this for the address on file at 2834 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned you've already tried unplugging the modem and router. Just to walk through a few things with you—when you say the internet is down, are you seeing any lights on the modem at all? Any lights on the front of it?

Customer: Um, yeah, there's... okay, so there's a power light that's on, but the internet light, it's just not lit up. It's dark. And the WiFi light on the router is also off.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on but the internet indicator isn't lighting up. That's helpful. And just to clarify, when you unplugged everything, how long did you leave it unplugged for?

Customer: Maybe like 30 seconds? I just pulled the plugs and plugged them back in pretty quick.

Agent: Got it. Sometimes it helps to leave them unplugged a little longer—usually around two minutes—to let everything fully reset. Why don't we try that? Go ahead and unplug the modem first, and then unplug the router.

Customer: Okay, (sounds of unplugging) ...both unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's just wait about two minutes. I'll be right here with you.

Customer: (pause) So... is this happening to other people in my area or is it just me, do you know?

Agent: That's a good question. Let me check our system here for any outages in your neighborhood. (typing sounds) No, I'm not seeing any active outages reported in your area, so it shouldn't be a widespread issue. It's likely something with your equipment or line.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that's... I guess that's a little better.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let's go ahead and plug the modem back in first. Give that about 30 seconds to fully boot up, and then we'll plug the router back in.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Done. I'm waiting... okay, should be good now.

Agent: Good. Now go ahead and plug the router back in as well.

Customer: (plugging sound) Alright, it's in.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give that about 60 seconds to fully boot up and connect. While we're waiting, are you using the WiFi or are you hardwired into the modem?

Customer: I'm usually on WiFi, but I can plug in directly if you need me to.

Agent: Actually, that would be really helpful. If you can plug into the modem with an ethernet cable, we can rule out any router issues. Do you have a cable nearby?

Customer: Yeah, I've got one right here. (pause) Okay, it's plugged in.

Agent: Great. Now go ahead and try opening a website or checking your connection. Let me know what you see.

Customer: (pause) ...nothing. Still nothing. The light's still off and I'm getting no connection on my computer either.

Agent: Okay, I hear you. Let me check a few things on our end. (typing sounds) I'm going to send a signal to your modem. This will take just a moment...

(pause)

Agent: Alright, so I'm sending the signal but I'm not getting a response from your modem at all. That's... that's a bit unusual. Let me ask—have you had any storms recently? Any bad weather?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was fine all morning, and then around noon it just... stopped working.

Agent: Right, okay. So this was sudden. Um, let me check your line status here. (typing sounds) Okay, so on our end, it's showing that we are sending signal to your address, but your modem isn't responding to it at all. That typically means either the modem has a hardware issue or there's a problem with the line coming into your house.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like... is the modem broken?

Agent: It could be the modem, but it could also be the connection line itself. Let me try something. Can you check the cable that's coming from the wall into your modem? Just make sure it's plugged in firmly?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. It looks pretty secure, but let me try unplugging it and plugging it back in. (unplugging sound) ...and back in.

Agent: Okay, great. Now let's try waiting another minute for it to reconnect.

Customer: (waiting) Still nothing. The light is still off.

Agent: (pause) Alright, so... unfortunately, at this point, it looks like we may have a hardware issue with your modem or there could be a problem with the line coming into your home that we can't diagnose from here remotely. I think we're going to need to get a technician out to your location to take a look and potentially replace your modem or check the line infrastructure.

Customer: Oh, man. Really? When can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) We have openings tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we could schedule you for Wednesday between 1 and 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: I really need it fixed ASAP. Can he come tomorrow morning?

Agent: I can absolutely get you scheduled for tomorrow morning. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you down for tomorrow between 8 and noon at 2834 Maple Street. A technician will be out there to investigate and resolve the issue. You should receive a confirmation email and text message within the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. I just really hope it's an easy fix.

Agent: I understand. Our technician will get to the bottom of it. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye now.
