# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so my internet went out sometime last night and I've been without it all morning. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Uh, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. So you've been without service since last night, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 10 PM last night. I was just working on my laptop and then everything just stopped.

Agent: Alright, I see your account here. And just to confirm, you're experiencing a complete loss of internet, correct? The modem isn't showing any lights or anything?

Customer: No, I mean, the modem has lights. Let me look... yeah, there's like a power light, but I don't see the internet light. It's usually blue but I'm not seeing it now.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So the device is powered on, but we're not seeing the internet signal. Let me just run a quick line test here to see if there's an issue on our end. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so on my end I'm not detecting a strong signal to your modem either. Let's try some basic troubleshooting first. Have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in?

Customer: No, not yet. Let me do that right now.

Agent: Perfect, go ahead and unplug it, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (sound of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now... (pause) Okay, it's rebooting, I think. The lights are doing that thing where they're all blinking.

Agent: Good, that's normal. That means it's initializing. Give it about a minute or two to fully boot up and get a signal.

Customer: (pause) Um, okay... the power light is solid now, but still no blue internet light.

Agent: Hmm, alright. Let me ask you a few more questions. Did you experience any storms last night or this morning? Sometimes that can affect the connection.

Customer: You know, actually, yeah. There was pretty heavy rain and wind like around the time it went out. Could that be it?

Agent: It's possible. Severe weather can sometimes cause issues with the line. Let me check for any outages in your area. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any active outages reported in your zip code right now, but sometimes it takes a few minutes for those to update. Have you checked if your modem is fully seated in the outlet? Sometimes during storms there can be vibrations that loosen things.

Customer: (pause) Let me check... yeah, it looks pretty plugged in to me.

Agent: Okay. And just to be thorough, is there a coaxial cable running into the modem? The thick cable that comes from the wall?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, it's there. The cable's connected.

Agent: Great. And that connection is tight? Can you give it a gentle tug to make sure it's secure?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, feels tight. I don't think that's it.

Agent: Alright. I'm going to check a couple other things on my end. Can you give me one moment? (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your line was active until about 10:17 PM last night, and then it just cut off completely. And we haven't reestablished a connection since then.

Customer: Okay, so you're saying the issue might be on my end or with the actual line?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be equipment failure on your modem, it could be a line issue on our end, or it could be something external like weather damage. Let me try rebooting the modem one more time from my end. Sometimes that can help. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm sending a reboot command now.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Um, I see the lights are blinking again.

Agent: Alright, let's wait for it to come back online. (pause) How long have you had your modem with us?

Customer: Uh, probably like three or four years now? It's the one you guys provided.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Is it back online yet?

Customer: (pause) No, still just the power light. Same thing as before.

Agent: (sigh) Okay, this is unusual. You know what, I think we might be looking at a hardware failure or something going on with the line itself. Let me schedule a technician to come out and take a look. That's probably going to be your best bet at this point.

Customer: How long before someone can come out? I really need this working today if possible.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so... we have an opening this afternoon between 1 and 3 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that works. What do I need to do?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home to let them in. They'll bring a new modem with them in case that's the issue, and they'll check the line coming in from the street as well. They'll be able to diagnose the problem pretty quickly. Your appointment confirmation number is 7849302. Did you get that?

Customer: Yeah, 7849302.

Agent: Perfect. And you should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. Just to recap everything we tried—we rebooted the modem twice, verified your connections, and I ran a line test on my end. Everything points to either an equipment issue or a line problem that a technician will need to physically inspect.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate you trying. I'm just frustrated because I need to work from home today. Is there any way to expedite this?

Agent: I totally understand. Unfortunately, that's the earliest availability we have today. But our technicians are usually pretty efficient, so hopefully they'll get you up and running quickly once they arrive. If you have any other questions before they get there, please don't hesitate to call back.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and again, we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
