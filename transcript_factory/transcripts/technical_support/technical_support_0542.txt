Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet just went out completely like an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that now. And your name?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got you here. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage, is that correct? No connection at all?

Customer: Right, nothing. My router's on, I can see the lights are on, but there's no... like, no internet connection. My phone's been on my hotspot all this time.

Agent: Okay, that's good information. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your modem right now?

Customer: Um, let me look. So I see a green light on the top, and then there's like a blue light that's usually blinking but I think it's... it's solid right now. And there's also like a red light on the side.

Agent: (pause) A red light? Okay, that's definitely something we need to address. The red light typically indicates there's an issue with the connection. Let's try a few things. First, I'm going to ask you to do a hard reset on your modem. Can you unplug it from the power source?

Customer: Yeah, give me a second. (background noise of moving around) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now just leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. While we wait, I'm going to check your line status here on my end.

Customer: (pause) Alright, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug that back in for me.

Customer: (background noise, plugging sounds) Okay, plugged back in.

Agent: Good. Now let's give it about two minutes to fully boot up. While it's starting, let me ask you—did anything unusual happen before this stopped working? Like a power outage, any storms in your area, or did you make any changes to your setup?

Customer: Um, no power outage that I noticed. There was some rain yesterday but nothing crazy. And I didn't... I didn't touch anything.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any active incidents in your area, so it's likely specific to your connection. How's that modem looking now? Are the lights starting to change?

Customer: Yeah, actually, um, the green light is definitely on now, and the blue light is... it's blinking a little bit. But that red light is still there.

Agent: The red light persisting is concerning. Let me try something else. Can you check the cable that goes from your modem to the wall outlet? It's the coaxial cable—it's the thicker one with metal connectors on each end.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Yeah, I see it. It looks... I don't know, it looks normal to me? It's connected pretty tight.

Agent: Okay, can you try unplugging it from the modem side and plugging it back in? Just to make sure it's seated properly.

Customer: Sure. (sound of disconnecting and reconnecting cable) There we go. Did that help?

Agent: Let's check. What are you seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Same thing. Red light's still there. The blue one's blinking though.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright. Let me check something on the back end. I'm going to look at your modem's signal levels... (pause, longer typing) Hmm, that's odd. The downstream signal looks weak, and the upstream signal is... actually, it's not registering at all.

Customer: Is that... is that bad?

Agent: Well, it usually means there's an issue with the line coming into your house or it could be the modem itself is having trouble communicating with our network. I'm seeing that your modem did attempt to connect multiple times in the last hour but kept dropping. Let me try to remotely reboot your modem from here.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (typing sounds) Attempting reboot now... this should take a couple minutes.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Alright, I'm just... I'm waiting here.

Agent: So while that's working, David, is this the first time you've experienced an outage like this, or has this happened before?

Customer: No, first time. I've had Frontier for like three years now and it's usually pretty solid, so I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I appreciate that. We do pride ourselves on reliability. Okay, let me check the status now... (pause) Unfortunately, the modem is still showing that red light and it's not establishing a stable connection with our network.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is the modem broken?

Agent: It could be, or it could be an issue with the line itself. At this point, I think we need to escalate this. I have two options for you. One is I can schedule a technician to come out to your home and check everything physically—your modem, the lines, all of that. Or, if you'd like to try, I could send you a replacement modem at no cost and see if that resolves the issue.

Customer: How long would it take to get a replacement modem?

Agent: We can have it to you in about three to five business days. The technician visit would be... (typing sounds) I'm showing availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or Thursday afternoon after 1 PM.

Customer: (pause) I mean, I really need internet working sooner than that if I can. Can the technician come tomorrow morning?

Agent: Let me check the availability for your area. (pause, typing sounds) Actually, we do have an opening. I can schedule a technician for tomorrow between 10 AM and noon. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works. That's better than three to five days.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just get a couple more details. Is there a best number to reach you at before the technician arrives?

Customer: You can use the same number on the account.

Agent: Great, and we'll be calling or sending you a text reminder about twenty-four hours before the appointment. The technician will need access to where your modem is and where the line comes into your house, typically outside or in a utility area. Will that be accessible?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Wonderful. So David, I've got you scheduled for a technician visit tomorrow, 10 AM to noon. Your confirmation number is FRN-4847293. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying to figure it out, even though we couldn't get it working.

Agent: Of course, I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved over the phone, but I'm confident our technician will be able to get you back up and running tomorrow. We really appreciate your business, and if you have any other questions before the visit, just give us a call back. Have a great day, David.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Goodbye.
