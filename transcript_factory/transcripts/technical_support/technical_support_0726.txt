Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it fixed. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what name is the account under?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) Okay, I've got you. I see you're on our fiber service in the Riverside area. So you're getting no internet connection at all right now, is that correct?

Customer: Right, nothing. The modem's been blinking red all morning. I tried unplugging it like I usually do, but that didn't help.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting step. So the modem is powered back on now?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. But it's still just blinking red.

Agent: Alright. So when you look at the modem, are you seeing any lights that are green, or is it just the red light?

Customer: Just red. Like, the power light is on, but everything else... I don't know, it's all red or off.

Agent: Got it. And are you connected directly to the modem with an ethernet cable, or are you using WiFi?

Customer: WiFi. Should I try a cable?

Agent: We can try that in a second. First, let me just check something on my end here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your line and I'm actually seeing that your modem isn't communicating with our network at all right now. That red light typically means there's either a signal issue or the modem isn't provisioned correctly.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it the modem that's broken?

Agent: Could be a few things. Let me walk you through a reset. Can you locate the reset button on the back of your modem? It's usually a small recessed button.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. Do I just press it?

Agent: Yes, but hold it down for about ten seconds while the modem is powered on. That'll do a factory reset.

Customer: Okay, holding it... (pause) ...ten seconds... (pause) Okay, I let go. Now what?

Agent: Now let's give it a minute or two to reboot. This might take a little bit.

Customer: (pause) Okay, um... still red though.

Agent: Still red? Okay. Let me try something else. Can you unplug the fiber optic cable from the back of the modem? It's the small cable that goes into the port labeled "Optical In" or something similar.

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's like this really thin cable?

Agent: That's the one. Go ahead and unplug that.

Customer: Okay, it's out. (pause) Nothing changed.

Agent: That's fine. Now plug it back in, nice and firm, and let's see if we get any lights to change.

Customer: (pause) Nope. Still... still red.

Agent: Alright. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) When was the last time you had this service working properly?

Customer: It was working fine yesterday. I was on it most of the afternoon. This morning I woke up and tried to check my email and... nothing.

Agent: And you haven't had any storms or power outages overnight?

Customer: No, nothing like that.

Agent: Okay. (pause) James, I'm going to be honest with you—what I'm seeing on my end is that your modem isn't sending any signal down the line. The resets we've done haven't helped, and that usually means either there's a problem with the equipment itself or there's something on the line side that's preventing the connection.

Customer: So... what do I do?

Agent: Well, we have a couple of options. I can schedule a technician to come out and take a look. They can check the line, swap out the modem if needed, make sure everything's working properly.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet today.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) So the earliest I'm seeing is tomorrow morning, between 8 and 12. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean, I guess I don't have a choice. But can't you, like, fix it from your end or something?

Agent: I wish I could. Unfortunately, without the modem getting a signal, I can't really do much from here. It's looking like a hardware issue or a line issue, and that requires someone to physically check it out.

Customer: (sighs) Alright, fine. Tomorrow morning.

Agent: Great. Before we schedule that, let me try one more thing if you don't mind. Let me just... (typing sounds) ...reboot your modem from my end here and see if that kicks anything into gear.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Is it doing anything?

Agent: (pause) It should be rebooting. You should see it cycle through the lights.

Customer: (pause) Nope, still the same.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, unfortunately nothing's changing on my end either. Okay, so I'm definitely going to get a technician scheduled for you. Let me just confirm—is tomorrow morning between 8 and noon still good?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. And just to cover my bases, can I get you a phone number where they can reach you if they need to?

Customer: It's the same number, 555-0147.

Agent: Okay, I've got that. So your technician will be out tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. You should get a confirmation text and email shortly. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: I don't think so. But like, what if it's just the modem? Do I have to pay for a new one?

Agent: If it's equipment failure, that's covered under your service agreement, so no charge. If it's something else, the technician will let you know. But we'll get it sorted out.

Customer: Okay, thanks I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry you're experiencing this, James. A technician will have you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, thanks for calling Frontier. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
