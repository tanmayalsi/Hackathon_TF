Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just completely went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've got work stuff I need to do and I'm kind of freaking out here.

Agent: I understand, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account real quick so we can get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I'm showing your account under Michael Torres, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage as of about an hour ago. Have you done any troubleshooting yet, like restarting your modem or router?

Customer: Um, I restarted the router, yeah. I unplugged it for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in, but nothing changed. Still no internet.

Agent: Okay, that's a good first step. Let me ask you this—when you say the internet is out, what exactly are you seeing? Is the modem showing any lights at all?

Customer: Yeah, so the modem has... it's got the power light on, that's green. But the internet light—I think it's supposed to be green, right?—it's red. Like a solid red light.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's helpful information. So the red light on the internet port typically indicates that there's either a connectivity issue on our end or there's a problem with the line coming into your home. Let me run a quick line test from my system here. (typing sounds) Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Sure, yeah, no problem.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm not detecting any outages in your area, and the line is actually showing as active on our end. That's interesting. So the issue might be with the modem itself or possibly with the equipment inside your home. Do you happen to have the model number of your modem handy?

Customer: Uh, let me look... it's a... Frontier model something. I'm not sure of the exact number. It's the white box they installed when I signed up, like two years ago.

Agent: No problem. You know what, let's try a factory reset on the modem. That sometimes clears up these kinds of issues. To do that, you're gonna look on the back of the modem for a small recessed button usually labeled "Reset." You might need a paperclip or a ballpoint pen to press it.

Customer: Okay, I'm looking... yeah, I see it. It's right here. So I just... press it?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Hold it down for about ten seconds. The modem will shut down and restart. It'll take maybe two to three minutes to fully boot back up, so just give it a few minutes and then check if those lights come back green.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... and yeah, all the lights just went off.

Agent: Perfect. That's what we want to see. Just let it sit for a couple minutes and I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Okay, I'm watching it now. The lights are starting to come back on... green power light... and the internet light is... oh. It's still red.

Agent: (pause) Still red, okay. Hmm. Let me think about this for a moment. (typing sounds) Can you tell me—have there been any recent storms in your area? Sometimes that can affect the line coming into the house.

Customer: There was actually some rain yesterday, but nothing crazy. I mean, it wasn't really storming or anything.

Agent: Gotcha. Well, sometimes even light weather can cause temporary issues. Let me ask you this—do you see any loose cables or anything that looks obviously disconnected anywhere on your modem or near where it's plugged in?

Customer: (pause) I don't see anything obviously disconnected, but... hold on, let me check the cable that goes into the wall. (pause) No, it looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Okay, good. Let me try one more thing. This is gonna sound odd, but can you unplug the modem completely, wait about thirty seconds—this time a full thirty seconds—and then plug it back in? And this time, let's see if we get a different result.

Customer: Sure, I can try that. (pause, sound of cord unplugging) Okay, waiting here... (pause) ...and plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Let's give it about three to four minutes to fully restart this time.

Customer: (pause) This is frustrating. I really need this working. My boss is gonna wonder where I am.

Agent: I totally understand. We'll get through this. (pause) Okay, how are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Same thing. Power is green, but the internet light is still... it's still red.

Agent: (pause) Alright. So we've tried the basic troubleshooting and that's not helping. At this point, it sounds like there might be a line issue on our side or possibly the modem hardware itself is failing. I'm gonna need to get a technician out to your place to do a physical inspection of the line and the equipment.

Customer: How long is that gonna take? When can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) I'm looking at our tech schedule here... We've got availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have an afternoon slot between 1 and 5 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I need my internet today. Is there any way to get someone out today?

Agent: (pause) I understand the urgency. Let me check if we have any same-day emergency slots. (typing sounds) Unfortunately, our technicians are fully booked for today. The earliest I can get someone out is tomorrow morning. I'm really sorry about that.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, fine. Tomorrow morning then. What do I need to do in the meantime?

Agent: Just leave everything as it is. Don't do any more resets or unplugging. Our technician will be able to diagnose exactly what's going on when they arrive. Can I get a contact number to confirm the appointment?

Customer: It's 555-0147, the same one.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) So I'm scheduling a technician for tomorrow, August 15th, between 8 AM and 12 PM at your address on file. You'll get a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I mean, this isn't ideal, but... thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: I appreciate your patience today. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. Our technician will absolutely get you back online tomorrow. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow morning. Have a good day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
