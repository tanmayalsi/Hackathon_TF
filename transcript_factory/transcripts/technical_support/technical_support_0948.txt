Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got my router, and it's just... nothing's working.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick and we'll see what we can do. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. And what's the best number to reach you at if we get disconnected?

Customer: It's the same number, 555-0147.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have there been any storms in your area, or did anything unusual happen before it stopped working?

Customer: No, no storms or anything. It was just working fine this morning, and then around... I dunno, 2 o'clock or so, I just noticed everything stopped. My phone's running out of data and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I understand. Okay, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what you're seeing on your modem and router right now? Are there any lights on them?

Customer: Um, yeah. So the modem, it's got... (pause) ...the power light is on, but I think the internet light is red or orange? And then the router's... I don't know, it looks like it's got some lights, but I'm not sure which is which.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the power is on, which is good. That orange or red light on the modem typically means there's no connection coming in. Have you tried unplugging everything and doing a restart yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, definitely. That usually fixes a lot of issues. Go ahead and unplug the modem—that's the bigger box—and then unplug the router as well if you could.

Customer: Okay, (pause) ...unplugging now. Just give me a second. (pause) Alright, they're both unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now just leave them unplugged for about 30 seconds or so. While we wait, how long have you been a customer with Frontier?

Customer: Oh, um, about three years now, I think? Maybe a little less. The service has been pretty good until now.

Agent: That's good to hear. Well, we'll get you back up and running. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) ...And it's booting up. I can see some lights doing things.

Agent: Great. Give it about a minute to fully boot, and then plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, that's probably about a minute. Plugging the router in now. (pause) Okay, it's back on.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give them both another minute to fully connect and sync up.

Customer: (pause) Yeah... (pause) I'm looking at it. The modem still has that orange light on the internet port.

Agent: Hmm, that's not ideal. Okay, um... let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area, and your account looks active. Can you do me a favor and check if there's a coax cable—that's the thick cable that looks like it screws on—connected to the back of your modem?

Customer: (pause) The coax cable? Um, yeah, I see it. It's... it's plugged in, I think.

Agent: Is it screwed on fairly tight, or does it look like it might be loose?

Customer: I mean, I don't really know if it's tight or loose. It looks like it's connected?

Agent: Okay, can you try unscrewing it just a little bit and then screwing it back in? Make sure it's nice and snug.

Customer: Sure, let me try that. (pause) Okay, I unscrewed it and... (pause) ...yeah, I'm screwing it back in. Think that might be it?

Agent: Possibly. We see that a lot actually—sometimes cables can come a bit loose and cause connection issues. Give it just a second to reconnect.

Customer: (pause) ...No, that didn't work. The light's still orange.

Agent: Alright, let me try something else here. Are you able to access your modem's settings? Do you happen to know the IP address or...?

Customer: I mean... I don't really know how to do that? Like, do I go into a browser or something?

Agent: Yeah, exactly. If you have a computer or laptop nearby, you could try going to 192.168.0.1 in the address bar, but don't worry if that feels too technical. Let me instead try to restart your modem from my end.

Customer: Oh, okay. Yeah, that would be easier for me.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me just... okay, I'm going to restart it now. It should take about a minute or two.

Customer: Okay. (pause) I'm... I'm just watching it. (pause) ...Yeah, it's still doing the same thing. The lights are cycling but that orange light's still there.

Agent: Okay, I see the modem's restarted on my end. The connection should be back... (pause) ...but I'm still not seeing a signal coming through to us. That's unusual.

Customer: So like, what does that mean? Is it something on my end or your end?

Agent: Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out. The fact that the orange light is still showing on your modem suggests that either we're not sending a signal to you, or there's a problem with the modem itself not picking up the signal. 

Customer: Okay... so what do we do?

Agent: (pause) Honestly, this might be something we need to have a technician look at in person. Do you happen to see any damage to the cables coming into your house, or any equipment outside that might've gotten hit or something?

Customer: I... I don't really go outside much. I'm not sure. (pause) No, I don't think so. Everything looks fine from what I can see.

Agent: Alright. Let me check our availability real quick. (typing sounds) Okay, so the earliest I can get someone out to your place is... looks like Friday. Would that work for you?

Customer: Friday? That's three days away. Isn't there anything sooner?

Agent: I'm really sorry. We do have some emergency slots, but it looks like today and tomorrow are completely booked. Friday's the soonest opening I have. I can put a note in your file to flag this as urgent if that helps.

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, I guess Friday works. I just... I don't have internet at home, so I'm gonna have to figure something out.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm really sorry about that. Let me get you scheduled for Friday. Can you be home in the morning, or would afternoon work better?

Customer: Morning is probably better.

Agent: Great. So I'm going to schedule you for a technician visit on Friday morning, between 8 AM and 12 PM. Is that window okay?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Perfect. You should get a confirmation email or text within the next couple hours, and a technician will give you a call about 30 minutes before they arrive. Your reference number is 447892.

Customer: Okay, got it. Reference number 447892.

Agent: Exactly. And is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I guess I'll just... wait until Friday.

Agent: I really do apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. But our technician will get you back up and running on Friday. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Alright, thanks Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
