Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been trying to figure it out all day. It's just completely down. Nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's, uh... (pause) 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Okay, I'm seeing your account here. It looks like you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So when did you first notice the internet went out?

Customer: This morning around, I don't know, 8 or 9 AM? I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing. Just nothing.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm, none of your devices are connecting to the internet right now? Like, not even your phone on Wi-Fi?

Customer: Right, nothing. The Wi-Fi isn't showing up at all, and I can't get anything to work. I'm actually calling you from my cell phone on data.

Agent: Got it. Okay, let's start with the basics. Can you walk me over to your modem and router? Do you know where they're located?

Customer: Yeah, yeah. They're in my living room on the entertainment center. Should I be looking at anything specific?

Agent: Yes, perfect. What I need you to do is look at the lights on the front of your modem. Are there any lights on right now? Are they lit up at all?

Customer: (pause) Um... let me see. (sounds of movement) Okay, so the modem is... there's like one light that's kind of orange or amber colored, and it's blinking. The rest are dark.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. And how about the router? Do you see lights on the router?

Customer: The router? It looks completely dead. No lights on it at all.

Agent: Alright. So the modem has one orange light blinking, and the router has no lights. That tells me we might have a power issue or possibly a connection issue at the modem level. Let me ask you this—do you see power cords plugged into both devices?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, they're both plugged in. The outlet's... (sounds of checking) Yeah, the outlet's working fine because my TV is plugged into the same outlet and that's on.

Agent: Good, that's good information. So let's try a couple things. First, I want you to unplug the modem. Just pull the power cable right out of the back.

Customer: Okay, doing that now.

Agent: Good. Now leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds. I know it might seem like we're just waiting around, but this actually helps reset the modem and clear out any errors it might have.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. (another pause) Okay, 30 seconds are up.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about a minute or two for it to fully boot back up. While we're waiting, let me ask—have you had any storms in your area recently? Or any kind of power outages?

Customer: Oh, actually, yeah. There was a pretty bad thunderstorm last night. Really intense. Why?

Agent: That could be it. Sometimes power surges from storms can damage the modem or router. Okay, what are you seeing on the modem now?

Customer: (pause) Um, same thing. Still that orange blinking light. Nothing else.

Agent: Still just the one orange light, huh? Okay. Let me try one more thing. Do you have a cord that goes from the wall outlet into the modem? Like, that's separate from the power cable?

Customer: You mean like the internet cable?

Agent: Yes, exactly. The coaxial cable—it looks kind of like a TV cable.

Customer: Oh, okay, yeah. There's definitely a cable going from the wall into the modem. It looks... (pause) ...it looks fine. It's connected.

Agent: Alright. And is there a light on the modem that indicates internet signal? Sometimes there's one labeled "Online" or "Internet" that would light up if the signal is coming through from the wall?

Customer: (pause) I mean, looking at it, I don't think any of the lights are lit up except for that orange one that's blinking. Nothing that says "Online."

Agent: Okay, I see. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm. (another pause) Mr... I'm looking at your line here, and actually I'm not seeing any signal coming into your modem from our network. That could mean a couple things—either there's an issue with the connection from the street to your house, or there's potentially a problem on our network infrastructure in your area.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Let me see what I can find out. (pause) Do you have a coaxial cable splitter anywhere? Like, if other things in your house use that line—

Customer: A what?

Agent: A splitter. It's a small device that looks kind of like... (pause) ...well, it would be where the cable from the wall splits to go to multiple devices. Do you have TV service through Frontier as well?

Customer: Oh, no. Just the internet.

Agent: Okay, so there shouldn't be a splitter then. Let me just... (typing sounds) (longer pause) I'm going to try a couple things remotely to see if I can get the modem to re-establish the connection.

Customer: Okay, doing anything I need to do?

Agent: No, just keep an eye on the modem. Tell me if you see any changes in the lights or anything at all.

Customer: (pause) ...Still orange. Nothing's changed.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I tried sending a signal but I'm still not detecting any response from the modem. At this point, what I'm seeing is that we're not getting any signal coming from our side into your home. This is typically something that would require a technician visit to diagnose properly.

Customer: You mean someone has to come out here?

Agent: I'm afraid so. It could be something in your line, something with the equipment, or even something on our end, but a tech would need to physically check it all out. Do you have availability... let me see... (typing sounds) ...we have some openings. We could get someone out to you as early as tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or—

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't you just... I don't know, reset it from there or something?

Agent: I understand the frustration. I've actually tried to reset your modem remotely, and I'm still not detecting any connection. At this point, there's really not much more I can troubleshoot over the phone. It's most likely a physical issue with the line or the equipment that needs hands-on attention.

Customer: (sighs) Alright, I guess... I guess that's fine. Tomorrow between 1 and 5?

Agent: Yes. (typing sounds) I'm getting you scheduled with our technician team. Your appointment is tomorrow, Friday, between 1 PM and 5 PM. Is there a phone number the tech can call you at?

Customer: Yeah, it's the number I called from—555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And just so you know, if the issue is something that requires equipment replacement or if it's something on our infrastructure, that may be covered under your service agreement. The tech will let you know when they arrive.

Customer: Okay. So is there... is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: You know what, let's try one more thing, actually. Can you try unplugging the router as well? Just leave everything powered down for like five minutes and then plug it all back in the same order. Power the modem first, wait for it to fully boot up, then power the router.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'll do that now. Unplug the router... (sounds of activity) ...and unplugging the modem. Let me just wait here...

Agent: (pause) Alright, take your time.

Customer: (after about 30 seconds) ...Okay, I plugged the modem back in. I'm looking at it now and... (pause) ...still the same. Just that orange light.

Agent: Yeah, I suspected as much. Go ahead and plug the router back in as well.

Customer: (sounds of plugging) Okay, router's in. (pause) Nope, nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, I think we've done everything we can from here. Your technician appointment is set for tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. They'll be able to investigate the line and get your service restored. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. Hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today, but I'm confident our tech team will get you sorted out. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with your appointment details. If you have any questions before tomorrow, you can always call back. Thanks for being a Frontier customer.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day.
