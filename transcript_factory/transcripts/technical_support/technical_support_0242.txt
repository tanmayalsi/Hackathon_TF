Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what name is the account under?

Customer: It's under Marcus Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Marcus. I've got your account pulled up here. I see you're on our Frontier Fiber 500 plan in the Phoenix area. So your internet went down this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, around 8 AM maybe? I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing. Just completely dead.

Agent: Alright, let's figure this out. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is there any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...let me go look at it. It's in the bedroom. (sound of footsteps)

Agent: Sure, take your time.

Customer: Okay, so I'm looking at it now. The modem, I think... there's a red light on it. Just one red light.

Agent: Okay, so just the power light is on and it's red?

Customer: Yeah, it's red. And then the router next to it, I don't see any lights on that at all, actually.

Agent: Okay, that makes sense. The red light on the modem typically means there's no connection coming in. Have you checked to see if there's any physical damage to the cables? Sometimes a pet or someone can accidentally kick them loose.

Customer: Let me see... (pause) ...no, I don't... the cables look fine to me. They're plugged in.

Agent: Good. And just to confirm, you're not in an area where there's been any construction work or outages that you're aware of?

Customer: No, not that I know of. Everything seemed fine yesterday.

Agent: Alright. Let me check our system here to see if there are any service alerts in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any active outages on our end. Let's try a couple of things. Can you unplug the modem for about 30 seconds? Just pull the power cord out.

Customer: Yep, doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just let it sit there for about 30 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been about 30 seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (sound of plug inserting) Alright, it's plugged back in. (pause) Um... the light's still red though.

Agent: Okay, that's... that's interesting. Give it maybe another minute or so to boot back up. Sometimes it takes a moment.

Customer: Yeah, I'll wait. (longer pause) Nope, still red. Just that one red light.

Agent: Alright, let's try something else. Can you check the coaxial cable? That's the cable that comes from the wall into your modem. Can you unplug that from the back of the modem and just look at it?

Customer: The one that looks like... like a TV cable?

Agent: Exactly, yes.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I see it. It looks... I don't know, it looks normal to me. No kinks or anything.

Agent: Good. Try unplugging it from the modem and then plugging it back in to make sure it's seated properly.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: And that didn't change anything with the light?

Customer: No, still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay, Marcus, I'm going to be honest with you, that red light usually indicates that the modem isn't detecting a signal from our network. There are a couple of possibilities here. It could be an issue on our end with the line, or it could be an equipment issue. Can you tell me... is your modem the one we provided to you, or did you purchase your own?

Customer: No, it's the one you guys gave me. Well, Frontier gave me, I guess.

Agent: Right. Okay, so here's what I'd like to do. I'm going to send a test signal through the line to see if we're getting any response. Just bear with me for one second. (typing sounds) (pause) [inaudible] Yeah, so I'm not getting a ping back. That suggests the issue might be on the network side. When was the last time your internet was working normally?

Customer: Yesterday evening, probably around 7 PM or so. Everything was working fine.

Agent: And you didn't notice anything unusual? No outages or service interruptions yesterday?

Customer: No, nothing. It was totally normal.

Agent: Alright. I think what we're dealing with here might be a line issue or possibly a problem with the modem itself. I have a couple of options for you. One, I can dispatch a technician to come out and check the equipment and the line. That would probably be the best way to diagnose this properly. Or, we could attempt a factory reset of the modem, but... I have to be honest, the lack of signal detection is making me think it's not going to help.

Customer: How long would a technician take to get out here?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) So our next available appointment would be... tomorrow between 2 and 6 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Ugh, tomorrow? I really needed this working today. I work from home and... this is kind of a problem.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry. I wish I had something sooner. Let me see if there's any possibility of getting someone out today. (pause) Unfortunately, our technicians are fully booked for the rest of the day. Tomorrow is the earliest we can get someone there.

Customer: (sigh) Can we at least try the reset thing? Maybe it'll help.

Agent: Sure, absolutely. It's worth a shot. Let me walk you through it. On the back of your modem, there should be a small reset button. It might be recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something thin to press it.

Customer: Okay, let me... (pause) ...yeah, I see it. I'm getting a paperclip.

Agent: Great. So you're going to hold down that reset button for about 10 to 15 seconds, and that'll restore the modem to factory settings.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm pressing it... (longer pause) ...and holding... alright, I'm letting go.

Agent: Okay, now give it about 2 to 3 minutes to reboot. This might take a bit longer than the power cycle.

Customer: (very long pause) Still waiting...

Agent: Take your time. While we're waiting, let me just double-check something on your account. (typing sounds)

Customer: Okay, I'm just watching it now... (pause) ...nope. Still just that red light.

Agent: Still the red light?

Customer: Yeah, nothing's changed.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so unfortunately that didn't do it. I think we're definitely looking at either a line issue or a hardware failure with the modem itself. At this point, I really think the technician visit is the best option. They can test the line, check all the connections outside, and bring a replacement modem if needed.

Customer: So tomorrow's really the only option?

Agent: Let me just... let me double-check one more time if there's any emergency availability. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing anything, I'm sorry. Tomorrow 2 to 6 PM is our earliest. I can set that up for you right now if you'd like.

Customer: Yeah, fine. Go ahead and schedule it.

Agent: Alright, I'm going to get that scheduled for you. Just to confirm, this is for the address on file at [inaudible]? Is that still correct?

Customer: Yep, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, between 2 and 6 PM. A technician will be coming out to your residence. You should get a call from them a few hours before they arrive to confirm they're on their way. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I'm just... frustrated, you know? I really needed this working.

Agent: I completely understand, Marcus. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. But I'm confident our technician will be able to get to the bottom of it tomorrow. In the meantime, if you notice anything else or if it miraculously comes back on, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Yeah, you too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
