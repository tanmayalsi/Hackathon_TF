Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. Um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for a few hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll see what we can do. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Kowalski. K-O-W-A-L-S-K-I.

Agent: Perfect, James. Thanks for that. Alright, so I'm seeing your account here. You're on our Fiber 500 plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right. I don't really know the speeds off the top of my head, but yeah.

Agent: No problem. Okay, so let me ask you this first—when you say your internet went out, have you checked if any of the lights on your modem are on? Like, is it powered on?

Customer: Um, let me go look at it. (pause) Yeah, so I'm looking at it now. The power light is on, but... I don't think any of the other lights are on. It's kind of just sitting here dark.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The power light being on is good, but if the other lights aren't lit up, that could indicate a connection issue. Have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in yet?

Customer: No, I haven't done that. I figured I'd call first before I started messing with stuff.

Agent: That's smart, that's what I'm here for. Let me have you do that real quick. Go ahead and unplug it from the power outlet for about thirty seconds. I'll wait on the line.

Customer: (sound of movement) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) I'm just gonna count to thirty here... okay, that should be good. Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Now let's just wait about a minute or so for it to fully boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me if you experienced any storms in your area last night or this morning?

Customer: Actually, yeah. There was a pretty bad storm around like... two in the morning? Woke me up actually. Thunder, lightning, the whole thing.

Agent: Ah, okay. That could definitely be related. We sometimes see outages or equipment issues after severe weather. (pause) Are you seeing any lights coming on now on the modem?

Customer: Um... (pause) I see the power light, still just the one. The internet light or whatever should be blinking, right?

Agent: Yes, exactly. You should see like a blue or white light that indicates internet connectivity, and it should be either solid or blinking. If that's not on, then we're not getting a signal to your modem.

Customer: Yeah, it's not there.

Agent: Okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a line test from here... (pause) ...and I'm actually showing that we do have an active signal going to your address, so that's good news. The issue might be with the modem itself or there could be something with the outside equipment.

Customer: So what do we do about that?

Agent: Well, let me try a few more things first before we escalate this. Can you tell me—do you have a router connected to your modem as well, or are you just using the modem?

Customer: I have a separate router, yeah.

Agent: Okay, good. Can you also unplug that one and wait about thirty seconds?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, it's been like thirty seconds. Plugging it back in. (pause) Still just the modem power light though.

Agent: I figured. Okay, here's another thing we can try. On the modem itself, there should be a small reset button. It's usually recessed, so you might need like a paperclip or something pointy. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) The little hole on the back?

Agent: That's it exactly. If you press and hold that for about ten seconds, it'll do a factory reset of the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing it now... and... (pause) let me wait for it to boot back up. (pause) Okay, still nothing. Just the power light again.

Agent: Alright, I appreciate your patience with me here. Let me check our outage map in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm not showing any active outages in your zone, but we do have a note here from the storm last night. There was a service interruption from about 2 AM to 4 AM, but it shows as resolved.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is my stuff broken?

Agent: Not necessarily. It's possible the modem got damaged or fried during the surge, or there could be an issue with the line itself outside your house. Since we're getting a signal on our end but the modem isn't communicating back, I'm leaning toward a modem issue or external equipment.

Customer: Okay... so how do we fix that?

Agent: So we have a couple of options. I can schedule a technician to come out and check both your modem and the external equipment. They can usually get out within the next 24 to 48 hours. Or, if you want, we can ship you a replacement modem, but that could take a few business days.

Customer: [inaudible] ...I really can't wait a few days. Can you just send the tech out tomorrow?

Agent: Let me check our scheduling. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at tomorrow... we do have availability between 8 AM and 12 PM, or between 1 PM and 5 PM. Which window works better for you?

Customer: I have to work from home, so um... can they come in the afternoon? Like the 1 to 5 window?

Agent: Absolutely, that works. Let me just confirm your address real quick to make sure the technician shows up at the right place. I have it as 247 Maple Street, Apartment 3B, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And a phone number where they can reach you?

Customer: Same number I called with should be fine.

Agent: Great. So just to recap, we have a technician scheduled for tomorrow, [inaudible] between 1 and 5 PM. They'll assess both the modem and the outside line. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I think that's... I mean, I'm frustrated that we couldn't just fix it today, but I get it. Tomorrow works.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone. You're going to get this fixed tomorrow, and if there's any issue with the service call, you just give us a call back. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Alright, thanks Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Thanks for being patient, and we'll see you tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
