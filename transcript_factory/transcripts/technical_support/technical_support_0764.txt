# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet is down. It's not working at all, and I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I understand. That's definitely frustrating. Let me help you out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one second here. Got it. So I'm showing an account under James Mitchell at 842 Clearview Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you're saying you have no internet connection at all right now?

Customer: Right. Nothing. All the lights on my modem and router are... I mean, they're not lit up. Well, the power light is on, but that's it.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So the modem has power, but no lights showing activity. Let me walk you through a few quick troubleshooting steps. First, can you locate your modem for me?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's in my office closet.

Agent: Great. I want you to unplug the power cable from the back of the modem. Just pull it straight out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds. This will help reset the device.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm waiting... (pause) Okay, it's been like thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now plug it back in and let's see what happens. The lights should start cycling through as it boots up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in... (pause) Hmm. The power light came back on, but... I'm not seeing any of the other lights. Usually there's like a blue light and a green light?

Agent: Right, those are your internet and broadband lights. So we're not seeing activity there. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your modem status here, and it actually does show that you're connected to our network. That's... that's a little odd.

Customer: Wait, it says I'm connected? Because I definitely don't have internet. Like, I tried opening a webpage and nothing happened.

Agent: Yeah, let me have you try something. Can you unplug your router as well? Sometimes the issue is with the router rather than the modem.

Customer: The router? That's the wireless thing, right?

Agent: Exactly. Yes.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause) Where did I... oh, there it is. (pause) Okay, unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. Let's give that the same treatment. About thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay. (pause) Alright, I'm plugging it back in.

(pause)

Customer: Same thing. The power light is on, but no other lights.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Let me ask you this—are you seeing any lights on the modem itself? Not the router, just the modem?

Customer: On the modem? Let me look closer. (pause) No, like I said, just the power light. That's all that's on.

Agent: I understand. You know what, I want to check a couple things on my end. Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

(pause with hold music)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So I did see a signal drop on your line at about 8:47 this morning. That would've been right when your issue likely started. I'm showing a service alert in your area.

Customer: A service alert? Does that mean there's something wrong with your network?

Agent: It could be a few things. We might have maintenance happening, or there could be a line issue in the neighborhood. Let me run a line test on your connection here. (typing sounds)

Customer: How long will that take?

Agent: Just a moment. (pause) Okay, the test completed and it's showing a weak signal on your line. That could be the culprit here. Now, I want to try one more thing before we move forward, and that's to check your connections physically.

Customer: My connections?

Agent: Yes. Can you trace the cable coming from outside your house into your modem? I want to make sure it's firmly connected.

Customer: Oh, okay. So I have to crawl back there? (pause) Alright, give me a second. (background noise of movement) Okay, I can see it. The cable is in the back of the modem.

Agent: Good. Is it screwed in all the way or does it look loose at all?

Customer: (pause) It looks pretty tight to me. I mean, I don't think I could... (pause) No, it seems fine.

Agent: Okay, try giving it one gentle clockwise turn just to make sure it's as tight as it can be.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) That's about as far as I can turn it. Did that help? Should I be seeing lights yet?

Agent: Not immediately. Let me do another quick check on my end. (typing sounds) I'm running another diagnostics scan... (pause) Still showing that weak signal. Unfortunately, I think this might be something on our end with the line infrastructure in your area, or there could be a problem with the connection point outside your house.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, when will it be fixed?

Agent: That's a great question. Typically, if it's a service alert in the area, our maintenance team is already working on it. But if it's an issue specific to your line, I would need to schedule a technician to come out and inspect the external connections and the line itself.

Customer: How long would that take? And would I have to wait around all day?

Agent: A technician visit would likely be within the next two to three business days. And yes, you would need to be home during the appointment window, which is usually a four-hour window.

Customer: (frustrated) Two to three days? I need my internet working today. I have conference calls scheduled this afternoon.

Agent: I completely understand how frustrating that is. Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) Let me check if we have any same-day appointments available. (pause) Unfortunately, it looks like our technicians are pretty booked up today, but I could put you on a list for a call back if someone has a cancellation.

Customer: That's... that's not really ideal, but I guess I don't have much choice. Yeah, go ahead.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to make that note on your account. You should expect to hear from us within the next couple hours if a slot opens up. In the meantime, is there anything else I can try on my end to get you reconnected?

Customer: I don't know. Can you try resetting it again or something?

Agent: We can, absolutely. Let me try a remote reset of your modem. This is different from the power reset you did. (typing sounds) Okay, initiating the reset now. This should take about a minute or two for the modem to restart completely.

(pause)

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it... (pause) The power light went out for a second, and now it's back on. But... nope. Still just the power light. No other lights.

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately that's not helping. At this point, with the weak signal reading and the service alert, I think we really do need to get a technician out there to diagnose the issue properly. I've noted your account for same-day priority, and you should expect a call within the next couple hours.

Customer: Alright. Well, what if nobody calls me? What do I do?

Agent: Good question. If you don't hear from us by, let's say, 2 PM, you can call us back and reference your ticket number. Let me give you that. Your ticket number is 4-7-2-9-1-8-8.

Customer: (pause) Okay, 4729188.

Agent: That's correct. And your case notes show that you're working from home, so we know this is time-sensitive. We will definitely try our best to get someone out to you today.

Customer: Okay. Well, I guess that's all we can do. I'm not happy about this, but I appreciate you trying.

Agent: I really do apologize for the inconvenience. This isn't the experience we want for our customers. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I hope this gets resolved soon.

Agent: I hope so too. Again, if you don't hear from us, call back with that ticket number. We have it all on file. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and sorry again for the trouble today.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
