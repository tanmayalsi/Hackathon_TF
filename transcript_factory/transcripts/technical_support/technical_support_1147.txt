# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, so I'm having issues with my internet. It's just... it's completely down. I can't get online at all.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I see your account here. And when did you first notice the internet wasn't working?

Customer: This morning, I'd say around nine o'clock? I tried to check my email and nothing was loading. I rebooted the router, unplugged it, waited a few minutes, plugged it back in, but still nothing.

Agent: Okay, okay. Those are usually good first steps. Good thinking on that. So the router is back powered on now, correct?

Customer: Yeah, it's on right now.

Agent: Great. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on the modem? Are any of them lit up or blinking?

Customer: (pause) Uh, let me look at it. So I see a... there's a blue light that's solid, and then there's like a yellow one that's blinking.

Agent: Yellow blinking, okay. And just to confirm—the model of your modem should be printed on a sticker. Can you check if it says FX-something?

Customer: Let me see... FX-2500. Yeah, that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so that yellow light typically indicates the modem is trying to connect but hasn't synced with our network yet. Have you had any weather issues in your area? Sometimes that can affect the connection.

Customer: Hmm, it rained pretty heavy last night, now that you mention it. There was some thunder and lightning.

Agent: That could definitely be it. Okay, so here's what I'd like to try. Can you unplug the modem for about two minutes this time? Not just thirty seconds—a full two minutes.

Customer: Alright, unplugging it now.

Agent: (pause) Perfect. While we wait, I'm just going to check the line status on your account. (typing sounds) Looks like we're showing some signal degradation on your line. That could be storm-related, yeah.

Customer: So that's the problem then?

Agent: It very well could be. Let's give the modem those two minutes and then plug it back in. That'll force a hard reset and might help it re-establish the connection.

Customer: Okay, it's been about two minutes. Plugging it back in now. (pause) Alright, it's booting up.

Agent: Great. While it boots up, you should see that blue light stay solid and then the yellow light should start blinking.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that's... that's what I'm seeing right now. Blue is solid, yellow is blinking.

Agent: Okay, so it's initializing. This can take a few minutes sometimes. While we're waiting, let me actually run a line test on our end to see if we're detecting any signal from your location.

Customer: Sure.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Hmm... I'm getting some inconsistent readings here. I'm not detecting a stable signal. Let me check with our network team if there are any known issues in your area. (brief hold music)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. I'm not seeing any widespread outages, but I am seeing that we had some issues in your neighborhood early this morning around 6 AM. Those should've been resolved, but it's possible your line wasn't fully restored. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, when will it be fixed?

Agent: Well, let me try a couple more things remotely first before we escalate this. Can you do me a favor and check if there's a power cable plugged into the back of the modem that might've come loose during the storm?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... No, it looks pretty solid to me.

Agent: Okay, and the coax cable—that's the TV-type cable connecting to the modem—is that plugged in tight?

Customer: Yeah, that looks fine too. Both cables seem good.

Agent: Alright. Can you restart the modem one more time? So that's a hard reset again. Unplug it for about thirty seconds this time.

Customer: (pause) Unplugging now... (pause) Okay, plugging back in.

Agent: Perfect. And while that's rebooting, I'm going to try to send a refresh signal from our end to your modem. (typing sounds) Done. Let's see if that helps.

Customer: (pause) Still the same thing. Blue light is solid, yellow is blinking.

Agent: The yellow is still blinking? It should've turned solid by now if the refresh worked. (pause) That... that tells me the issue is likely on our end with the signal getting to your home. I'm not able to get a stable connection established.

Customer: So you can't fix it from there?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. At this point, we'd need to send a technician out to your location to check the lines and equipment. This could be something with the connection from our distribution point to your home, or there could be damage from the storm to the line running to your house.

Customer: Great. (sighs) How long until someone can come out?

Agent: Let me check availability. (typing sounds) So I'm seeing that we have technicians available tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have another window on Thursday afternoon from 1 PM to 5 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works better for me.

Agent: Perfect. I'll get you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 and 12. The technician will call you thirty minutes before they arrive. Is the best number to reach you 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Excellent. So to recap, you've got a service call tomorrow morning, and I do apologize that we couldn't resolve this over the phone. The good news is our technician will get to the bottom of this and get you back online.

Customer: Okay. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Your confirmation number is FRN-887432. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright. Thanks for calling Frontier, and sorry again for the inconvenience.

Customer: Yeah, no problem. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
