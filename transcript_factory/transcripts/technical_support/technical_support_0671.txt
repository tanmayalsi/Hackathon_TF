Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm really frustrated because I've got work to do from home.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's under Michael Torres.

Agent: Perfect, thank you Michael. Alright, so you're experiencing no internet connection at all this morning. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing. The modem's... I don't know, it's just not working.

Agent: Okay, I can definitely help you troubleshoot this. First, let me ask—do you have a Frontier modem and router, or do you have your own equipment?

Customer: No, it's yours. The Frontier one. It's been working fine up until today.

Agent: Alright, perfect. So what I'd like you to do is take a look at the modem right now. Can you tell me what color lights you're seeing on the front of it?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm walking over there now. (background noise of footsteps) Um... there's a red light. Just one red light on the top.

Agent: Just one red light?

Customer: Yeah. Everything else is dark.

Agent: Okay, so that red light typically indicates there's no connection coming in from our network. Let me check something on my end first. (typing sounds) I'm running a diagnostic on your line right now... (pause) Hmm, it looks like we are showing a connection on our end, so the issue might be with the modem or the equipment itself.

Customer: Oh no. So what does that mean?

Agent: Let me walk you through a few troubleshooting steps and we should be able to get you back online. First, can you unplug the modem from the power outlet? Just pull the cord out.

Customer: Yeah, doing that now.

Agent: Great. And while that's unplugged, I need you to count to thirty. Just give it a good reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay... thirty seconds, right? One... two... three...

Agent: You got it.

Customer: ...twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged it back in. (pause) Now what?

Agent: Now we're just going to let it boot back up. That usually takes about two to three minutes. While that's happening, can you also check the cable connection in the back of the modem? Make sure the coax cable—that's the cable that comes from the wall—is screwed in nice and tight.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, let me... yeah, the cable's connected. It looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Alright, good. How are those lights looking now? Any changes?

Customer: (pause) Um, I'm seeing some lights now. There's green, I think? And... yeah, there's like a blinking light too.

Agent: Okay, that's a good sign. The blinking light is the modem communicating. Can you give it another minute or so and tell me when that blinking light stops?

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I'm watching it. (longer pause) Okay, it... it stopped blinking. But the lights aren't looking right. The green light went away and now I'm back to just seeing one red light again.

Agent: (pause) Hmm, that's odd. Okay, let me check the diagnostics again. (typing sounds) (pause) Michael, I'm still seeing that we have a signal coming to your location, but it sounds like the modem might not be recognizing it. Let me try something else. Can you check if there are any other cables connected to the modem? Sometimes if the backup battery cable gets loose, it can cause issues.

Customer: Uh... (pause) I don't see anything else. Just the power cord and the cable from the wall.

Agent: Okay, and you're sure that coax cable is screwed in all the way? Sometimes it just needs a little extra turn.

Customer: (grunt) Let me try tightening it more. (pause) There, I twisted it a bit more. Let me see if... (pause) No, same thing. Still just that red light.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Um, let me check your modem's serial number. That's usually on the back of the unit. Can you read that for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... FR-4892-XL.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so that model is... (pause) Let me see here. That one's a couple years old now. You know what, I'm going to try one more thing. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem from our system here. It might take a minute or two.

Customer: Okay, yeah, do that.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I've sent that reset. Can you tell me if anything changes on the modem?

Customer: (pause) Hmm... nope. Same red light. It's not changing.

Agent: [inaudible]... let me check this. (pause) Michael, I'm not seeing the modem respond to that signal, which tells me there might be a hardware issue with the unit itself. It could be the modem's gone bad.

Customer: Are you serious? It was working fine yesterday.

Agent: I understand. Sometimes these things just fail without warning. What I'd like to do is get you a replacement modem sent out. It would typically arrive within three to five business days. In the meantime, I'm going to have to let you know that I don't think we're going to be able to get this particular unit back online.

Customer: Three to five days? That's... that's a really long time. Do you have any other options? Can someone come out today?

Agent: (pause) Let me check what we have available for same-day appointments. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm looking at the schedule for your area and unfortunately, it looks like our earliest available appointment would be tomorrow afternoon. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon is better than five days, yeah. What time are we talking?

Agent: Let me see... we have a window between 1 PM and 5 PM tomorrow. Would that time frame work?

Customer: Yeah, I can work with that. That's fine.

Agent: Great. So just to confirm, I have you down for a technician visit tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM window. The technician will bring a replacement modem and get you back online. Is that your understanding?

Customer: Yeah, that's... that's good. But what about today? I really need internet today for work.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry we don't have something sooner. One option is if you have a smartphone with a hotspot capability, you could potentially use that for today as a temporary solution. I know it's not ideal for work, but it might help bridge the gap until we get you sorted tomorrow.

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, okay. I can probably do that. So I'm all set for tomorrow then?

Agent: You are. Let me get your email on file so we can send you a confirmation. What's the best email address for you?

Customer: It's michael.torres@[inaudible].com.

Agent: Perfect. I've got that. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's it. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I really am sorry we couldn't get it working today, Michael. Hopefully the technician will get you all squared away tomorrow. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and have a good day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
