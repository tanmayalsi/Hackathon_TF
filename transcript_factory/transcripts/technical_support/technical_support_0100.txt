# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Derek. So, uh, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I need to get this fixed because I work from home.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's the same number I'm calling from. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Okay, I'm seeing your account here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you have any lights on your modem right now?

Customer: Um, yeah, let me look. It's, uh... okay, so I see the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light—the one that's usually solid blue—it's blinking orange right now.

Agent: Okay, good information. That blinking orange light typically means there's no connection to our network. Let me ask you a few questions first. Have you restarted your modem yet?

Customer: No, I haven't actually. I tried unplugging my router but I didn't try the modem itself.

Agent: Okay, let's go ahead and do that. Can you unplug the modem for about 30 seconds? Just pull the power cable right out of the back.

Customer: Sure, yeah. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: And while we're waiting, just out of curiosity—did anything change with your setup recently? New equipment, storm last night, anything like that?

Customer: Um... no, nothing that I can think of. We had some rain yesterday but nothing crazy. And no, I haven't changed anything with the equipment.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful. Go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) I'm waiting for it to boot up... okay, the lights are coming back on. The power light's green again, and... oh, the internet light is still blinking orange.

Agent: Still blinking orange. Okay. (typing sounds) Let me check a few things on our end. Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, no problem.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any service alerts in your area, and your line appears to be active on our system. But let me walk you through a few more steps. Do you see any other cables connected to your modem besides the power?

Customer: Yeah, there's a cable that comes in from outside, and then there's an Ethernet cable going to my computer.

Agent: Perfect. Can you check that outside cable—the one coming in from the wall—and make sure it's connected firmly to the back of the modem?

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me look at that. Yeah, it looks pretty tight to me, but let me... (pause) ...let me push it in a bit more, just to be sure. Oh, hold on, it actually came out a little bit. Let me reconnect it.

Agent: (pause) Okay, good catch. Go ahead and plug that back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's plugged in. Still see the blinking orange light though.

Agent: Still blinking? Okay. Let me ask—when you look at that cable connection, do you notice anything unusual about it? Any discoloration, any kinks in the cable...?

Customer: No, um... the cable looks fine to me. It's not damaged or anything.

Agent: Alright. Let me check something. (pause, typing sounds) I'm going to run a remote diagnostic on your modem, okay? This might take just a moment.

Customer: Sure.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm running the diagnostic now... (longer pause) Hmm.

Customer: What? What does that mean?

Agent: Well, the diagnostic is actually unable to connect to your modem remotely, which is consistent with what we're seeing with that orange light. Now, this could be a few different things. Let me ask you—have you recently updated your modem's firmware, or has anything else happened that you might've forgotten about?

Customer: No, like I said, nothing's changed. This just started this morning when I tried to connect.

Agent: Right, I hear you. Okay, let me try one more thing. I'm going to need you to do a factory reset on the modem. This will clear all the settings and let it reprogram itself. Are you comfortable doing that?

Customer: Um, a factory reset? Is that... will I lose anything important?

Agent: No, no—it'll just restart the modem's settings. It might take about five to ten minutes to fully reconnect to our network after that. Do you see a small reset button on the back of the modem, maybe in a little indent?

Customer: (pause) I think so? Yeah, there's a small button on the back. You want me to press it?

Agent: Yes, but you'll need something small like a paperclip or a pen to reach it. Hold it down for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me find something. (pause) Alright, I've got a pen. I'm pressing and holding the reset button... (pause) ...still holding... okay, I'm at 10 seconds now.

Agent: Perfect. Let it fully restart now. This might take a few minutes. I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: (pause) Okay, the lights are cycling through different colors right now. This is a little different than before.

Agent: That's actually normal. They're initializing now.

Customer: (longer pause) Okay, it looks like it's done. Everything's cleared and it's starting fresh. The power light is green again... (pause) ...and the internet light is... it's still blinking orange.

Agent: Still orange? (pause) Okay, um... let me pull up your account again here. (typing sounds, pause) I'm checking our network on our end. The signal is reaching your location, so... it should be coming through. (pause) 

Customer: So what does that mean? Is there something wrong with my modem?

Agent: It's possible. Or it could be something on the line side. (pause) Look, I've gone through all the troubleshooting steps I can do remotely, and we're not getting the connection to establish. At this point, I think we need to have a technician come out to your location and check the line and the equipment.

Customer: A technician? How long is that going to take? Like I said, I need internet for work today.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what I can schedule for you. (typing sounds) We have technician availability tomorrow between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., or if you can wait, Thursday morning between 8 a.m. and noon. Which works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow works better. I can take the morning off from work.

Agent: Great. So tomorrow, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Let me get that queued up for you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I've got that scheduled. Your confirmation number is 584729. The technician will come out and they'll be able to access both your external line and your modem to determine where the issue is.

Customer: Alright, so just to confirm, they're coming tomorrow between 10 and 2?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. Between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. tomorrow. They'll have your phone number on file so they should give you a call about an hour before they arrive to confirm. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I really hope so too. I apologize again for the inconvenience today. Your confirmation number again is 584729. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
