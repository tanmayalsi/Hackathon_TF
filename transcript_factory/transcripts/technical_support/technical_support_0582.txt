# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, so my internet just went out completely. I've been without service for like... I don't know, maybe twenty minutes now? And I really need it because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Uh, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Let me pull that up here... Okay, I've got your account. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Riverside area. And you're saying the internet is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. No lights on the modem, nothing. Well, actually, there might be one light, but I can't really tell.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Let's start with the basics. Can you tell me what you're seeing on your modem right now? Is it powered on? Are there any lights at all?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it now... there's like a green light on the front. But nothing else is lighting up. Usually there's like, a white light that means it's connected, right?

Agent: Right, exactly. So you should see multiple lights. The green one indicates power, which is good. Usually you'd see lights for internet connection and Wi-Fi activity. The fact that those aren't showing up suggests the modem isn't connecting to the network. Let's do a quick power cycle. Can you unplug the modem from the wall outlet for me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. While we wait, let me ask—have there been any recent storms in your area? Or any construction work happening near your home?

Customer: Uh, no storms that I'm aware of. Though there was some road work a couple blocks away yesterday. Why?

Agent: Just checking for external factors that might cause a service interruption. Okay, thirty seconds should be up. Can you go ahead and plug the modem back in?

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) Hmm, okay, so... the green light came back on, but I'm still not seeing the other lights.

Agent: Okay, let's give it about a minute to fully boot up and re-establish connection. Sometimes it takes a moment.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm... I'm still just seeing the green light. It's been like a minute and a half now.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to pull up your service status... and I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area currently. So this appears to be isolated to your equipment. Let me ask you—do you see a battery backup unit or anything attached to your modem? Anything that might be blocking the connection?

Customer: No, it's just the modem. It's sitting by the window like it normally is.

Agent: Okay. And can you check the back of the modem? I need you to look at the cable connections. Is the coaxial cable—that's the thick cable coming from the wall—is that plugged in firmly?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks like it's... wait, hold on. It actually looks like it might be a little loose. Let me... (sound of rustling) Let me push it in tighter.

Agent: Perfect. That's a really common issue, actually. Give that a firm push.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I pushed it in. And... (pause) ...still just the green light. That didn't do it.

Agent: Alright. Let me try one more thing. Can you unplug the power cable from the back of the modem this time instead of at the wall?

Customer: How come? Wouldn't it be the same thing?

Agent: (pause) Actually, that's a good point. Let me try a different approach. Let me check your modem model real quick. Can you tell me what model modem you have? There should be a label on the top or bottom.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm flipping it over... it says... Netgear Nighthawk... something. LM1200?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking up the specs on that model. (pause) Alright, so the Netgear Nighthawk does have multiple indicator lights. The absence of those lights actually concerns me. This could indicate a hardware failure. Before we go there, though, let me check one more thing. Can you tell me—are there any other outlets in your home that the modem is connected to?

Customer: What do you mean? Like... no, it's just plugged into the wall.

Agent: Right, okay. I had to ask. And have you noticed any burning smells or anything unusual around the modem?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It seems fine, it's just not... working.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I'm going to be honest with you here. Based on what you're describing, it sounds like there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself. However, I want to make absolutely sure before we move forward. I'm going to send a test signal to your modem to see if it's receiving anything on my end. Give me about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm waiting. (pause) Did it do anything? The modem didn't change.

Agent: No, I'm not getting a response from the modem on our end. That's... yeah, that's pretty indicative of a hardware failure. I'm sorry to say, but it sounds like your modem has stopped functioning properly.

Customer: Wait, really? But it was working fine this morning. I was on a video call and everything.

Agent: I understand. Sometimes these things just fail unexpectedly. It's frustrating, I know. Here's what we can do. We can either ship you a replacement modem, which typically takes three to five business days, or if you have a Frontier store location nearby, you might be able to pick one up today.

Customer: Three to five days? I need internet today. I'm supposed to have a meeting at two o'clock.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what options we have. (typing sounds) Do you have a Frontier retail location near you? We have one on Maple Street and one on Route 9.

Customer: I'm... I'm not sure. I've never been to one. Can I look that up myself?

Agent: Of course. You can find our store locator on our website. But let me be honest with you—even if you go pick up a replacement modem today, we would still need to activate it on your account, and there might be a setup fee involved depending on your plan.

Customer: Are you kidding me? There's a fee to replace a modem that's just... broken?

Agent: I know it's frustrating. What I can do is—let me apply a service credit to your account as a courtesy, and I'll expedite the modem replacement. Instead of three to five business days, I can get you expedited shipping, which should be two to three days.

Customer: Two or three days? That's still not today.

Agent: (pause) I understand your concern. Unfortunately, without the physical modem in my hands to verify it's defective, I'm limited in what I can do immediately. But I'm going to do everything I can here. Let me get that expedited replacement queued up for you and apply a credit. What's the best address for us to send the modem to?

Customer: It's the same address on the account, right? 447 Oak Ridge Drive?

Agent: Let me verify that. (typing sounds) Yes, 447 Oak Ridge Drive. Perfect. I'm going to process that expedited replacement right now. You should receive your modem within two to three business days, and there will be a credit applied to your next bill.

Customer: Okay, but... is there anything else I can do in the meantime? Like, any way to troubleshoot this further?

Agent: (pause) Well... let me think. Have you tried doing a hard reset on the modem? There's usually a small reset button on the back that you press and hold for ten seconds.

Customer: I mean, I can try, but are you sure that won't like, erase something?

Agent: It shouldn't. It will just reset the modem to factory settings. But honestly, given the symptoms you're describing, I don't think a reset is going to fix a hardware failure. But if you want to try it, it won't hurt.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, you know what, I'll give it a shot. (pause, sound of rustling) Okay, I'm pressing the reset button... (pause) ...holding it... (pause) Okay, I let go.

Agent: Give it about a minute to reboot.

Customer: (pause) Okay, now I'm waiting... (longer pause) ...nothing. Still just the green light.

Agent: (sigh) Yeah, unfortunately that confirms what I suspected. The modem isn't responding. I'm confident at this point that it's a hardware issue. The good news is that your replacement is already in the system for expedited shipping. You'll get a shipping confirmation email within the next hour, and then you should have it by Thursday at the latest.

Customer: This is really frustrating. What am I supposed to do about my work?

Agent: I totally understand. Is there anywhere else you could work from today—a coffee shop with Wi-Fi, maybe a library, or a coworker's place?

Customer: (pause) I mean... maybe. But I have a whole setup here at home. This is ridiculous.

Agent: I know it's inconvenient. And I genuinely wish I could get you back online faster. But we have you taken care of with the replacement. In the meantime, I'm also going to add a one-month service credit to your account as an apology for the inconvenience.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, well, I appreciate that, I guess.

Agent: Absolutely. So just to recap—you'll receive an expedited replacement modem within two to three business days. There's a service credit on your account. When you receive the new modem, just plug it in and it should automatically activate. If you have any issues with activation, you can call us back. Do you have any other questions for me?

Customer: No, I don't think so. Just... I really hope it arrives soon.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll do everything we can to get it to you quickly. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day, and we apologize again for the inconvenience.

Customer: Yep, bye.

Agent: Bye.
