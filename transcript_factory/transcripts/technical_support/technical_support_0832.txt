# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've got no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. And just to confirm, this is at 422 Maple Street in Henderson?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Is it completely out, or are you able to get any connection at all?

Customer: No, nothing. I've got no lights on my router, no connection. I tried unplugging it like... I don't know, ten minutes ago? Plugged it back in and still nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's actually a good first step. Let me ask you a few quick questions. When you look at your modem—that's the box where the cables come in—do you see any lights on that device?

Customer: (pause) Um... let me look. No, I don't think so. It's pretty dark.

Agent: Alright. Can you check that all the cables are plugged in securely? Sometimes they can get jostled loose, especially if you have pets or kids around.

Customer: Yeah, let me... (sounds of movement) Okay, I'm looking at it now. There's the power cable, and... yeah, that seems fine. And the coax cable is plugged in.

Agent: Good. And the ethernet cable going to your router—if you have one—is that connected as well?

Customer: Um, hold on. (pause) Okay, I just... I pushed everything in a little tighter and actually, I'm seeing a light now on the modem. A red light though. Is that... is that bad?

Agent: That's actually really good progress! A red light typically means it's trying to sync up with our network. Give it about a minute or so to boot up completely. Can you maybe grab a cup of coffee and we'll check back in just a second?

Customer: (chuckles) Sure, yeah. Okay.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm back. Any change on those lights?

Customer: Um, it's still red. I mean, maybe a little less red? I don't know, it's hard to tell.

Agent: That's okay. Actually, let me look at your account from my end here to see if there's anything I'm seeing on our network. (typing sounds) Hmm, that's interesting.

Customer: What? What is it?

Agent: Well, so it looks like your modem is actually showing as offline in our system. That's consistent with what you're seeing. Now, when's the last time you had any internet service working properly?

Customer: This morning, it was fine. I was working from home and then around... I dunno, ten o'clock, I noticed everything just went dark. I went to load a page and it just timed out.

Agent: Okay. And there haven't been any storms in your area or anything like that?

Customer: Not really. It's been pretty clear all day.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something here. I'm going to send a restart signal to your modem from our end. What you might see is the lights will go dark for maybe fifteen to thirty seconds and then come back on. You should see a white or green light if everything syncs back up. Just watch it for me.

Customer: Okay, I'm looking at it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Sending that now... and you should see the lights react pretty soon.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, yeah, they went out. Okay, they're... they're coming back on. I see red again though.

Agent: Hmm, still red. Alright, that's okay. Let me give that another minute to fully boot.

Customer: (pause) Still red, Derek.

Agent: Yeah, I'm not seeing it come online on our end either. Okay, so I want to try one more thing. Are you able to unplug the modem for about thirty seconds? Let it sit, and then plug it back in?

Customer: Yeah, already did that earlier, but... sure, I'll do it again. (sounds of movement) Unplugging now. I'll just count to thirty... (pause) ... okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Okay, keep an eye on those lights for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so it's booting back up. Going through the lights... and... it's staying red.

Agent: (long pause) I'm still showing it as offline from our end as well. Let me check something. Have you noticed any unusual activity on your account recently, or any changes to your setup?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine this morning.

Agent: Yeah, understood. Okay, so at this point, it's looking like there might be an issue with either the modem itself or possibly the line coming into your home. Since we've done the basic troubleshooting steps and the device isn't syncing to our network... I think we may need to get a technician out to your location to take a deeper look.

Customer: Really? How long would that take? I kind of need the internet back pretty soon. I'm working from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) So the earliest I'm showing is actually tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we have an afternoon slot at 1 to 5 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow? (pause) I mean, I guess the morning would be better. Can I do 8 to noon tomorrow?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. That would be tomorrow, the 15th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue with your modem and line.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Do I need to be there?

Agent: Yes, someone does need to be home to let the technician inside. They'll have their credentials with them. The visit should take about 30 to 45 minutes typically. And just so you know, if it's the modem, there's no charge for the repair or replacement, but if it turns out to be something on your end, there may be a service call fee.

Customer: Okay. So what, they might have to replace the modem?

Agent: That's possible, yes. They'll diagnose it first and let you know what needs to happen. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's... I mean, it's not ideal, but I guess that's what we gotta do.

Agent: I know it's not ideal, and I apologize for the inconvenience. We really appreciate your patience. Your confirmation number is 847562. That'll be on your account, and we'll also send you a text and email confirmation with the appointment details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome! We'll get you back up and running soon. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
