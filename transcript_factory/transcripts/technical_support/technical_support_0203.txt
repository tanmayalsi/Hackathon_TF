# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get your name?

Customer: It's Marcus. Marcus Thompson.

Agent: Perfect, Marcus. I see your account here. So your internet service went down this morning, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 AM. I was working from home and everything just stopped. The router's still on, the lights are blinking and all that, but I can't connect to anything. I've got no internet.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let me run through some quick troubleshooting steps with you. First, can you tell me... have you tried unplugging your modem and router yet?

Customer: (pause) No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, let's start there. Go ahead and unplug your modem—that's the device where the cable comes in—and just hold off on the router for a second.

Customer: (background noise of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about 30 seconds while it powers down completely.

Customer: (pause) Alright, how long has it been?

Agent: Give it another 10 seconds... okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (background noise) Done.

Agent: Great. It should take a few minutes to boot back up. While we're waiting for that, I'm gonna ask you a few more questions. Has there been any bad weather in your area recently? Any storms or anything like that?

Customer: No, actually it's been nice all week. That's the weird thing.

Agent: Okay, that rules that out. Have you noticed any loose cables or anything physically wrong with the modem or router?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) No, everything looks pretty normal to me. The cables are all plugged in tight.

Agent: Good. Are you seeing any lights on the modem now? Like a power light?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, the power light is on. And I'm seeing like... a green light next to the internet symbol.

Agent: Excellent. That's a good sign. Now go ahead and plug the router back in if you haven't already.

Customer: Okay, plugging it in now. (background noise) It's on.

Agent: Perfect. Give that a minute or two to fully power up. Can you tell me what model router you have? Is it the Frontier-branded one we provided, or...?

Customer: Um, it says "Frontier" on it, yeah. It's white.

Agent: Okay, great. That's our standard equipment. While the router's starting up, let me just verify a few things on my end. (typing sounds) I'm seeing your account is active. There's no service disruption noted in the area. Have you tried connecting to the WiFi yet, or are you still waiting on the router to fully boot?

Customer: I'm still waiting. (pause) Okay, I'm trying now... nope, nothing. I don't see the network showing up.

Agent: Hmm, let's give it another minute. Sometimes it takes a bit longer. What device are you trying to connect with? Your phone?

Customer: Yeah, my phone and my laptop. Neither one's picking anything up.

Agent: Okay. Let me ask you this—the router, does it have a light that looks like it's supposed to be on? Like a WiFi light or Internet light?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's a light on the front... but it's actually red right now.

Agent: Red? Okay, that means it's not establishing an internet connection from the modem. Let me have you check the connection between the modem and the router. Can you see the cable going from the modem to the router?

Customer: Yeah, I can see it. Looks like it's pretty far back there. Let me see... (pause, background noise) Okay, I'm looking at it. It seems plugged in.

Agent: Try unplugging it on both ends and plugging it back in firmly. Sometimes these connections can get a little loose.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm doing that now. First end... (pause) ...second end. (pause) Alright, plugged back in.

Agent: Good. Give the modem about 30 seconds and see if that internet light changes color.

Customer: (long pause) Still red.

Agent: Still red, okay. Hmm. Let me check something on the account here. (typing sounds, pause) Marcus, I'm gonna be honest with you. I'm not seeing any obvious issue on our end. The modem's powered up correctly, and there's no outage in your area. But I might need to escalate this to our technical team to run some diagnostics on the line itself.

Customer: Wait, before you do that... um, could it be something with the outlet? Like, is the modem plugged into a surge protector or anything?

Agent: That's actually a really good question. Is it?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it is. It's plugged into a power strip with my computer and some other stuff.

Agent: Okay, let me have you try something. Can you unplug the modem from the surge protector and plug it directly into a wall outlet?

Customer: (background noise) Really? Okay, one second... (pause, more background noise) It's unplugged. (pause) Finding another outlet... (pause) Okay, I plugged it into the wall directly. Is that gonna make a difference?

Agent: It might. The surge protector sometimes can interfere with the modem's boot sequence. Let's give it a minute to power back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay... power light's back on. (pause) Still got that green light... the internet symbol. (long pause) Oh! Oh, wait! The router light just turned green!

Agent: Excellent! That's great news! Now try connecting to the WiFi network.

Customer: (pause) Oh my God, it's working! I'm connecting... yeah, I've got a connection. That's... wow, that's so much better.

Agent: That's fantastic, Marcus! I'm really glad we got that sorted out for you.

Customer: That's amazing. It was just the surge protector? That's crazy.

Agent: Yeah, it happens more often than you'd think. Surge protectors are great for protecting equipment, but sometimes they can cause power delivery issues with modems. You should be good to go now, but if you have any more issues, you can always just plug it directly into the wall.

Customer: Will do. Thank you so much for your help, Derek. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. I'm just happy to be back online.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, Marcus. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
