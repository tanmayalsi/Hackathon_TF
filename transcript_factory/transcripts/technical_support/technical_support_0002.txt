Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging the router and everything, and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Denver area. And you're saying the internet's completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. All my lights on the modem are just... nothing. It's not lit up or anything.

Agent: Alright, let's start with the basics. Can you do me a favor and check if the modem is plugged in? Sometimes the power cord can get loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I already did that. It's plugged in, I checked behind the modem. The cord's definitely connected.

Agent: Good, good. And the power outlet itself—do you have anything else plugged into it that you know is working? Like a lamp or something?

Customer: Let me... (sound of movement) Yeah, I've got a lamp right next to it, and it's on, so the outlet's fine.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so the outlet's getting power. Now, when you look at the modem, are there any lights on at all? Even if they're not all lit up?

Customer: Uh, no. Nothing. It's completely dark.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm, that's unusual. So you've already tried unplugging it, right? Let's try a full reset. Can you unplug the modem now and just leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds?

Customer: Yeah, doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just count to thirty for me, and then we'll plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay... thirty. Plugging it back in now.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Now let's give it about a minute to boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me—have you had any recent storms or power surges in your area?

Customer: Actually, yeah. There was a pretty bad storm last night. My power went out for like twenty minutes.

Agent: Okay, that could definitely be a factor. Storms can sometimes cause issues with the modem. Go ahead and let me know when you start seeing lights on the modem.

Customer: (pause) I'm... I'm still not seeing anything. This is weird. Usually it lights up pretty quick.

Agent: Yeah, that does sound like it might be a hardware issue. Let me just double-check—the power cord is fully inserted into both the modem and the wall outlet, right?

Customer: I'm looking at it right now, and... wait. (pause) Oh, actually, I think I see something. Is there supposed to be like a little button or something on the back?

Agent: There is, actually. There's a reset button. But we want to avoid that for now since we're trying to get it powered on first. You're saying you're seeing something now?

Customer: No, I mean like, I don't see any lights at all. I was just asking.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Um, let me try something else. Can you check if there's a second power cable? Sometimes there's one that's separate for the battery backup.

Customer: (sound of movement) Let me look... I'm checking behind everything here. (pause) I don't think so? I only see the one cable.

Agent: Alright. Have you noticed any burning smell or anything that seems off about the modem itself?

Customer: No, nothing like that.

Agent: Okay. Well, at this point, it's sounding like the modem might have been damaged by that power surge from the storm last night. The fact that there's no power indicator at all is a pretty strong sign that the device itself isn't functioning. (typing sounds) I'm going to go ahead and arrange for a replacement modem to be sent out to you. That should arrive within two to three business days.

Customer: Wait, so there's nothing else we can try? Two or three days is... I really need my internet back sooner than that.

Agent: I understand. Let me check one more thing. (pause) Can you tell me—when you first noticed it was down, did you hear any kind of noise or see any kind of activity before it completely shut off?

Customer: No, it was just... I was working, and then suddenly I lost connection. I figured it was just a temporary blip, but then when I went to check, the modem was just dark.

Agent: Gotcha. Yeah, that sounds consistent with a power surge. Unfortunately, if the modem itself has failed, there's not really a troubleshooting step that's going to bring it back online. (pause) Now, here's what I can do for you. Let me see if we can expedite this shipment. Give me one second. (typing sounds, pause)

Customer: Okay...

Agent: I've submitted a priority replacement request, so instead of three business days, it should arrive within one to two business days. And I'm also going to credit your account for one month of service since you're going to be without internet temporarily. Does that help?

Customer: I mean, I guess that's better than nothing. But you're absolutely sure there's no way to get this working? Like, is there any way a technician could come out or something?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) I can get a technician out to you, but given what we're seeing here—no power indicators at all on the modem—the diagnosis is pretty clear. The equipment itself has failed. A technician visit would be $99, and they would ultimately end up recommending the same replacement. So I wouldn't want to charge you for that when we know the modem needs to be replaced anyway.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess you're right. Okay, so just to confirm—the modem's coming in one to two business days?

Agent: That's correct. I'll send you a confirmation email with tracking information as soon as the replacement ships. You'll be able to monitor its status. And just to set expectations, once it arrives, installation is pretty straightforward. You'll just unbox it, plug it in, and it should automatically provision to your account. If you have any trouble, you can call us back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's... that's it.

Agent: Alright. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Your ticket number is 447829 if you need to reference this call. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
