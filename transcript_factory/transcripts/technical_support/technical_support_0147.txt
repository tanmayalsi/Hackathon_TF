Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so my internet just completely went out about an hour ago. I've got no connection at all and I need to get this working. I'm supposed to be working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I'm showing an account for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage as of about an hour ago, is that correct?

Customer: Right, yeah. One minute it was working fine, next thing I know the router just went dark. Like, all the lights went out on it.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Before we dig too deep, let me ask you—do you have the Frontier gateway router, or are you using your own equipment?

Customer: It's the one you guys provided. It's the white box thing. I think it's a... uh... (pause) I'm not sure of the exact model.

Agent: That's alright. No worries. Okay, so the lights on the router are all out. Let me ask you this—do you still have power to the unit? Is it plugged in?

Customer: Oh, yeah, it's definitely plugged in. I can see it's plugged into the outlet right now.

Agent: Alright, and just to confirm, you're not seeing any lights at all on the front of it? Not even a power indicator?

Customer: Nope. Nothing. It's completely dark. I even tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, but that didn't help.

Agent: Okay, I appreciate you trying that. That's actually the first thing I would've suggested. Let me check something on my end. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm looking at your line here, and I'm actually not seeing any issues on the network side currently. But let me ask—when you unplugged it, did you wait a few seconds before plugging it back in?

Customer: Um... (pause) Maybe like... five seconds? Is that not long enough?

Agent: Actually, ideally you want to let it sit for about thirty seconds. That gives everything a chance to fully reset. Why don't we try that again? Go ahead and unplug it for me, and this time just count to thirty before you plug it back in.

Customer: Alright, give me a second. (background noise of movement) Okay, unplugged. (pause) I'm counting... (pause) ...twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) (background noise)

Agent: Great. Now what I want you to do is just give it about a minute or so to boot back up. You should see some lights start to come on. Let me know once you start seeing activity.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it... (pause) still nothing. It's still completely dark.

Agent: Huh. Alright, that's unusual. Let me ask you this—you're looking at the power outlet itself, right? Do you see any indication that the outlet has power? Like, is there anything else plugged into that outlet?

Customer: Well, there's a lamp right next to it and that lamp is on, so yeah, the outlet definitely has power.

Agent: Okay, good. So the outlet is definitely live. (pause) Robert, I'm wondering if the gateway itself might have failed. But before we go down that road, let me try one more thing. Do you have a different power cable you could try? Sometimes the power adapter can go bad.

Customer: Um... I mean, I could look around and see if I have something compatible, but I'm not sure. What would it look like?

Agent: It would be a black cable, probably about this thick (gestures, realizes customer can't see), sorry—I mean it's a fairly thin cable, and it would have a cylindrical connector on the end that plugs into the bottom of the router. Do you have anything like that lying around?

Customer: (pause) I don't think so. I could check my junk drawer, but... I mean, I'm not really sure what I'm looking for. Can't you guys just send me a new one?

Agent: We can definitely explore that option. But before we do, let me just verify one more time that we've exhausted the troubleshooting steps. Are you absolutely certain the power cable is fully seated in the port? Sometimes they can wiggle loose.

Customer: Hold on, let me go check that more carefully. (background noise fades) Okay, I'm looking at the back of the router now. The cable is definitely... I mean, it looks like it's in there. (pause) Wait, let me try pushing it in a little more. (sound of something clicking) Oh! Oh, okay! I see some lights! There's some lights coming on!

Agent: Oh, excellent! Okay, great! So we're getting power now. What lights are you seeing?

Customer: Okay, so there's a... there's a power light that's green, and then there's... I see some other lights but they're... they're kind of blinking? Is that normal?

Agent: That's actually perfectly normal. Those are activity lights. The router is booting up right now. What I want you to do is just give it another minute or two to fully initialize. Once it boots completely, you should see some of those lights stabilize, and you might see an internet light or a WiFi light come on as well.

Customer: Okay, I can do that. (pause) I'm waiting... (pause) Um, it's been like a minute now and some of the lights have stopped blinking, but I'm not... I don't think my internet is working yet. Like, I tried to load a webpage on my phone and it's not loading.

Agent: Alright, let's give it just another thirty seconds or so. Sometimes it takes a couple minutes to fully sync with our network. (pause) How about now?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. The WiFi network name is showing up on my phone, but it won't actually connect to it. Or, wait—it's connected but there's no internet. Like, there's no data flowing through.

Agent: Okay, that's actually helpful information. So the router is powered on, the lights are on, and the WiFi is broadcasting, but you're not getting actual internet connectivity. Let me check on the network side again. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm. Robert, I'm not seeing any issues on our end. The line is showing as active. (pause) Let me ask you—is there an internet light or a WAN light on the router? It might be labeled as "Internet" or "WAN" or sometimes it says "Online."

Customer: (pause) Let me look... okay, I see... I see a light that says "Internet" on it. It's currently off though. It's not lit up.

Agent: That's actually the key here. That Internet light should be on. That light indicates that the router is receiving signal from us. If that's off, it means the connection isn't being established. (pause) Okay, let me ask—do you have a coaxial cable running from the wall outlet to the router? It's a thick cable with metal connectors on the ends.

Customer: Oh, yeah! I see it. It's connected to the back of the router.

Agent: Great. Can you check and make sure that cable is tight at both ends? Sometimes those can wiggle loose too.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm checking... the one on the router is pretty tight... (pause) and the one going into the wall is... (sound of slight resistance) actually, I think I can get a little bit more resistance out of this one. Let me tighten it. (sounds of struggle) There we go. Okay, now it's good and tight.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's just wait a moment and see if that Internet light comes on.

Customer: (pause) Still... no. Still off. How long should I wait?

Agent: It should light up pretty quickly, within maybe thirty seconds or so. (pause) Robert, I hate to say it, but at this point I think we might be dealing with either a modem issue or possibly a line-side issue. Let me put you on a brief hold while I run a few diagnostics on our end. It should just take me a minute or two. Is that alright?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

Agent: Great, thank you. I'll be right back with you.

(hold music, approximately one minute)

Agent: Alright, Robert, I'm back. So I've run the diagnostics and I'm not seeing any signal coming from your line at all. That tells me that either the modem is not syncing to our network, or there's an issue on the line itself. Now, here's what I want to try. I'm going to need you to reboot the router one more time, but this time do it differently. I want you to locate the reset button on the back of the router. It's a small button, usually recessed so you can't hit it accidentally.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see a small button on the back. You want me to press it?

Agent: Actually, don't press it yet. If you hold that button down for about ten seconds, it will perform a full reset. Now, this will erase any custom settings you might have, but we'll reconfigure it afterward. Are you okay with that?

Customer: Uh... I mean, I don't have any custom settings that I know of. So yeah, I can do that.

Agent: Alright, go ahead.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it down... (pause) ...ten seconds... (pause) now letting it go. (pause) Okay, the lights are all blinking again.

Agent: Good. Now let's let it fully boot up again. This might take a couple minutes. Let me know once things settle down.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been like two minutes now... (pause) Alright, things have settled and... (pause) no. The Internet light is still off. Still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Alright. I... I think at this point what we're likely looking at is either a hardware failure on the modem side or a signal issue on our line. I'd like to escalate this to our technical team. They can run some more in-depth diagnostics and potentially schedule a technician to come out and check the line if needed. But I want to make sure we have all the information first. Can you tell me—have you had any weather recently? Any storms or anything like that?

Customer: Uh, no, not that I can think of. It's been pretty clear today.

Agent: Okay. And just to be thorough, have you made any changes to your setup recently? New equipment, anything moved around?

Customer: No, no changes. Everything's been the same for months.

Agent: Alright. Well, here's where we're at. I'm not able to resolve this remotely, unfortunately. What I'm going to do is create a ticket for our technical support team, and they will reach out to you within the next twenty-four hours to schedule a technician visit. When the technician comes out, they can check the modem, check the line connections, and make sure everything is functioning properly on our end. Does that work for you?

Customer: (pause) I mean... not really. I need my internet working today. Is there any way to get someone out here faster? I'm working from home and this is kind of a big deal.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry we're having this issue. Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm checking our technician availability for today... (pause) Unfortunately, our next available appointment today is actually fully booked. However, I can flag this as a priority ticket, and there's a chance they could fit you in. They'll call you when they reach out, usually in the morning, and you can see what the soonest available time would be. There's also a chance—and I can't guarantee this—but there's a chance that if a technician becomes available later today, they might be able to swing by. It's not promised, but it's possible.

Customer: Okay, well... I guess that's better than nothing. How soon will they call me?

Agent: The team typically reaches out between 8 AM and 5 PM the next business day. Since you're calling now, it would be tomorrow morning. Do you have a preferred time window?

Customer: Earlier is better. Like, early morning if possible?

Agent: I'll make a note of that on your ticket. (typing sounds) Okay, I've added it as a priority ticket, flagged for early callback tomorrow morning. Is the phone number on your account still the best number to reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm truly sorry we weren't able to get this resolved today, Robert. I know this is inconvenient. Just to recap—you should expect a call from our technical team tomorrow morning. They'll assess the situation and get someone out to you as quickly as possible.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, Derek. I guess I'll just... work from my phone's hotspot or something until this gets fixed.

Agent: I appreciate your patience. And if you need anything else in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a good evening, Robert.

Customer: You too. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
