# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I've tried restarting the router and nothing's working. I really need to get this fixed because I have work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll see what we can do. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, got it. I'm seeing your account now. So you mentioned your internet is completely down. Are you able to see any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, let me look... yeah, the modem has some lights on it. They're like, I think green and red? I'm not really sure which is which.

Agent: Okay, no problem. So which lights are lit up? Is it just one or multiple?

Customer: There's like... I think there's a green light on the left and then some red lights. There's definitely a red one blinking.

Agent: Alright, so the red light that's blinking—that typically indicates an issue with the connection. Let's do a quick reset. Can you unplug the modem from the power source for me?

Customer: Sure, give me a second. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds. While that's happening, can you also unplug your router if you have one separate from the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I've got a separate router. (pause) Okay, both unplugged now.

Agent: Great. Let's wait about... another 10 seconds or so and then we'll plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Alright, how much longer?

Agent: Go ahead and plug in the modem now. Let's give that about a minute to boot back up, and then we'll plug the router in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged in. I can see the lights coming back on.

Agent: Good. Once those lights stabilize—and the green light should be solid, not blinking—go ahead and plug your router back in.

Customer: Yeah, I'm gonna do that now. (pause) (typing sounds in background) Okay, it's plugged in. How long should this take?

Agent: It should take about two to three minutes for everything to fully boot up. Why don't we wait just a moment and then you can try connecting to the internet and let me know what happens?

Customer: (longer pause) Okay, I'm trying now... I've got my laptop here and... um... (pause) No, it's still not connecting. It's still saying no connection available.

Agent: Hmm, okay. When you look at the router, what color are the lights now?

Customer: Well, the... the modem has like a green light that's solid now, which is good I guess, but the router... (pause) the WiFi light on the router is not on. It's definitely off.

Agent: Ah, okay. That tells me the router might not be receiving signal from the modem. Let's check the cable connection. Can you look at the back of the modem and see if there's an ethernet cable running from the modem to the router?

Customer: Oh, yeah, there's a cable... (pause) It looks... I think it might be loose? It looks like it might have come unplugged.

Agent: Can you go ahead and unplug it completely and then plug it back in? Make sure you hear a little click.

Customer: (pause) Okay, trying that now... (pause) I think I got it. Yeah, I think that clicked in.

Agent: Good. Now let's check the router again. Do you see the WiFi light coming on?

Customer: (pause) I'm looking... no, not yet. Still nothing.

Agent: It might take a minute or two. While we wait, let me ask—have you noticed any outages in your area? Any storms or anything like that recently?

Customer: No, no storms. It was working fine yesterday. I woke up this morning and it was just... gone. No warning or anything.

Agent: Understood. (pause) Any luck with that WiFi light yet?

Customer: (pause) No, nothing. This is... this is really not good. I have a meeting at like 10 o'clock.

Agent: I understand. Let me try a few more things here. Can you restart the modem one more time? I want to see if we can get that router to sync up.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) So do I unplug it again?

Agent: Yes, go ahead. Let's do the same thing—unplug it, wait 30 seconds, and plug it back in.

Customer: Okay. (pause) It's unplugged. (longer pause) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) And I'm gonna plug the router back in too.

Agent: Good. Let's give this a full boot cycle. While we're waiting, can you tell me—have you had any recent storms or service interruptions in your building or neighborhood?

Customer: Not that I know of. I mean, like I said, it was fine yesterday. I don't know what changed.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm actually looking at our systems here and... I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, so that's not it. (pause) How are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Um, the modem is still showing green, but the router WiFi light... still nothing. I don't understand what's wrong.

Agent: I know this is frustrating. (pause) Let me try a different approach. Can you try a wired connection? If you have an ethernet cable, can you connect your computer directly to the modem instead of using WiFi?

Customer: A wired connection? Um... I might have a cable somewhere. Let me look... (longer pause) Okay, I found one. I'm gonna plug it in. (pause) Alright, it's connected directly to the modem now.

Agent: Perfect. Now try to see if you can access anything online with that wired connection.

Customer: (pause) No, it's still not working. Same thing—no internet access. (frustrated sigh)

Agent: Okay, I'm seeing that even the wired connection isn't working, which tells me the issue is with the modem itself and not the router. Let me check our system notes here... (typing sounds) (pause) 

I'm going to be honest with you—I'm not seeing any network signal coming into your modem at all. That usually indicates either a line issue or possibly a problem with the modem hardware itself.

Customer: What does that mean? How long is this gonna take to fix?

Agent: Well, we have a couple of options. I can schedule a technician to come out and check the physical line to your location. They can also bring a replacement modem if it turns out the hardware is the problem.

Customer: How long for a technician? I really need the internet working today.

Agent: Let me check availability... (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest I can get someone out there is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. I apologize, but we don't have same-day availability at the moment.

Customer: Tomorrow? Come on, that doesn't help me at all. Is there anything else you can do right now?

Agent: I wish I could, but based on the troubleshooting we've done, this is beyond what I can resolve from here. It's definitely a line-level issue or a hardware failure, and that requires an in-person visit.

Customer: (pause) Alright, yeah, I guess I don't have much choice. Can I get that scheduled?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that set up for you. So that's for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM. I'm going to text you a confirmation and give you a confirmation number. Is the phone number we're calling from the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. Your confirmation number is 447-928. A technician will be out to you tomorrow morning. They'll check the line and assess the modem. In the meantime, if you need to make that meeting, you might want to find an alternative location with WiFi—a coffee shop or something like that.

Customer: Yeah, I'll figure something out. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it. I'll just see the technician tomorrow.

Agent: Alright, we'll get this sorted out. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: Yeah, bye.

Agent: Take care.
