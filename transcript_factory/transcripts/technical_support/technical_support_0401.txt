Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went down completely. Like, it's been out for maybe twenty minutes now and I've tried unplugging the modem but nothing's working.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking that up now. And just to confirm, you're the primary account holder?

Customer: Yeah, that's me. Look, I really need this fixed. I'm working from home today and I have a meeting in like... (pause) ...an hour and a half.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what I can do here. Okay, so I'm seeing your account and it looks like your service is currently active on our end. That's good news. Now, when you unplugged the modem, how long did you wait before plugging it back in?

Customer: Um, maybe thirty seconds? Should I have waited longer?

Agent: Yeah, actually, for future reference, you want to wait at least two to three minutes. That allows the modem to fully power down and reset. But let's try that again right now. Can you unplug your modem for me?

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we wait, do you see any lights on the modem right now?

Customer: No, nothing. It's completely dark.

Agent: Perfect. That's what we want to see. Now let's wait about three minutes. I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: Okay... (long pause) This is so frustrating. I just got this fiber service like three months ago and it's been pretty solid until now.

Agent: I hear you. Fiber is generally very reliable, so this is definitely unusual. (pause) Go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: Okay, plugging it in now. (pause) Alright, lights are coming back on. There's a white light, and now it's... wait, the white one's blinking. Is that normal?

Agent: The white light blinking usually means it's initializing. That should stabilize in about a minute or two. Do you have any other colored lights?

Customer: Um, yeah, there's a green light that came on, but it's blinking too.

Agent: Okay, the green light is your internet connection. Once that stops blinking and stays solid, you should have connectivity. Let's give it another minute.

Customer: (pause) ...Still blinking. Both of them.

Agent: Hmm, okay. How long has it been blinking now?

Customer: I don't know, maybe two minutes?

Agent: Yeah, they should really have stabilized by now. Let me try a different approach. Can you tell me—do you have a router, or are you connecting directly to the modem?

Customer: I have a router. A Frontier one that you guys provided.

Agent: Okay, good. Is the router powered on?

Customer: Yes, it's right here. It's got lights on it too. Let me see... there's a couple of lights on it, but I'm not really sure what they mean.

Agent: No problem. Can you look at the back of the modem and tell me if there's an Ethernet cable plugged into the port labeled "Internet" or sometimes it's marked with a different color?

Customer: (pause) Uh... (pause) Yeah, I see a cable in there. It's yellow. Well, it looks yellow.

Agent: Okay, that might actually be the issue. Can you unplug that cable for me and plug it back in? Make sure it clicks in all the way.

Customer: Alright, unplugging it... (pause) ...okay, plugging it back in. Did that click? I think it clicked.

Agent: Great. Now let's see if that helps. How's the green light looking now?

Customer: (pause) It's... it's still blinking. I don't think anything changed.

Agent: Alright, let me check a few other things. Are you able to look outside? Do you see a Frontier box on your property or near your home?

Customer: Oh, um... yeah, actually, I think I see something. There's like a gray box on the side of my house near the garage. That's it, right?

Agent: Yes, that should be it. Can you walk over there and see if there are any lights on it? There should be a few status indicators.

Customer: (background noise of walking) Okay, I'm here. (pause) There's a light, but it's red. Is that bad?

Agent: Hmm, a red light isn't ideal. That typically indicates an issue with the line. (pause) Can you tell me if it's a solid red or blinking red?

Customer: It's solid. Just... solid red.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Unfortunately, that usually means there's an issue between our network and your home connection. Let me reach out to my technical team and see if we're experiencing any outages in your area.

Customer: How long is that gonna take?

Agent: (typing sounds) Just give me one second... (pause) Okay, I'm checking our system now. I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported in your zip code. Let me... (pause) ...actually, let me try something else first. There should be a small reset button on that gray box. Do you see it?

Customer: Um, I'm looking... yeah, I think so? There's like a tiny button here.

Agent: Okay, can you press and hold it for about ten seconds?

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...holding it. (pause) ...still holding. (pause) Okay, that's ten seconds. (background noise) Now what?

Agent: Now let's go back inside and check the modem. The lights should start cycling again.

Customer: (background noise of walking) Alright, I'm back at the modem. (pause) The white light is blinking again, and the green one is... (pause) ...it's still blinking too.

Agent: Okay, they should settle down here in a minute. Let me ask you—have you made any recent changes to your setup? Like, did you move the modem or unplug anything else recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Everything's been the same. I don't know what happened.

Agent: (pause) Alright, and the green light—is it blinking faster or slower than before?

Customer: I mean... it kind of looks the same to me?

Agent: I understand. Unfortunately, based on what we're seeing—the solid red light on the outdoor unit and the modem not fully initializing—this sounds like it could be a physical line issue. That's something we'd need to send a technician out to diagnose.

Customer: Are you serious? How long would that take?

Agent: (pause) Let me check availability for you. Can you tell me what days this week work best for you?

Customer: I mean, I'm working from home today, so ideally... soon? Like, could someone come today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see... (pause) ...unfortunately, our next available appointment in your area is... tomorrow between 12 PM and 4 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow? But I need to work today. My internet is completely down.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Unfortunately, that's the soonest availability I have. However, you know what, let me try one more thing before we schedule that. Can you power down the router as well and wait a few minutes? Just to be thorough.

Customer: Okay, fine. (pause) It's off. How long do I wait?

Agent: Let's do five minutes this time.

Customer: (long pause) This is ridiculous. I pay like sixty bucks a month for this.

Agent: I hear you. (pause) Okay, go ahead and power the router back on, and then the modem if it's not already on.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, they're both on. I'm turning on the router now.

Agent: (pause) How's it looking?

Customer: (pause) Same thing. The lights are blinking. The green one is... (pause) ...still blinking. Nothing changed.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Unfortunately, I think at this point we do need to get a technician out there. There's likely a line issue on our end that I can't diagnose remotely. The good news is our technician will be able to identify and fix it once they're there.

Customer: So that's it? You can't fix it?

Agent: I'm sorry I wasn't able to resolve this for you today. The symptoms we're seeing do indicate a physical line problem that needs hands-on assessment. But I promise you, the technician will take care of it. Shall I schedule you for tomorrow between 12 and 4?

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, I guess. Do I have to be here?

Agent: Yes, someone will need to be home to let the technician access the outdoor unit. We'll also call you about thirty minutes before arrival to confirm the appointment.

Customer: Great. Fine. Tomorrow, 12 to 4.

Agent: Perfect. I have that scheduled for you. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: I apologize again that we couldn't get this resolved today. We really appreciate your patience, and we'll get this fixed for you tomorrow. Thank you for choosing Frontier.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
