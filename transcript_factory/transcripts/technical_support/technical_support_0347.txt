Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been trying to figure it out, but nothing's working. I need to get this fixed pretty soon.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you taken care of. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm showing you're in the Riverside area on our fiber service. So your internet just went down this morning, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 9 AM. I was working from home and just... everything stopped. I tried unplugging the router and the modem, waiting like five minutes, and plugging them back in, but still nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's a good first step that you already tried. Let me walk through a few things with you. When you say nothing's working—do you see any lights on the modem or the router at all right now?

Customer: Um... let me look. (pause) Okay, so the modem—the lights are kind of flickering. Like, they're not solid. It's like red and then... I'm not sure, it's kind of hard to see back there.

Agent: Alright, red flickering usually indicates that there's no connection signal coming into the modem. That could be a few things. Let me check if there are any outages in your area right now. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any active outages reported, so that's good news.

Customer: Okay, so... what does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. Sometimes it's just a line issue or a problem with the equipment. Let's try a few more steps. Can you locate the battery backup on your modem? It looks like a small box, usually sitting near the modem itself.

Customer: Battery backup? I... I'm not sure I have one of those. Is it necessary?

Agent: It's not necessary for the internet to work, no. What I'm trying to do is just double-check your setup. Okay, so you have the modem and the router. Are they connected with an ethernet cable?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. There's a cable going from the modem to the router.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm—where is your modem located? Is it near a window or anything like that?

Customer: It's... it's in my office. It's kind of in the corner, actually. There's a window right above it, but it's closed.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. So let me have you try something. Can you unplug the modem for me, but this time, let's wait a full minute. I know you did this before, but let's try it again and count to sixty.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. I'm gonna wait... (long pause, background noise) ...okay, it's been about a minute. Plugging it back in.

Agent: Good. Now let's give it about 30 seconds to boot back up and then check those lights again. (pause) How are the lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Same thing. Red flickering. It's not really... it's not changing.

Agent: Alright, okay. Um, let me try one more thing. Can you check if there are any cables running into your modem? Specifically, there should be a cable coming from your wall into the modem.

Customer: Yeah, there's definitely a cable. It's coming from the wall outlet. It looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay, can you unplug that cable from the wall for me?

Customer: The cable itself?

Agent: Yes, the cable that's plugged into the wall outlet. Unplug it from the wall side.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...done.

Agent: And now plug it back in, nice and firm.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's back in. (pause) Okay, same thing. Still red.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm gonna be honest with you—the fact that we're not seeing any lights stabilize is indicating that the modem might not be receiving a signal at all from our network. This could be a problem on our end with your line, or it could potentially be a modem issue.

Customer: So what does that mean? What do I do?

Agent: So here's what I'd like to do. I'm going to dispatch a technician to come out and take a look at your line. They'll be able to check the connection coming into your house and test the modem and router on-site.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) We have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could also do Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM.

Customer: I really need this fixed today if possible. Can't someone come out today?

Agent: I understand, and I really wish I could get someone out there sooner. Unfortunately, our technicians are fully booked for today, but I can put you at the top of the list for first thing tomorrow morning if that helps.

Customer: (sigh) I mean, I guess that's... I guess I don't have much choice, do I?

Agent: I understand your frustration. I really do. The good news is, once we get a technician out there, they'll be able to identify exactly what's wrong and get you back online. Can I get a number to reach you at?

Customer: It's the same number—555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. And just to recap—I'm scheduling you for tomorrow, Tuesday, between 8 AM and 12 PM. You'll get a confirmation call about an hour before the technician arrives. Is there anything else I can help you with tonight?

Customer: No, I guess that's... that's it. I just really hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident they will. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, and thanks for your patience while we worked through this. Your appointment is all set. Have a good night.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
