Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls coming up and I can't... I can't be without internet right now.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you right here. Okay, so your internet service is showing as active on our end, which is interesting. Can you walk me through what you're experiencing right now?

Customer: Well, like I said, it just went out this morning. I tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in, and that didn't help. The modem—I think it's blinking red, or maybe orange? I'm not really sure what color it is exactly, but it's definitely not the normal blue.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So the light is red or orange instead of blue. Let me ask you a few things. When you look at the modem itself, do you see any lights that are solid or are they all blinking?

Customer: Um... (pause) they're mostly blinking. Like, I see a couple lights blinking and then there's that one that's like more of a steady glow, but it's still that weird color.

Agent: Alright, got it. And just to confirm, are both your modem and router plugged in and powered on?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, they're both on. I mean, they're plugged in and everything. The lights are on, they're just the wrong color. I don't know why that would be happening.

Agent: Okay, no problem. This is actually pretty common. That color usually indicates either a connection issue or a service issue in your area. Let me run a quick diagnostic on your modem. This should just take a moment. (typing sounds) 

(pause)

Actually, I'm not seeing any major issues from my end, but let me have you try something. Can you unplug the modem completely—that's the device that connects directly to your wall—and wait about 30 seconds before plugging it back in? Sometimes that helps reset the connection.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I can do that. (sounds of movement) Unplugging it now... and I'm waiting... (pause) Alright, it's back in. Now what?

Agent: Great. Give it about 60 seconds to boot back up. While we're waiting, let me ask—do you remember if anything changed recently? Like, did you add any new equipment, or did anything happen before the internet went out?

Customer: No, nothing. It was working fine yesterday. I was literally on the internet last night, and then this morning I just... I turned on my computer and nothing. Just dead.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so it went out sometime overnight. And now, looking at the modem again, what color is the light?

Customer: It's still... it's still doing the same thing. Like, a little bit less blinking maybe, but that orange or red light is still there. It's not turning blue or green or whatever it's supposed to be.

Agent: Alright. Let me try a different approach. Can you do a hard reset on the modem? There should be a small reset button—it might be recessed—on the back or bottom of the modem. You might need a paperclip or pen to press it.

Customer: Oh, um... let me look. (sounds of shuffling) I'm looking at the back here... I see a bunch of ports, but... oh, I think I see a little hole? Is that it?

Agent: Yes, that's probably it. Go ahead and hold that with a pen or paperclip for about ten seconds. Keep it pressed in.

Customer: Okay, holding it... ten seconds... (pause) ...and releasing. Is that good?

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait another minute for it to fully restart.

(pause)

Customer: Yeah, so... is this supposed to take a while?

Agent: It can, yeah. Sometimes the first boot after a reset takes a bit longer. Let's give it another 30 seconds or so.

(pause)

Customer: Okay. Um... no, it's still the same color. This is... I mean, is something wrong with my modem? Do I need a new one?

Agent: Not necessarily. Let me check something. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a line test from our end to see if there's an issue with the signal coming from outside. (pause) Hmm, okay. I'm actually seeing something here. It looks like your signal might be dropping in and out. 

Let me ask you this—do you live in a house or an apartment?

Customer: A house. Single-family home.

Agent: Okay, and do you know where your service line comes into your house? Like, is it coming through the wall near your modem, or is it somewhere else?

Customer: I'm not... I'm not really sure. I think it might be in the basement? I'm not super familiar with all that stuff to be honest.

Agent: No worries, a lot of people aren't. What I'd like you to do is go check if there are any loose cables near where the internet comes in. Specifically, look for a cable that screws into the modem and see if it's disconnected or loose.

Customer: (sounds of footsteps) I'm going down to the basement now. Um... okay, I'm looking around... I see some cables, but... okay, I found it. I think this is it. It's connected, but... hold on, let me check if it's tight.

Agent: Good. Try tightening it just to make sure it's secure.

Customer: Yeah, I'm turning it... okay, I think it's a little tighter now. Should I go back upstairs?

Agent: Yeah, head back up and check the modem lights.

(pause)

Customer: Okay, so... the same thing is still happening. Maybe a tiny bit different but... the color's still not right.

Agent: Alright. Unfortunately, this is pointing to either an issue with the line coming to your house or a problem with the modem itself that I'm not able to resolve over the phone. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to you. 

They'll be able to check the line outside, test the modem with their equipment, and see what's actually going on. How does that sound?

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, I mean... I don't have a choice, right? How soon can they come out? Like, can they come today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. Unfortunately, today's pretty booked, but I can get you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Tomorrow? Seriously? I need this fixed today if possible. I have important calls for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see if there's any possibility for an emergency appointment today. (pause) Unfortunately, all our technicians are booked. The earliest I can get someone is tomorrow morning. I do apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: (frustrated) This is... okay. Fine. Tomorrow morning. Can I at least get something sooner? Like, can they come in the afternoon maybe?

Agent: I can definitely put you down for tomorrow between 8 and 12, and if the tech finishes early with other appointments, they may be able to swing by earlier. Or I can also put you on a callback list in case something opens up later today, and I'll reach out to you if that happens.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Put me on the callback list. And yeah, schedule me for tomorrow morning too, I guess.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get you all set up here. Your appointment is confirmed for tomorrow, January 15th, between 8 AM and noon. And I've added you to our priority callback list. If a tech becomes available this afternoon, we'll give you a call at this number. Is 555-0847 still the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. This is just... frustrating, you know?

Agent: I totally get it, and I'm really sorry we couldn't resolve this remotely. The technician tomorrow will definitely get to the bottom of it for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... I need this working by tomorrow.

Agent: We'll make sure it happens. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and I apologize again for the inconvenience.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.
