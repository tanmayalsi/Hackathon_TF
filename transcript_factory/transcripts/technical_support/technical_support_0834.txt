# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm having an issue with my internet. It just completely went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me just pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing an account here for a David Chen at 2341 Maple Drive. Is that you?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, you're currently without internet service?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. My wife was streaming something and it just cut out. Now nothing is working.

Agent: Okay, I understand how frustrating that must be. Let's start with the basics. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Do you have any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, so the modem is in the other room. Let me go look at it.

Agent: Sure, take your time.

Customer: (background noise, footsteps) Okay, I'm looking at it now. So the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light... that one's red. Or actually, I think it's off? No, it's red.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on but the internet indicator is red. That tells me the modem isn't connecting to our network. Have you tried unplugging it yet?

Customer: No, not yet.

Agent: Why don't we go ahead and try that? Go ahead and unplug the modem from the power outlet.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Alright, unplugged.

Agent: Good. While that's unplugging, do you happen to know when you last restarted it? Or has it been running continuously?

Customer: Uh, I don't know... probably a few weeks? Maybe longer. We just kind of leave it on all the time.

Agent: That's pretty common, actually. Okay, now go ahead and plug it back in and we'll let it boot back up. This usually takes a minute or so.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Done. Now what?

Agent: Now we just wait for it to fully restart. While we're waiting, have you noticed any other issues with your service recently? Any outages, slow speeds, anything like that?

Customer: No, no. It's been working great actually. Which is why this is so weird that it just died on us.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm not showing any service outages in your area, so that's good news. Okay, what does the internet light look like now?

Customer: Still red. Is that... is that bad?

Agent: Well, it should ideally be solid green or blue, so let's keep troubleshooting. Can you check the router as well? Is the router plugged in?

Customer: The router... yeah, it's by the TV. (pause, footsteps) Okay, I see it. Um, yeah, it's got the power light on, but I don't see a separate internet light. There's just a couple other lights blinking.

Agent: Okay, that's normal for routers. Those blinking lights usually indicate activity. Let me ask you this—do you have a coaxial cable running from the modem to the wall? It should look like... like a thick cable with kind of a screw-on connector?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see that. It's connected to the modem on one end and... (background noise) ...the wall on the other.

Agent: Perfect. And it looks secure?

Customer: Looks like it to me, yeah.

Agent: Alright. Let's try restarting the router as well. Unplug the router from power for about 30 seconds and then plug it back in.

Customer: Okay. (pause, background noise) Unplugged. I'll wait a few seconds... (long pause) Alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Good. While that's coming back up, let me just ask—have you experienced any weather issues recently? Any storms or anything that could have affected the line?

Customer: No, no, the weather's been fine. It's actually been pretty nice out.

Agent: Okay. (pause) So now that the router is back up, have any of your lights changed? What's the status on the modem now?

Customer: (pause) Still red. Same as before.

Agent: Hmm, okay. (typing sounds) Let me try a couple other things here. Let me check if there are any service alerts or issues with your account. (pause) I'm not seeing anything on my end. Let me ask you—are you able to check the back of the modem? There should be a small button labeled "Reset" or sometimes it's just a pinhole.

Customer: Reset button? No, I don't... I'm looking at the back. There's a lot of ports and cables, but I don't see anything that says reset.

Agent: It might be a small hole that requires a paperclip or something similar to push.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Hmm, I don't see anything like that. There's like... a recessed thing here with an arrow pointing to it, but no label.

Agent: That might be it, actually. That could be your reset. Can you try pressing that with something thin, like a pen or paperclip? Press and hold it for about 10 seconds.

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause, background noise) ...holding it... (pause) Okay, I'm letting go.

Agent: Alright. Let's wait another minute for the modem to fully reset and boot back up.

Customer: (long pause) Okay.

Agent: (pause) How's it looking now?

Customer: Same thing. Still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay... um... Let me try something different. Can you tell me the model number of your modem? It should be on a label somewhere on the device itself.

Customer: Model number... (pause, background noise) It says, uh, "Arris SB8200."

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I see that model. That's a good modem. (pause) David, I'm going to be honest with you—the fact that the light isn't coming back to green after all of these steps suggests there might be a connectivity issue on our end, or there could be a problem with the modem itself. I want to make sure we've covered everything first though. Let me ask—do you have a second coaxial cable available? One that you could swap out?

Customer: Uh... I don't think so. Not readily available anyway.

Agent: Okay, no problem. And just to be thorough, the coaxial cable that's connected—you didn't notice any physical damage to it, right? Any tears or kinks?

Customer: No, looks fine from what I can see.

Agent: Alright. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I want to escalate this to our technical support team. They have more advanced tools to check what's happening on the line side. But before we do that, let me just try one more thing. Can you unplug both the modem and router one more time and leave them unplugged for a full two minutes? Sometimes that helps reset the connection to our network.

Customer: Two minutes? Okay. (pause, background noise) They're both unplugged now. I'm just... setting a timer on my phone.

Agent: (pause) Perfect. I'll wait on the line with you.

Customer: (long pause) So, uh, how long have you worked there?

Agent: Oh, at Frontier? About three years now. (pause) How about you—how long have you had service with us?

Customer: Uh, I'd say about two years? Maybe a little longer. We came from like, cable internet before that.

Agent: Okay, that's good. So the fiber has been treating you well up until now?

Customer: Yeah, actually, the speed's been great. That's why this is so frustrating.

Agent: I totally understand. (pause) Alright, it's been about two minutes. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Done.

Agent: Let's give it about 45 seconds to come back up.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, waiting.

Agent: Now go ahead and plug the router back in as well.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Alright, it's in.

Agent: (pause) What are we seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Um... modem internet light is... still red.

Agent: (long pause, typing sounds) I'm not hearing good news here, David. I think at this point we need to get our technical team involved. This could be an issue with the line itself or potentially a defective modem. What I'm going to do is escalate this to our Level 2 technical support team, and they can send out a technician if needed.

Customer: Okay... how long is that going to take? Like, is this going to take a few days?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm looking at next availability and I can get someone out there tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... yeah, I guess that works, but that's not ideal. My kids need internet for school stuff and...

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, given that we've exhausted the basic troubleshooting steps, we really need a technician to come out and check the line. They'll be able to run diagnostics and potentially swap out the modem if that's the issue.

Customer: Alright, fine. Tomorrow afternoon then.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. The tech should be out there sometime between 12 and 4 PM. You should receive a confirmation call about an hour before they arrive. And David, just to make sure—someone will be home to let them in?

Customer: Yeah, I'll make sure of it.

Agent: Excellent. I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today, but our technician will definitely get you back up and running. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's it. Just get it fixed tomorrow, okay?

Agent: We will. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the trouble. Have a good day, David.

Customer: Yeah, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
