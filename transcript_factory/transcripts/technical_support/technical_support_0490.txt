# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of. I'm pretty frustrated at this point.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And your name?

Customer: It's Jim. Jim Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, Jim. I've got your account here. So you're saying your internet is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely. Nothing. I tried unplugging the router, waited like five minutes, plugged it back in. The lights on the modem aren't even coming on anymore, which is weird because they were blinking before.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. No lights on the modem at all—that usually points to a power issue. Let's check a couple things. Can you go ahead and verify that the power cable is firmly connected to the modem? Sometimes these can come loose without us realizing it.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. It seems pretty tight, but... let me try wiggling it a little bit. (pause) Okay, still nothing. No lights.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm—you're looking at the modem we provided to you, right? Not your router?

Customer: Yeah, the modem. It's the white box with the Frontier logo on it.

Agent: Great. Um, I'd like you to try something for me. Can you unplug the modem completely from the power outlet, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in? And this time, just let it sit for about a minute or two. Sometimes it needs a fresh boot cycle.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged. (pause) Alright, plugging it back in... (pause) Waiting... (pause) Still nothing. The lights are still not coming on.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, I'm not seeing any service alerts in your area, so it's not a widespread outage. Did anything happen before the internet went out? Like a power surge or storm in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine this morning, and then I came home from work and it was just... dead.

Agent: I understand. Let me just check something on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any issues on our network side for your location. The modem should be receiving a signal. Jim, do you have another power outlet you could try? Preferably one that you know is working?

Customer: Yeah, I can try that. Hold on. (background noise of footsteps) Okay, I unplugged it and I'm moving it over here. (pause) Plugging it in to this outlet... (pause) Still nothing.

Agent: Alright. I'm going to be honest with you—if it's not powering on from multiple outlets, that suggests the modem itself may have failed. But before we go down that road, I want to rule out one more thing. Can you check the power cable itself? Is there any visible damage? Any fraying or burns or anything like that?

Customer: (pause) No, it looks fine to me. Pretty normal.

Agent: Okay, and this is the original cable that came with your setup, or have you replaced it?

Customer: It's the original, I think. I haven't touched any of this stuff since you guys installed it three months ago.

Agent: (pause) Understood. Jim, I'm going to be straightforward with you—based on everything we've tried, it really does seem like the modem has experienced a hardware failure. Unfortunately, that's not something we can fix over the phone. However, what I can do is get a replacement modem sent out to you.

Customer: How long is that going to take? I need internet for work. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so if I process this right now, I can get an expedited shipment sent out to you. It would arrive by tomorrow afternoon. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... I mean, it's better than nothing, but... can't you just send a technician out today? Or like, isn't there anything else we can try?

Agent: I wish I could send someone today, but our technicians are actually booked out for the rest of the day. And honestly, Jim, given that we've exhausted the troubleshooting steps and the modem isn't showing any power at all, a technician visit probably wouldn't be able to do anything in this situation either. The modem would need to be replaced.

Customer: (frustrated) This is just... I really needed this to work today. I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

Agent: I hear you, and I'm really sorry. Um, let me see if there's anything else I can do. (pause, typing sounds) Actually, you know what? Since this appears to be a hardware issue and you've been with us for three months without any prior issues, I can waive the shipping fee and I'm also going to add a service credit to your account for the downtime. That's about the best I can do in this situation.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I guess that's something. So I'm definitely not getting internet back today, though?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. Not unless we can identify another issue. Do you happen to have access to a mobile hotspot or anything like that for tonight?

Customer: I mean, I can use my phone's hotspot, but it's going to be slow for what I need. This is just really bad timing.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'm truly sorry we couldn't get this resolved for you today. Let me get that expedited modem ordered for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got your address here on file. I'm just confirming—that's 447 Maple Drive, apartment 3B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And your contact number is the one on the account?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Excellent. So the modem will arrive tomorrow between 12 and 5 PM. Once you receive it, you'll just need to connect it the same way the old one was set up. The instructions will be in the box. If you run into any issues with that, just give us a call back and we'll walk you through it. 

Customer: Okay. And you said you're putting a credit on my account?

Agent: Yes, I've added a fifteen-dollar credit for the service interruption. That'll show up on your next billing cycle. Jim, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (pause) No, I guess that's it. Thanks for trying, anyway.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved faster. We appreciate your business, and we'll get you back online tomorrow. Have a good evening.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
