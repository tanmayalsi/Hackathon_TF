Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it working because I've got stuff I need to do for work.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. The service address is 2842 Maple Street.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up right now. One moment... Got it. So Marcus Chen at that address. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Alright, Marcus. So your internet service is currently down. Let me ask you a few quick questions. First, can you see if your modem and router are powered on? They should have lights on them.

Customer: Oh, um, yeah. Let me look... (pause) Okay, so the modem has like... it's got a power light that's on, but I don't see any of the other lights. Like, the internet light isn't lit up at all.

Agent: That's actually really helpful information. What color is the power light?

Customer: It's green.

Agent: Okay, and is the modem making any beeping sounds or anything unusual?

Customer: No, it's just... silent. But like I said, no internet light.

Agent: Right. And how about your router? Can you check that one too?

Customer: (pause) The router's... yeah, it also has the power light on, but nothing else is lit up either. That's weird, right?

Agent: It could be a few things. Let's try a restart. Can you unplug the modem first? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay, done.

Agent: Great. And while we're waiting, go ahead and unplug the router too.

Customer: (pause) Alright, both unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about 30 seconds just to let everything reset. (pause) You still there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Okay, so it's been about 30 seconds. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in now... (pause) Okay, it's plugged in.

Agent: Good. Now we're gonna wait for it to fully boot up. That usually takes a minute or two. You should start seeing some lights come on.

Customer: (pause) Um, I'm... I'm not seeing anything really. Just the power light like before.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. How long has it been since you plugged it in?

Customer: I don't know, maybe like a minute?

Agent: Alright, let's give it another 30 seconds or so. Sometimes it takes a bit longer. (pause) Do you happen to know if there were any storms last night? Sometimes that can affect the connection.

Customer: Actually, now that you mention it, yeah, there was pretty bad weather around 2 AM. I remember waking up to lightning and stuff.

Agent: That could very well be the issue. Power surges from storms can definitely affect equipment. Okay, and now—has anything changed with the modem? Are you seeing any new lights?

Customer: (pause) No. Still just the power light. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for that. Let's go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: Okay... (pause) It's back in.

Agent: Good. Now, while that's booting up, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your connection status here, and it's showing that we're not detecting any active connection from your equipment. That suggests the issue might be either with the modem or possibly on our network side. Let me run a quick test on the line. (pause) Okay, the line itself seems to be active, so it's not an outage in your area.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it most likely means there's an issue with your modem. The storm surge probably damaged it. Have you noticed the modem feeling warm at all, or do you smell anything unusual coming from it?

Customer: (pause) Now that you mention it, there's like a slight... I don't know, kind of a burnt smell? Is that bad?

Agent: Yeah, that does sound like the modem may have been damaged by the power surge. That's what I suspected. We have a couple of options here. First, let me have you try one more thing—do you have a different power outlet you could plug the modem into? Maybe one on a different wall?

Customer: Uh, sure. Let me unplug it and try the one by the TV. (pause) Okay, plugged in over here.

Agent: Alright, and is the smell still there?

Customer: Yeah, it's still there.

Agent: (pause) Okay, unfortunately that pretty much confirms that the modem has been damaged. That's not something we can fix over the phone. We're gonna need to get you a replacement unit.

Customer: Okay, so what do I need to do? How long is that gonna take?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) I can arrange for a technician to come out and swap out the equipment for you. Looking at our calendar, the earliest we have availability is... it looks like Thursday between 1 PM and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Thursday? That's three days from now. I need my internet before then. Isn't there anything sooner?

Agent: I understand the urgency, Marcus. Unfortunately, we don't have any openings until Thursday in your area. We do have an expedited option where you could pay an extra $39.99 fee to potentially get a technician out tomorrow, but I can't guarantee that slot.

Customer: (pause) I... I mean, I really need this working. Can you just check one more time if there's anything we can do right now?

Agent: Of course. Let me try... (pause) Can you listen to the modem one more time? Just put your ear close to it and tell me if you hear any sounds at all.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm listening... I hear a very faint humming sound, but that's about it.

Agent: Right, that's just the power supply. Unfortunately, that confirms the main board isn't functioning properly. I wish I had better news, but I really don't think there's anything else we can troubleshoot here. The equipment needs to be physically replaced.

Customer: So Thursday is really my only option?

Agent: Well, you have the expedited option for tomorrow. That would be an additional charge, but it could potentially get you connected by tomorrow afternoon or evening.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, you know what, I think I need to do that. I can't be without internet for three days.

Agent: I appreciate that. Let me get you set up for the expedited service. (typing sounds) Okay, so that's $39.99 on top of your regular service call. The technician will bring a replacement modem, and we'll get you back up and running. Is the address still 2842 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: And what's a good contact number for the technician to reach you tomorrow?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Perfect. So to confirm, we have you scheduled for expedited service tomorrow between 1 PM and 4 PM. A technician will arrive with replacement equipment and get everything up and running for you.

Customer: Okay. And I should expect the $39.99 charge on my next bill?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. It will show up on your next statement. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, Marcus. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today, but hopefully tomorrow will get you all set. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day. Bye now.
