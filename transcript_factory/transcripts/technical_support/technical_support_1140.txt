# Frontier Communications - Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it back up and running.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And what name is the account under?

Customer: It's under James Peterson.

Agent: (pause) Okay, James, I'm pulling up your account now. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have you tried power cycling your modem yet?

Customer: Power cycling? Um... I unplugged it for like, thirty seconds this morning, but nothing happened.

Agent: Okay, that's a good start. Let's try that again, but this time let's leave it unplugged for about two minutes. That'll give it a full reset. While you're doing that, I'm going to check your service status on this end.

Customer: Alright, hold on. (sounds of movement, rustling) Okay, it's unplugged now.

Agent: (typing sounds) So while we wait, I'm seeing that there were some service alerts in your area this morning. But it looks like those were resolved around 9 AM. What time exactly did you notice your internet went down?

Customer: Uh, I'd say around 8:30 when I was trying to work from home. I figured it was just the outage everyone was talking about, but then it never came back.

Agent: Got it. Okay, go ahead and plug that modem back in now. (pause) It should take about a minute to fully boot up. While that's happening, can you tell me if you see any lights on the front of the modem? Any activity?

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I can see the power light is on now, and... okay, the internet light is starting to blink. Is that normal?

Agent: The blinking is normal while it's connecting. That should turn solid in a moment. Let me also ask—are you directly connected to the modem with an ethernet cable, or are you on WiFi?

Customer: WiFi. I'm in my home office upstairs.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. Just give it another thirty seconds. (pause) Anything happening now?

Customer: (pause) Um... the internet light is still blinking. It's been like, a minute now.

Agent: Alright, let's give it another minute. Sometimes it takes a little longer to reconnect to the network after an outage. While we wait, I'm going to check if there's anything on my end that might be blocking your service. (typing sounds) Have there been any recent changes to your equipment? Did anything get unplugged or moved?

Customer: No, everything's been in the same spot. I haven't touched anything except to unplug it.

Agent: Understood. (pause) Okay, James, I'm not seeing any blocks or service interruptions on the account itself. The modem should be online by now. Can you do me a favor and try opening a web browser and going to any website?

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) ...No, it's still not connecting. Says "no internet connection." This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand. Let me try a few more things here. Can you tell me—are there any lights on the modem that are red or amber? Or any that look unusual?

Customer: Let me look at it. (pause) There's the power light which is white, the internet light is... still blinking, and then there's like a WiFi light that's on. Everything else is off.

Agent: Okay, so the internet light should ideally be solid white or blue, not blinking. That typically indicates it's not getting a connection. Let me walk you through checking the cables. Can you see where the main cable comes into your modem?

Customer: Yeah, the one from outside? (background noise) It's plugged in. I can see it.

Agent: Good. Is it pushed in all the way? Sometimes it gets a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, let me check... I'm gonna push it in a bit more just to be sure. (rustling sound) Okay, I... I pressed on it. Still blinking though.

Agent: Alright. And just to be thorough, is there a coaxial cable that connects to the back of the modem?

Customer: I think so? There's a cable that looks kind of like... it's got a metal connector on it.

Agent: Yes, that's the one. Is it plugged in securely as well?

Customer: Yeah, it's in there. I'm looking at it right now.

Agent: Okay. Let me check on something here. (typing sounds, pause) James, I'm going to check if we need to send a technician out, but first let me do one more thing. I'm going to send a reboot signal to your modem from here. This might take a moment. Go ahead and keep watching it.

Customer: Okay. (pause) How long should this take?

Agent: Should be just a moment. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, signal sent. (pause) You should see the lights flicker or go dark briefly.

Customer: (pause) ...Nope. Nothing changed. Still the same.

Agent: Hmm, okay. (pause) Let me try one more troubleshooting step. Can you unplug the modem again, but this time also unplug the power cable to the router if you have one?

Customer: Do I have a router? Like a separate device?

Agent: It might be the same unit or a separate box. If you only have one device, then the modem is doing both functions. Either way, unplug whatever you have for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (sounds of unplugging) Alright, it's unplugged. Everything's dark now. I'm counting... (pause) ...okay, thirty seconds. (sound of plugging in) Plugged it back in.

Agent: Alright, let's see if that helps. Give it about ninety seconds this time to fully restart. (extended pause) Anything?

Customer: (long pause) ...No. Same thing as before. The internet light is still just blinking. This doesn't look good, does it?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, it does seem like there might be a hardware issue or a line problem that we can't resolve remotely. I'm not seeing any issues on our end, and we've tried the standard troubleshooting steps.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long until I can get internet back?

Agent: Well, I can absolutely schedule a technician to come out and take a look at your equipment and check the line. Would you be available this week for a visit?

Customer: Ugh, yeah, I guess so. When's the earliest?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. We have an opening... tomorrow between 1 and 4 PM, or Thursday morning between 8 and 11 AM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon works, I guess. But I really need this fixed quickly. I have a client call on Friday.

Agent: I completely understand. Hopefully the technician will be able to get you back up and running tomorrow. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I have you down for tomorrow, between 1 and 4 PM. A technician will come to your address at 527 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. The technician's name will come through in that message, and there will also be a tracking number so you can see when they're on their way. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Just... hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I hope so too, James. I apologize that we couldn't resolve this remotely today. The technician will be able to run more comprehensive diagnostics. Is there a number where they can reach you tomorrow if needed?

Customer: The number on the account should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for your patience with us today. Your ticket number is 4847621 if you need to reference anything. We appreciate your business with Frontier.

Customer: Thanks, I guess. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day, James.
