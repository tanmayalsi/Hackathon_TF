Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi, um, my internet just went out completely. I've been without it for like the past hour and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing your account here under Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So you're experiencing a complete outage—no internet at all at the moment?

Customer: Right, nothing. Not a single light on the modem. Well, actually, let me... (pause) no, there's one light that's sort of blinking red. Is that normal?

Agent: The red blinking light actually indicates there might be a connection issue. That's helpful information. Before we go too far down the troubleshooting road, have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time something like this has happened?

Customer: No, first time. I mean, I've had internet for about two years with you guys and it's been pretty solid until now.

Agent: Good to know. Alright, so let's start with the basics. Can you tell me what you're seeing on your modem right now? How many lights are on it, and what colors are they?

Customer: Okay, so... I'm looking at it now. There's a light on the top that's green and solid. Then there's one next to it that's blinking red. And then there's like... I don't know, three or four others that are off completely.

Agent: Perfect, that helps. So the green light being solid is actually good—that means your modem has power. But that red blinking light on the second one tells me there's likely a connection problem between your modem and our network. First thing I want you to do is unplug the modem completely. Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let that sit for about thirty seconds. While we wait, can you tell me—did you happen to do any work on your router or modem recently? Any changes made to cables or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. I didn't touch anything. It was working fine this morning when I left for work, and when I got home it was just... gone.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful context. (pause) Alright, thirty seconds should be up. Can you plug the modem back in now?

Customer: Yeah, doing it now. (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Good. Go ahead and give it about a minute to boot back up. You should see the lights start to change. Let me know what you're seeing.

Customer: Um, yeah, the green light came back on. And now the red one is... it's still blinking red. The other lights are still off.

Agent: Okay, so we're still seeing that connection issue. The red light is persisting. Let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) I'm not showing any outages in your service area right now, so it's likely something specific to your connection. Can you check your cables for me? The cable coming out of the wall into your modem—is it plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks like it's plugged in pretty good. It's not loose or anything.

Agent: Alright, can you try unplugging it and plugging it back in? Just give it a firm connection.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, unplugging... and replugging. I hear a little click. 

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about thirty seconds again and see if that red light changes at all.

Customer: (pause) Still red and blinking.

Agent: Hmm, still seeing it? Okay. Robert, I want to try one more thing before we potentially escalate this. Let's do a factory reset on the modem. Now, this will take a few minutes, but it might clear up whatever's causing this connection error. Are you okay with trying that?

Customer: Yeah, sure, I'll try anything at this point.

Agent: Perfect. On the back of your modem, you should see a small recessed button, usually labeled "Reset." You might need a paperclip or a pen tip to press it. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. Okay, I'm pressing it... (pause) It's not really... I don't know if anything's happening. Should something be happening?

Agent: Hold it for about ten seconds. Keep it pressed.

Customer: Still holding... okay, I'm at about ten seconds. (pause) I'm releasing it now.

Agent: Great. Now the modem is going to restart and reconfigure itself. This might take two to three minutes. Why don't you give it a couple minutes and let me know when you see if that red light changes or if the other lights come on.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, so... I'm watching it. I see the green light is back on. But we're still... yep, still got the red blinking light. And now actually, I'm seeing a blue light turn on, but I think that might just be... I'm not sure what that is.

Agent: The blue light is typically the WiFi indicator, which is actually a good sign. So we're getting some activity. But that red light is still our issue. Robert, I've gone through all the standard troubleshooting steps here, and we're still seeing that persistent connection error. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to your location to investigate further. There might be an issue with your modem itself, or possibly something on the line side that our systems aren't detecting.

Customer: A technician? How long is that going to take? I really need my internet back soon. I work from home and I have a big presentation tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) The earliest I can get someone out to you would be tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? That's... that's better than nothing, I guess. But I won't have internet until then?

Agent: I'm sorry, I know it's not ideal. Unfortunately, with the troubleshooting we've done not resolving the issue, a technician visit is really your best option at this point. They'll be able to test the line and potentially swap out your modem if that's the issue.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, okay. Yeah, schedule it for tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that set up for you. You'll be all set for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Robert?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I'll just have to make do for tonight.

Agent: I really do apologize for the inconvenience. We appreciate your patience, and our technician will get this sorted out for you tomorrow. Your reference number for this ticket is 447892. Do you have that?

Customer: Yeah, 447892. Got it.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's everything.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for calling Frontier, Robert. We'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
