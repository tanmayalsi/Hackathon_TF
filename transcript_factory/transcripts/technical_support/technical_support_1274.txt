# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back up. I've been without it for like two hours now.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm pulling that up now. One second... Okay, got it. And you're saying your internet is completely down? Are you getting any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Yeah, um... let me look. (pause) The modem has like a red light on it. Is that bad?

Agent: Okay, so a red light typically means there's a connection issue. That's actually good information. Let's try some basic troubleshooting. First, I want you to unplug the modem from the wall outlet and wait about 30 seconds, then plug it back in. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Sure, one second. (background noise, rustling sounds) Unplugging it now...

Agent: Great, just let me know when you plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. Now what?

Agent: Perfect. Give it about a minute to boot back up. While we wait, can you tell me—have you had any storms in your area recently? Or have there been any changes to your setup?

Customer: No storms or anything. It was working fine when I went to bed last night. I just woke up this morning and it was dead.

Agent: Hmm, okay. (pause) Alright, give me a status update. What are you seeing on the modem now?

Customer: Um... still red. It's been like 40 seconds, right?

Agent: Yeah, that sounds about right. Let's give it another 30 seconds or so. Sometimes these things take a minute. So while we're waiting, just out of curiosity—do you have any other devices that need the internet right now? Or are you just checking on this?

Customer: No, but I need to work from home today, so... this is kind of urgent for me.

Agent: I totally understand. Okay, let me check on your account from my end. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, which is good news. And your account looks active. Let me pull up your modem... (pause) Alright, I'm going to send a signal to your modem remotely. That sometimes helps reset things.

Customer: Okay, cool. Um, is that doing anything?

Agent: Give it just a second... (pause) Okay, I've sent that through. Are you still looking at the modem?

Customer: Yeah, and um... (pause) ...nope. Still red. Wait, actually it's... no, it's still red.

Agent: Alright. Let's try something else. Let me get you to unplug the router as well. Do you have a separate router or is it all one unit?

Customer: It's separate. I have like a modem and then a router next to it.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and unplug the router for now, and we'll leave the modem unplugged for another 30 seconds as well. Then we'll do the modem first, wait for it to boot, and then do the router.

Customer: Okay, unplugging the router... (rustling sounds) Both are unplugged now.

Agent: Excellent. Let's give it 30 seconds... Actually, while we're waiting—I'm looking at your account history here. When was the last time you made any changes to your equipment or your service?

Customer: I don't know, like... months ago? I haven't really touched anything.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful. Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) It's in.

Agent: Great. Give it about 45 seconds to boot up this time. I know this is annoying, but—

Customer: Yeah, it's fine. I'm just... I'm hoping this works.

Agent: I hear you. Okay, what are we looking at now?

Customer: (pause) Still red.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay, let's think about this. Can you tell me what model modem you have? There should be a sticker on top of it.

Customer: (pause) It says... "Technicolor TC4400"? I think?

Agent: [inaudible] Let me see... (typing) Okay, so that's a solid modem on our end. And the router—do you know what kind that is?

Customer: It's... a NETGEAR. I don't know the model.

Agent: That's fine, that's fine. Okay, go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: Got it. (pause) Plugging it back in...

Agent: Alright, let that boot up as well. This should take about a minute or two. While we're waiting, I want to ask—is there any way you can check if there's a coax cable connection at the wall? Like, the cable that connects to your modem?

Customer: The coax? Um... (pause) Yeah, I can see it back there. Looks like it's connected.

Agent: Okay, good. And does it look like it's screwed in pretty tight, or does it look loose at all?

Customer: Looks tight to me.

Agent: (pause) Alright. So let me be honest with you here. We've tried the basic resets and I'm still not seeing your modem come online on my end, which suggests that there might be a physical issue with the line coming into your house, or possibly the modem itself has failed.

Customer: Oh no. So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. We can schedule a technician to come out and check the line and your equipment. Or, we could try a couple more troubleshooting steps, but... (pause) ...I'm going to be real with you. The red light usually means it's not getting a signal from our network.

Customer: How long would it take to get a technician out here?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) So I'm looking at our schedule... What's your availability looking like? Are you home today?

Customer: Yeah, I'm home. I need to be for work, obviously. Can they come today?

Agent: (pause) It looks like we have an opening this afternoon. Between 2 and 4 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works. But like, what should I do in the meantime? Just... leave everything unplugged?

Agent: Actually, go ahead and leave it plugged in. Even though it's showing a red light, I want the modem to stay powered on. That way, if anything changes, at least it's attempting to communicate with the network. And... (pause) ...let me try one more thing. Let me send another remote signal to reset the modem.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I've done that. Can you keep an eye on those lights and just... let me know if anything changes at all?

Customer: I'm looking right at it. (pause) Nope. Still red.

Agent: Yeah, that's... that's what I expected, unfortunately. Alright, so here's what we're going to do. I'm going to get a technician scheduled for you this afternoon. Let me just confirm your address real quick. (typing) I have you at 447 Maple Street, apartment 3B?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And a phone number where they can reach you?

Customer: It's 555-0149.

Agent: (typing) Got it. Alright, so I have you scheduled for a technician visit between 2 and 4 PM today. The tech will either repair or replace your modem, or investigate any line issues. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I guess not. I mean... is there any chance it just starts working again on its own?

Agent: (pause) I mean, it's possible, but unlikely given what we've tried. These things are usually pretty straightforward. I'd say there's probably something hardware-related going on. The tech will sort it out though.

Customer: Alright, well... thank you, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm sorry about this. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: You're all set. You should receive a confirmation email or text about your appointment. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
