Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I have a work call in like an hour.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. So your internet went down this morning, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, around 8 AM maybe? I tried restarting the router but nothing's changed. The lights on the box are all red or not on at all, I'm not really sure what's normal.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. So when you say the lights are red or off... can you describe exactly what you're seeing right now? Like, which lights are on and which ones are off?

Customer: Um... (pause) there's one that's like blinking red on the left side, and then the rest are just... dark. Is that bad?

Agent: Okay, so the one blinking red is actually a warning indicator. That typically means there's a signal issue coming into your modem. Before we go further, have you checked to make sure all the cables are plugged in securely? Sometimes they can come loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me... let me check that. (rustling sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at the back of the modem here. There's a cable coming in from the wall, and it looks pretty tight to me, but let me just... (tugging sounds) ...make sure it's really in there.

Agent: Good idea. Try jiggling it a little bit and see if any of those lights change.

Customer: Hmm, nothing's happening. Still the same red light blinking.

Agent: Alright. And you mentioned you already restarted the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I unplugged it and waited like thirty seconds and plugged it back in.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, let me try a couple other things here. When the modem was booting back up, did you see the lights cycle through different colors? Like, do you remember seeing green at any point?

Customer: I... honestly, I didn't really pay attention to that. I just plugged it back in and waited. Should I try again and actually watch?

Agent: Yeah, that would actually be really helpful. Why don't you unplug it now and we'll watch the full boot cycle together. That way I can see if there's a pattern.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) How long should I wait?

Agent: Just about thirty seconds. I'll let you know when.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) ...this is a long thirty seconds. (nervous laugh)

Agent: (chuckles) I know, right? Okay, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: Plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, so... it's starting up. I'm seeing... blue? And there's some other light that's green. Um, green light on the right. And the blue one's... still going.

Agent: Okay, good. That's normal. Let it finish booting up. This should take about two or three minutes.

Customer: Alright. (pause) So... how much longer?

Agent: Just a bit. While we wait, let me ask you something. Have there been any recent storms in your area? Or any outages reported?

Customer: No, nothing that I've noticed. But I mean, I don't really check that stuff. Is there an outage?

Agent: Let me pull that up. (typing sounds) I'm not showing any active outages in your area right now, so that's a good sign. (pause) Okay, what are you seeing on the modem now?

Customer: Uh, everything's still kind of lit up. The blue light is still blinking, and there's the green one still on, but that red light is still there too.

Agent: Yeah, that red light is concerning. Okay, I'm going to try something on my end. I'm going to send a restart signal to your modem remotely. This should take about a minute. Just keep it plugged in and don't touch it.

Customer: Okay, I'm not touching anything.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) All right, sending that now. (pause) Give it about sixty seconds to restart.

Customer: (pause) So is this... is this something that happens a lot? Like, is this a known issue?

Agent: It can be a few different things. Usually when we're seeing that red light after a reboot, it's either a signal issue from the line side, or sometimes it can be the modem itself starting to go bad. But let's see if the remote restart helps. (pause) Okay, checking now... (typing sounds) Hm.

Customer: What? What's the "hm"? Is that bad?

Agent: No, no, sorry. I didn't mean to worry you. I'm just checking the status. The modem still shows that same error. So it looks like the remote restart didn't clear it. Let me ask you this—do you have a coax cable splitter anywhere in your setup? Like, anything that might be splitting the signal?

Customer: A... a what? A coax splitter?

Agent: It's a little device that looks like it has multiple cable ports. Usually brass colored. One cable comes in and then multiple cables branch off from it.

Customer: Um, I don't think so? I mean, I only have the one cable coming out of the wall. Just the one modem.

Agent: Okay, that's actually good. We can rule that out then. (pause) All right, I'm going to be honest with you. This red light typically indicates that we're not getting a proper signal from our network to your modem. That usually means either there's a problem on the line coming into your house, or potentially the modem itself is having an issue receiving the signal.

Customer: Oh. So like... what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, the best way to troubleshoot this properly would be to get a technician out to your location to check the line and the equipment. I can schedule that for you. We typically have availability within the next day or two depending on your area.

Customer: A technician? Like someone coming to my house? How much is that going to cost?

Agent: Since you're experiencing a service outage, there shouldn't be a service call charge. This would be covered under your service agreement. But I do need to let you know that if it turns out the issue is something inside your home—like a problem with your internal wiring—there could be a fee for that.

Customer: (pause) Well... I really need internet for work. Can someone come today?

Agent: Let me check what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) What's your zip code again? Actually, I have it here. So looking at today... (pause) we're actually pretty booked up. The earliest I'm showing for a same-day appointment is... (pause) ...6 PM to 8 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: I mean, I guess that could work, but what about this work call I have in an hour? Is there anything we can do before the technician gets there?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, with that red light persisting through all of our troubleshooting, I think the line issue is preventing the modem from even connecting. I wish I had another troubleshooting step we could try, but I think we've gone through the main ones. 

Customer: Okay... well, I guess I'll take that 6 to 8 PM slot. But I'm not happy about this. I'm paying for a service that's not working.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry we're dealing with this. Let me get you scheduled for that technician visit and I'll also make a note on your account about the urgency here.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Do I need to do anything?

Agent: Just have someone home at that time, and make sure the modem stays plugged in. The technician will have access to the line from outside, so they may need to go to the box on your house or on your street to check things out. And bring up what you're seeing on the modem when they arrive—that red light will be helpful for them to see.

Customer: All right. So... 6 to 8 PM today. Anything else I should know?

Agent: That should be it. You'll get a confirmation text and email shortly with the appointment details and the technician's direct number in case they need to reach you. Is your phone number [inaudible]—555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. I'm really sorry we couldn't get this working today before your call. Hopefully our technician will have you back up and running tonight.

Customer: Yeah, hopefully. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tonight.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
