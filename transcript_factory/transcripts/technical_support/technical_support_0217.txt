# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just completely stopped working about an hour ago. I've got no connection at all, and I need to get this fixed pretty quickly.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing your account here. So you're saying you have no internet connection at all right now?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. My WiFi isn't showing up, and I've tried... I don't know, restarting my phone and stuff. Nothing's working.

Agent: Alright, well let's start with the basics. First, can you tell me what you're seeing on your modem right now? Are there any lights on it, or is it completely dark?

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) Let me go look. I'm in the living room. The modem's in the bedroom.

Agent: No problem, take your time.

Customer: (background noise of footsteps) Okay, so... I'm looking at it now. There's a power light that's on. It's... it's green or something. But, uh, most of the other lights aren't on. Usually there's like, a blue light blinking, right?

Agent: Right, exactly. So that blue light represents your internet connection. The fact that it's not on means the modem isn't establishing a connection to our network. Have you experienced any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine this morning when I was checking my email.

Agent: Okay. Let's try a hard reboot of your modem. Can you locate the power cable on the back of it?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. 

Agent: Go ahead and unplug it for me, and then we'll wait about 30 seconds before plugging it back in.

Customer: (pause) Unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. And while we wait, can I ask, are you renting the modem from us or did you purchase your own?

Customer: I think it's one of yours. You guys set it up when the service was installed like... two years ago?

Agent: Got it. Okay, and 30 seconds should be up now. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause, then sound of plugging in) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now we're going to give it about two to three minutes to fully boot up and re-establish the connection. While we're waiting, do you see if any of those lights start changing?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, actually, I see one that's starting to blink now. There's like an orange light blinking.

Agent: Good, that's progress. That usually means it's trying to connect. Let's give it just a little bit more time.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Okay... still blinking. Is that... is that normal?

Agent: That's normal for the boot-up process, yes. It should establish a solid connection within the next minute or so. The light should turn blue once it connects. Why don't you check if you're getting a WiFi signal on your phone now?

Customer: (pause) Let me see... No, I'm not... wait, let me refresh this. No, still nothing.

Agent: Okay. And the light is still blinking?

Customer: Yeah, still orange.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing your modem online in our system right now either. That's interesting. Let me ask you this—did you notice anything strange before the internet went out? Any unusual activity or anything?

Customer: No, like I said, it was working this morning. I didn't do anything to it. And I haven't had any power issues or anything.

Agent: Understood. Okay, let's try another approach here. On the back of the modem, there should be a small reset button. It's usually recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something small to press it. Do you see that?

Customer: A reset button? I mean... I see a bunch of ports back there, but I'm not sure which one is the reset button. There's a lot of stuff.

Agent: It should be labeled "Reset" and it's usually smaller than the other openings. Give it a look.

Customer: (pause, background noise) I... I don't know. There's a lot back here. Is it the same as rebooting it? Because I just did that.

Agent: No, the reset button is different. A restart just reboots the system, but a reset actually clears the device's settings and restores it to factory defaults. But let's hold off on that for now since we want to avoid losing any configurations. Um, (pause) let me try something else first. Can you tell me if you're seeing an error message on your computer when you try to connect?

Customer: I don't have a computer plugged in right now. I was just checking on my phone.

Agent: Ah, okay. Could you plug in your computer or any other device with an ethernet cable if you have one? That way we can test a wired connection versus the wireless.

Customer: I... I don't have an ethernet cable. I just use WiFi for everything.

Agent: Alright, no worries. (typing sounds) You know what, let me pull up some diagnostics here on the modem. (pause) I'm actually seeing that the modem is trying to establish a connection, but it's getting an error code. It might be an issue with the line itself. Have there been any recent weather changes, or have any cables outside your home been disturbed recently?

Customer: I don't know. I haven't been outside or anything. But, um, there was someone doing construction a couple blocks away last week. Could that affect it?

Agent: It's possible, but unlikely unless they directly hit our lines. But it's worth noting. (pause) Listen, I'm going to try to send a reboot signal to your modem remotely from here. Just give me one second.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) Alright, I've sent that. Let's see if that helps. Give it another minute to boot back up.

Customer: (pause) The light's still orange.

Agent: Still orange?

Customer: Yeah. It was like that before too.

Agent: (pause) Okay, um... (typing sounds) I'm looking at the diagnostics again, and I'm actually not seeing the modem establishing a connection at all. This might be a hardware issue with the modem itself. How old did you say the equipment was?

Customer: Like two years? Maybe a little more?

Agent: Right. So, here's what I'm thinking. I've done what I can from my end, but the modem doesn't seem to be communicating with our network properly. We have a couple of options. We could schedule a technician to come out and look at the equipment and the line, or we could try swapping out the modem to see if that's the issue.

Customer: How long would a technician take? I really need my internet back. I've got work stuff I need to do at home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what appointments we have available. (pause, typing sounds) The earliest I can get someone out there would be... tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... okay, I guess that works, but that's pretty far out. Can't you do something sooner?

Agent: Unfortunately, that's the earliest availability I'm showing right now. I know it's not ideal. But honestly, given what I'm seeing here, I think a technician visit is going to be necessary. There might be an issue with the line outside your home that we need to investigate.

Customer: (frustrated) This is really frustrating. I needed my internet today.

Agent: I know, and I'm really sorry about that. This is definitely a frustrating situation. But I do want to be upfront with you—I've exhausted the basic troubleshooting steps on my end, and the modem isn't responding properly. A technician is going to be able to physically inspect the equipment and the line and get you back up and running.

Customer: Alright... (pause) Yeah, okay. Let's do the appointment tomorrow.

Agent: Perfect. So I have you down for tomorrow, Friday the 15th, between 2 and 5 PM. Is there anything else I should note on your account?

Customer: No, I mean... just try to get someone here sooner if you can?

Agent: I'll absolutely make a note of it. We may be able to call you if there's an opening earlier, so keep your phone handy. In the meantime, there's unfortunately not much more I can do remotely. But you should be all set tomorrow.

Customer: Okay. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. And again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright. You have a good day, and we'll see you tomorrow afternoon.

Customer: Yeah, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
