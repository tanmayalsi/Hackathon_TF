# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got some work I need to do from home and I'm kind of stuck here.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's area code 555, 287-4061.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And just to confirm, is this a residential account?

Customer: Yeah, residential. It's just me and my wife.

Agent: Perfect. So your internet is completely down right now—you're not seeing any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Well, the modem has some lights on it. There's like a green one and a red one, I think. They're just... they're not blinking like they usually do.

Agent: Okay, that's actually helpful information. So the green light is typically your power indicator, and the red one—that could be indicating an issue. Let me ask you this: when you look at your router, do you see any lights on there?

Customer: Uh, (pause) yeah, I see one light on the router but it's also red, I think. Or maybe orange? It's hard to tell with these lights.

Agent: Alright, so both devices have red or orange indicators. That usually suggests there might be a connection issue. Here's what I'd like you to try first, okay? Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Sure, holding on. (pause) Yeah, I unplugged it.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds while it powers down completely. Just give it a little time there.

Customer: (pause) Okay, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in, and let's see what happens. Can you tell me if the lights change at all?

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) Um, the green light is... yeah, it's back on now. But the red one is still there.

Agent: The red one is still lit?

Customer: Yeah, still there.

Agent: Okay, and is it solid red or is it blinking?

Customer: (pause) It looks solid to me. Just... sitting there.

Agent: Got it. That's what we typically see when there's a signal issue on the line. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a line test to see what we're picking up from your location.

Customer: Okay, how long does that take?

Agent: Should just be a minute or two. (pause) (typing sounds) Hmm, interesting. So I'm seeing that there's definitely no active signal coming to your address right now. That solid red light on the modem is confirming that. Let me ask—have you noticed any bad weather today, or any recent construction in your area?

Customer: Oh, actually, yeah. There were some guys working on the telephone poles down the street yesterday. I didn't think it was related to internet stuff, though.

Agent: That could definitely be it. They may have accidentally disconnected something during their work. Let me try a couple more things before we escalate this. Can you check your cabling for me? The cable that goes from the modem to the wall—is it plugged in securely on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm checking now. On the modem end it looks... wait, let me see. (pause) It feels pretty snug. Yeah, both ends look tight to me.

Agent: Okay, good. And do you see any visible damage to the cable itself? Any cuts or anything?

Customer: No, it looks fine. Looks normal.

Agent: Alright. Let me try rebooting your router as well. Can you unplug that for me?

Customer: Yeah, doing it now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: (pause) Okay, leave that unplugged for about a minute this time, and then we'll plug that back in too.

Customer: (pause) Alright, a minute's up. (pause) Plugging it back in. (pause) Same thing—lights are coming on, the green is there, but still that red light on the modem.

Agent: Okay, yeah, that confirms what I suspected. The issue is really coming from our line, not your equipment. (typing sounds) What I'm going to do is escalate this to our technical field team. Since there was construction in your area yesterday, it's very likely that our lines were damaged or disconnected during that work.

Customer: Oh, okay. So what does that mean? How long before it gets fixed?

Agent: So a field technician will need to come out to your address and inspect the line. They'll either repair what was damaged or reconnect everything properly. I can schedule someone to come out tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM if that works for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't they come today? I really need this working.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, our field teams are booked solid for today. It's a pretty busy day for us. But tomorrow morning is the earliest I can get someone out there.

Customer: (sighs) Alright, I guess that's fine. Tomorrow morning works.

Agent: Great. Let me get some details from you then. Is there a mobile number where we can reach you if the technician needs to contact you?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-287-4089.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got that down. So to confirm, we have a technician scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM at your address. Someone will either call or text you if they need any additional information. The work order is being flagged as a priority due to the recent construction.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything I should do in the meantime?

Agent: You can try keeping both your modem and router unplugged and then plugging them back in once more before you go to bed tonight, just in case something resolves overnight, but I'm pretty confident the issue is external on our end. So honestly, you'll probably still be without service until the technician arrives.

Customer: Alright, I'll give that a shot. I appreciate your help, Derek.

Agent: Of course. And again, I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. You should be up and running again by tomorrow afternoon. If you need anything else or if you want to check on your service appointment, you can always call us back at the number on your bill.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see you tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
