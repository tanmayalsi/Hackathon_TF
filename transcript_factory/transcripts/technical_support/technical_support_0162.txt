# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and everything but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm pulling that up now. And your name?

Customer: It's Michael. Michael Reeves.

Agent: Great, Michael. Thanks. (pause) Alright, I've got your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 100 plan. So let me ask you a few quick questions. When you say the internet went out, are you seeing any lights on the modem at all?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, actually. There's like a red light on the front. It's usually blue or something, so that's definitely not normal.

Agent: Okay, that's actually helpful information. The red light typically indicates either a connection issue or a power issue. Can you tell me... is the modem plugged in? I know it sounds obvious, but—

Customer: (laughs) No, I checked that already. It's plugged in. The power cord's all the way in.

Agent: Good, good. Okay, and do you have a backup battery on the modem, or is it just plugged directly into the wall?

Customer: It's just plugged into the wall.

Agent: Alright. Let's try a hard reset. What I want you to do is unplug the modem from the wall outlet, and then wait for about thirty seconds before plugging it back in.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Unplugged. I'm gonna wait... (longer pause) Thirty seconds should be about up. Plugging it back in... (pause) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Perfect. Give it about two minutes to fully restart and reboot. While we're waiting, let me just ask—have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, first time. I've had Frontier for about two years now and it's been pretty solid until today.

Agent: That's great to know. Okay, and have you noticed anything else unusual? Like, did you hear any storms last night or anything that might have caused an issue?

Customer: Actually, yeah. There was a pretty bad thunderstorm last night. Real loud. I didn't think about it until you asked, but that could definitely be it.

Agent: That could very well be it. Lightning can sometimes cause issues with the modem or the line coming into your house. (pause) Alright, Michael, what's the status now? Are you seeing any different lights?

Customer: Um... (pause) I'm looking at it now. Still red. Maybe a little bit of yellow blinking next to it, but it's still mostly red.

Agent: Okay, the yellow blinking is actually good—that means it's trying to connect. Let's give it another minute or so. Sometimes after a storm it takes a little longer to establish the connection to our network.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Still the same though. Red and yellow.

Agent: Alright, let me try a different approach. Do you have a computer or phone nearby that you can connect to the modem? What I'd like to do is check if we can access the modem's diagnostic page.

Customer: Yeah, I've got my laptop right here. But the WiFi isn't working either, so how would I...?

Agent: Good question. Do you have an ethernet cable? That's the cable with the little rectangular connector?

Customer: Uh, maybe? Let me look. (pause) I don't think so, actually. I've been WiFi-only for a while now.

Agent: That's okay, that's okay. No problem. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your line status here and... hmm. (pause) Michael, I'm not actually seeing your modem connected to our network right now, which would explain the red light.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it broken?

Agent: Not necessarily. It could be a few things. The storm might have damaged the equipment, or there could be an issue with the line coming into your house. Have you noticed any damage outside your house? Like to the cable box or anything?

Customer: I haven't really looked. Do I need to go outside?

Agent: If you don't mind, yeah. Just take a quick look and see if there's any visible damage—like melted plastic, burnt marks, anything like that. The line usually comes in on the side or back of the house.

Customer: (pause) Okay, hold on. (background noise of door opening) (pause) (door closes) Okay, I'm back. I went out and looked but I don't really see anything obvious. I mean, I'm not an electrician, so...

Agent: (laughs) Yeah, that's alright. Okay, let me check one more thing. (typing sounds) (longer pause) Michael, I'm going to be honest with you. The modem really should be connected by now if it was just a temporary glitch. And given the storm, it's possible the equipment needs to be replaced. 

Customer: So... what are you saying? Is my modem fried?

Agent: I can't say for certain from here, but it's looking like we might need to send a technician out to your house to properly diagnose what's going on. It could be the modem, it could be the line, or it could be something at the network level. But I want to get someone out there who can physically check everything.

Customer: Okay, so how long is that gonna take? I really need to get back online. I work from home and I've already lost like an hour.

Agent: I completely understand. (typing sounds) Let me check our availability for you. (pause) I can get a technician scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. Or... it looks like we might have an opening later today, around 5 PM, but I can't guarantee that one.

Customer: Today at 5? That's better. Can you do that?

Agent: Let me see if I can lock that in for you. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, actually, I'm having trouble confirming that slot right now. How about I schedule you for tomorrow morning, 8 to noon, and if we get a cancellation today, I'll give you a call and see if we can move you up?

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, I guess that's fine. Can I at least get a credit for today or something?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me put a note on your account that you experienced an outage today due to storm damage. When the technician comes out and gets everything resolved, they can actually initiate a credit right then and there, or you can call us back and we can apply it.

Customer: Alright, I mean, it's not ideal, but okay. Tomorrow morning then.

Agent: Exactly. So that's tomorrow, [inaudible] to noon. You should get a confirmation email in the next few minutes. The technician will have all the information they need about the potential storm damage. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: I guess just... is there any way I can get internet working before tomorrow? Like, is there anything else I can try?

Agent: (pause) Well, you could try one more restart if you want, but honestly, Michael, if the modem isn't connecting to our network, it's not going to come back online without either new equipment or a line inspection. Do you have any neighbors or a local coffee shop you could work from for the next few hours?

Customer: Yeah, there's a coffee shop nearby, I guess. I could go there.

Agent: That might be your best bet for today. I'm really sorry I couldn't get this fixed for you remotely. But the good news is our technicians are great, and they'll get you back up and running tomorrow morning.

Customer: Alright. Thanks for trying, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: Of course, Michael. Sorry again about the outage. We'll see you tomorrow. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
