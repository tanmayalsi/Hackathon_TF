Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um... my internet just went out completely. It's been down for about twenty minutes now and I've got no connection at all.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get this sorted out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's area code 503, then 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Got it. I'm showing an account for Michael Torres at 4421 Riverside Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage right now?

Customer: Yeah, total outage. The router's on, the modem's on—they're both lit up—but there's just no internet. I can't get on my laptop or my phone won't connect either.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let's try a few quick troubleshooting steps. First, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your modem right now? Are they green, blinking, red...?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) The power light is solid green. The internet light is... it's like a yellow or orange color. And there's one that's just blinking green.

Agent: Okay, so the internet light being yellow or orange typically means there's no connection coming from our side. But before we assume that, let's do a quick restart. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, doing that now.

Agent: Great. Just leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) It's been like thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in and let's see what happens.

(pause)

Customer: Alright, it's powering back up. (pause) Lights are coming on... power's green... and now... the internet light is still orange. Still yellow-orange.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm not showing any service outages in your area, which is good. Do you have a landline with us or just the internet service?

Customer: Just the internet. I'm on my phone right now, actually—that's cell service.

Agent: Right, got it. Um, can you also check your router? Is it showing any lights or any errors?

Customer: (pause) The power light is on, it's green. The WiFi light is green. But the internet light on the router—the one that usually shows the connection—that one's off. Or it's not lit up anyway.

Agent: Okay, so the router isn't getting a signal from the modem. Let me try something else. Can you restart the router as well? Just unplug it and give it about thirty seconds.

Customer: Sure. (pause) Unplugging now... (pause) [inaudible] ...thirty seconds... (pause) Plugging it back in.

Agent: (pause) And how are the lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Power's on, WiFi light is green, but... the internet light is still off. It's not lighting up.

Agent: Alright. And you mentioned the modem internet light is still orange?

Customer: Yeah, still orange or yellow. It hasn't changed.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Let me pull up some diagnostics on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm going to check the connection status on your modem... (pause) Hmm. So from what I'm seeing, it looks like your modem is not communicating with our network equipment. This could be a few different things—it could be the modem itself, it could be an issue with the line coming into your house, or it could be something on our end.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: Well, let's try one more thing. Can you check the cable connection on the back of your modem? Just make sure that the coaxial cable—it's the cable that looks like a little cylinder with threads on it—just make sure it's firmly connected.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It seems pretty tight to me.

Agent: Can you try unscrewing it just a little bit and then screwing it back in real tight? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that... (pause) Got it tightened up. Should I restart the modem again?

Agent: Yeah, let's do that. Go ahead.

(pause)

Customer: Unplugging... (pause) Plugging back in... (pause) Let me see what happens here... (pause) Okay, power's green, but the internet light is still... still orange.

Agent: (pause) Still the same?

Customer: Yeah, it's not changing. Same as before.

Agent: Okay, let me check something else. Are you near the modem right now? Do you see a reset button?

Customer: Um... there's a button here that says "reset" but it's like in a little hole.

Agent: Right, yeah, that's the one. We can try a factory reset, but before we do that, I want to make sure—that will reset your modem back to factory settings. You'd have to set up your internet connection again. But let's try that. You'll need like a paperclip to press it.

Customer: Hold on. (pause) Got a paperclip. (pause) Okay, I'm pushing it... (pause) The lights went out and they're coming back on now. Is that normal?

Agent: Yeah, that's normal. It's restarting. Give it about two minutes to fully boot back up.

(pause)

Customer: Alright, I'm giving it a couple minutes here...

Agent: Take your time.

(pause - approximately 90 seconds of silence with occasional background noise)

Customer: Okay, it's been like two minutes. The lights are all on now. Power's green, the internet light is... it's still orange.

Agent: (pause) Still orange, huh? 

Customer: Yeah. I don't know what else to do here.

Agent: (pause) I know this is frustrating. Let me check one more time on the network side. (typing sounds) Let me see if I can remotely reset your modem from here... (pause - typing sounds) Alright, I'm sending a reset command now. Can you watch the lights on your modem?

Customer: (pause) Okay, they just flashed. Like all of them blinked at once.

Agent: Good, that means it went through. Let it cycle back up again. This might take about three to five minutes.

(pause - approximately 2 minutes)

Customer: Still waiting...

Agent: Still cycling?

Customer: Yeah, still cycling. (pause) Okay, now the lights are... they're staying on. Power's green, WiFi is green, and the internet light is... (pause) ...it's still orange.

Agent: (pause, sigh) Alright, I'm... I'm going to be honest with you, Michael. We've tried a few different things here and the fact that it's not changing is telling me that this is likely an issue on our infrastructure side or there's a hardware problem with the modem itself. 

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, at this point, I think we need to get a technician out to your location to physically check the line coming into your house and potentially replace the modem. 

Customer: How long before someone can come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability... (typing sounds) (pause) I'm seeing that we have availability tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM, or we have Thursday morning between 8 and 12. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon is better. Can you do that?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to schedule a technician for tomorrow, December 14th, between 12 and 4 PM. Is that address at 4421 Riverside Drive still current?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. The technician's name will be... (typing sounds) ...it looks like it'll be Marcus. He'll have all your account information. You don't need to do anything else, but just make sure someone's home to let him in.

Customer: Okay, and how much is this going to cost me?

Agent: Since we've gone through troubleshooting and it appears to be a service issue on our end or equipment failure, there should be no charge for the service call. 

Customer: Alright, that's good.

Agent: I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all the details. Should arrive within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. I apologize for the inconvenience, and we'll get you back online tomorrow. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
