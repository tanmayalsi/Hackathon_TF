# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... I'm calling because my internet went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Morrison.

Agent: Perfect, thank you, James. I see your account here. So the internet completely stopped working about an hour ago, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. One minute it was fine and the next thing I know, nothing. The modem lights are... uh... they're kind of doing weird stuff. Some are blinking, some aren't on at all.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me ask you a few questions. Can you tell me which lights are on and which ones are off?

Customer: Um, so there's a power light that's on—that one's solid green. But then the internet light, or whatever it's called, that one's not on at all. And there's like a third light that's blinking red.

Agent: Alright, so we have a solid green power light, which is good. The internet light being off is typically what we'd see if there's a connection issue. And the red blinking light—that usually indicates an error of some kind. Before we go further, have you tried the standard troubleshooting steps? Like unplugging the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I did that already. I unplugged it, waited like... I don't know, thirty seconds or so, and plugged it back in. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, good. And how long did you wait? Sometimes it takes a couple of minutes for the modem to fully boot back up and reconnect to our network.

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) ...maybe just thirty seconds like I said. Should I try waiting longer?

Agent: Yeah, why don't we do that. Go ahead and unplug the modem again, and this time let's wait for about two to three minutes. That'll give it time to fully power down and reset.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (sound of movement) Alright, unplugged.

Agent: Great. I'll wait here with you.

Customer: (pause) This is so annoying. I work from home, so I really need this working.

Agent: I totally understand. Hopefully we'll get you back online in just a few minutes. So you mentioned you work from home—are you on any important calls or meetings right now?

Customer: No, thank God. But I have a conference call in like forty-five minutes, so...

Agent: Okay, so we've got a little bit of time. That's good. Go ahead and plug the modem back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Alright, it's plugged back in. The power light's coming back on... still green. Now we're waiting for the internet light?

Agent: Yeah, exactly. Just give it a minute or so to fully boot up and establish a connection. What you should see is the internet light will turn solid green or blue, depending on your model.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) ...I'm still just seeing the red blinking light and the green power light. It's been like... what, a minute now?

Agent: Let's give it another thirty seconds or so. Sometimes it takes a bit longer. While we wait, let me ask—have there been any storms in your area recently or any construction going on?

Customer: Um, no storms that I know of. There was some work on the telephone poles a few blocks away yesterday, but... I mean, that shouldn't have affected anything, right?

Agent: Well, sometimes work on the lines can impact service. But usually we'd see that documented in the system. Let me check if there are any outages or maintenance notifications in your area. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any active outages reported right now in your neighborhood, so that's a good sign.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it just my modem then?

Agent: It could be the modem, or it could be something with the connection to your home. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. What do you see on the modem right now?

Customer: Same thing. Red blinking light, green power light. That's it.

Agent: Okay, and you're sure the internet light isn't lighting up at all?

Customer: Pretty sure. There's like... (pause) ...no, nothing. Just those two lights.

Agent: Alright, let me try a few other things. Is there an Ethernet cable running from your modem to a router or a computer?

Customer: Yeah, there's a cable going to my router.

Agent: Can you check the connection on that cable? Sometimes they can wiggle loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, checking... Yeah, it looks pretty secure to me. Both ends are plugged in tight.

Agent: Alright. And what about the cable coming into the modem from the wall? Can you check that one too?

Customer: (sound of movement) Yeah, that one also looks... it's plugged in. Seems fine.

Agent: Great. Okay, James, I'm going to try something on my end. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem from here. Just give me a second. (typing sounds) Alright, sending that now. You might see the lights flicker or change. Just let me know what happens.

Customer: (pause) Okay... yeah, they flickered. But now we're back to the same thing. Red blinking, green solid.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Alright, let me try one more thing. Can you do a hard reset on the modem? There should be a small reset button, usually on the back. It might be recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something to press it.

Customer: Oh, okay. (sound of searching) I've got a paperclip. Let me just... (pause) ...find the button here. I think I see it. It's on the back, right?

Agent: Yeah, on the back. Just press it for about ten to fifteen seconds.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Alright, pressing it. (pause) And... the lights went out. Now they're coming back on. Still just the same lights as before though.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the modem signals on my end here, and I'm not getting a connection from your unit at all. It's not showing up on our network.

Customer: That doesn't sound good.

Agent: Well, there could be a few things going on. It could be a hardware issue with the modem, or there could be something with the connection line coming into your home. Let me ask you this—when the internet went out, did you hear any loud noises or see any activity outside? Or did the modem make any unusual sounds?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just... working, and then it wasn't.

Agent: Alright. Unfortunately, based on what I'm seeing on my end and the troubleshooting we've done, I'm not able to get your modem to reconnect to our network from here. The device isn't registering on our system at all.

Customer: So what does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: It's possible. But I want to be honest with you—it could also be a line issue or something with the connection to your home that I can't diagnose over the phone. At this point, I think we need to have a technician come out and take a look at things. They'll be able to check the line, the connection, and the modem to figure out exactly what's going on.

Customer: Really? How long would that take to set up? And is there a charge for that?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) So, we do have appointments available. I can get someone out there as early as tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have some slots later this week if that doesn't work. And since this is likely a service issue, there shouldn't be a charge for the technician visit. Now, if it turns out to be a modem issue—meaning it's just the device itself—we might charge you for a replacement modem, but that depends on a few factors.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better than waiting. Let me do that.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. What's the best number to reach you at?

Customer: 555-0147—that's the same as before.

Agent: Great. So I have you down for tomorrow between 8 and 12 noon. A technician will come out and assess the situation. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly with all the details. The technician's number will be in there too, so you can call if you need to.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Is there anything I should try in the meantime?

Agent: You can try leaving the modem unplugged and plugged back in one more time before bed tonight, just in case something resets overnight. But honestly, I wouldn't spend too much time troubleshooting at this point. The technician will be the best person to figure this out.

Customer: Alright. Well, I hope they can get it working because I really need it for work.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sure we'll get this sorted out for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying.

Agent: Of course, James. I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online today, but we'll make sure a tech gets to you tomorrow. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
