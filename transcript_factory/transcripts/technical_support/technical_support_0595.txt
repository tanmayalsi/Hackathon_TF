Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got work stuff I need to do and it's really frustrating.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how inconvenient that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I'm showing an active service at that address. So your internet just went down about an hour ago—was there anything unusual happening before it stopped? Like a storm or a power outage?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine and then suddenly nothing. The router's still lit up though, like it's still on, but I'm not getting any internet.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. I want you to look at your modem—that's the box from us, the Frontier box. Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Um, yeah. I see... there's a green light and then there's like a red light blinking.

Agent: Okay, so the red blinking light—that's actually indicating an issue with the connection. Here's what I want you to do. Can you unplug the modem for about thirty seconds? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (pause) Unplugging it now.

Agent: (pause) Great. Go ahead and count to about thirty, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay... and we're plugged back in. Now what?

Agent: Now we're just gonna give it about two minutes to boot back up. While we're waiting, can you tell me—are you using WiFi or are you hardwired in with an ethernet cable?

Customer: WiFi. I'm on my laptop right now.

Agent: Alright, so go ahead and try opening a website or... (pause) Actually, let's give it just another minute or so. Sometimes these take a little bit to fully initialize.

Customer: (pause) Okay, still nothing. The lights are... there's a green light, and now that red light is still blinking.

Agent: Still blinking, okay. Hmm. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) So I'm not seeing any service issues in your area, which is good news. That usually means it's something with your specific modem or connection. Let's try a different approach. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? There should be a small reset button on the back. It might be recessed, so you might need a paperclip or a pen to press it.

Customer: A factory reset? Will that... I don't know, will that mess anything up?

Agent: No, no, it's actually pretty standard. It'll just restore it to factory settings. We'll have to re-enter your WiFi password after, but that's all. It won't affect your service or anything like that.

Customer: Okay, let me... yeah, I see a little button back here. (pause) I'm pressing it now.

Agent: How long are you holding it for?

Customer: Maybe five seconds?

Agent: Actually, try holding it for about ten to fifteen seconds. Just hold it down a bit longer.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... and I'll let go. (pause) Now what?

Agent: Now let's wait about a minute for it to fully reset and boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's rebooting. I can see... there's a lot of light activity on the modem now.

Agent: Good, that's what we want to see. (pause) Okay, go ahead and try connecting to your WiFi now. You should see a default network name pop up.

Customer: (pause) I see it. It says "Frontier" something. Let me try to connect... (pause) Okay, I'm in, but... hold on, let me try to load a website. (pause) No, nothing. It's still not working.

Agent: Okay, still no connection. Alright, let me check a few more things on my end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me—when you look at the modem right now, what color are the lights? And which ones are blinking?

Customer: Um, there's green, and the red one is still blinking.

Agent: The red is still blinking. And do you see any other lights? Like an internet light or an online light?

Customer: I... I'm not really sure which light is which, to be honest.

Agent: No worries. Is the green light solid or is it blinking?

Customer: The green one is solid. It's just that red one that's blinking.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Well, that red light should go away once we get a connection established. Let me... (pause) Actually, I'm wondering if this might be a line issue on our end. Let me check your line status here. (typing sounds) Hmm... I'm not seeing any alerts, but sometimes the system takes a minute to update. Can I put you on a brief hold? I want to check with our network team real quick.

Customer: Yeah, okay, no problem.

Agent: Thank you. I'll be right back.

(hold music plays for approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Hey, thanks for holding. Okay, so I talked to our network tech, and he's not seeing anything obviously wrong on the line. But he did say that sometimes these Frontier gateways can be finicky. Have you tried just... restarting the modem one more time without doing the factory reset? Just a hard reboot?

Customer: I just did the factory reset though, like thirty seconds ago.

Agent: Right, right. I know. But let's just give it another shot. Sometimes they need a minute to settle.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, unplugging it again. (pause) Waiting... (pause) And plugging back in.

Agent: (pause) How are you feeling about trying this? I know it's frustrating.

Customer: Yeah, it's... it's pretty annoying. I really need to get some work stuff done.

Agent: I totally understand. Trust me, I get it.

(pause)

Customer: Okay, it's booting back up. The lights are doing their thing again. (pause) Alright, let me try to connect to the WiFi again and... (pause) No. Still nothing. It's like the internet connection just isn't there.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I have to be honest with you—we may be dealing with something that's outside of what I can troubleshoot over the phone. It's possible there's an issue with the line itself, or there could be something wrong with the modem hardware. Typically what I would recommend at this point is we either need to get a technician out to your location to diagnose the issue properly, or we could try shipping you a replacement modem to see if that fixes it.

Customer: A technician would take how long?

Agent: So, depending on your area and our schedule, that could be anywhere from tomorrow to maybe three business days out. I can check what's available if you'd like?

Customer: And the replacement modem?

Agent: The replacement would ship out today, so it would probably arrive in two to three business days as well, depending on your location.

Customer: Hmm. Neither one of those options is really great right now. I need this working today if possible.

Agent: (pause) I understand. Unfortunately, without being able to diagnose this further remotely, those are really your options. I wish I had a faster solution for you. Let me see... (typing sounds) We could potentially get a technician out tomorrow. Would that work for you?

Customer: I mean... I guess that's better than three days. Yeah, let's do tomorrow if we can.

Agent: Okay, let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm showing we have an appointment available between 8 AM and 12 PM tomorrow. Would that time window work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. That's actually perfect.

Agent: Great. So I'm going to get that scheduled for you. I'll need to confirm your address one more time. What's the address on your account?

Customer: 447 Maple Street, apartment 3B.

Agent: 447 Maple, apartment 3B. Got it. And we have a callback number of... (pause) 555-0847?

Customer: Yep, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So your technician appointment is confirmed for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. You should receive a confirmation email shortly, and our technician will diagnose the issue when they arrive. In the meantime, just keep trying to avoid using the modem too much, and if anything changes, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Okay. And if it turns out it's just the modem, you can replace it then, right?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. The technician will be able to replace it on the spot if that's what's needed. Or they might find it's something else entirely. But they'll have you covered either way.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today, but I'm confident our technician will take good care of you tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and sorry again for the inconvenience. Have a good night.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
