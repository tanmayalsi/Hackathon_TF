# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I work from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. I'm seeing your account here. And you said your internet went down this morning?

Customer: Yeah, started around 8 AM. I was just sitting here working and suddenly everything stopped loading. I tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in, but that didn't help.

Agent: Alright, that's good that you already tried that. Let me ask you a few questions. Are you seeing any lights on the modem right now? Like, is it powered on at all?

Customer: Um, yeah, I'm looking at it now. There's... there's a light, but it's just red. I think it's normally blue or something?

Agent: Okay, so we're seeing a red light. That tells me the modem might not be syncing properly with our network. Let me have you try something for me. Can you unplug the modem completely—not the router, just the modem—wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in?

Customer: Sure, okay. (pause) Unplugging it now. (pause, pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just count to about 30 seconds in your head, and then we'll plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, 30 seconds should be about... now. Plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, it's back on. The lights are... they're doing the thing where they're blinking.

Agent: Perfect. That's actually normal. The modem goes through a startup sequence. Let me have you wait about two to three minutes while it boots up completely. In the meantime, can you tell me if you've experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, first time. I mean, I've had the service for like three years and it's usually pretty reliable. This is weird.

Agent: Good to know. Okay, let's give it another minute or so. Are you seeing any changes in the lights yet?

Customer: (pause) Uh, some of them are still blinking. One looks like it might be solid now? It's hard to tell.

Agent: That's good progress. Let me actually check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm checking for any service issues or alerts on your line... Okay, I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported in your area, so this seems to be isolated to your account. Can you try checking if you can get online yet? Just try opening a website or something.

Customer: (pause) Holding on. Let me grab my laptop. (pause) Okay, I'm trying to open Google and... no, nothing. It's still saying "no internet." The page won't even load.

Agent: Okay. Let me check the status of your modem from here. (typing sounds, pause) I'm seeing that your modem is... hmm, that's strange. I'm seeing it's registered on our network now, but it's not showing an active data connection.

Customer: What does that mean? Like, is it a hardware thing?

Agent: It could be a few things. It might be an issue with the modem itself, or it could be something with the line coming into your house. Let me try a few more things. First, can you check the cables for me? The cable that comes from the wall into the modem—is it plugged in firmly?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It looks pretty secure to me. It's plugged in.

Agent: Okay, good. And the other end of that cable, where it connects to the wall—is there anything visible there that looks loose or damaged?

Customer: (pause) No, looks normal. I mean, it's just the outlet.

Agent: Alright. Let me try rebooting the modem from my end. This will take about thirty seconds.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Wait, do I need to do anything?

Agent: No, just stand by. I'm doing it from here. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, give me about thirty seconds for that to complete... (pause) And... rebooting now. Should be done in just a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay, the lights are going crazy now. They're all blinking.

Agent: That's normal. It's restarting. Let's wait for it to settle. (pause) Any changes?

Customer: (pause) No, it's still... it's the same as before. The lights are blinking but I'm not getting online.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) I'm actually not seeing the modem fully coming back online on my end either. That's... that's a bit unusual. Let me ask you something—have you had any recent storms, power outages, or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been clear all week.

Agent: Okay. Well, I have to be honest with you—it's looking like there might be an issue with the modem itself, or possibly a deeper issue with the line that I can't diagnose from here. Normally I'd have you try a few more troubleshooting steps, but this is looking like it might need an on-site visit from a technician.

Customer: Oh, come on. Really? How long would that take?

Agent: (pause) Let me check availability. (typing sounds, pause) I'm looking at our schedule right now for your area. We have availability... we could potentially get someone out there tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM, or we have a slot Thursday morning.

Customer: Tomorrow is... (pause) Yeah, tomorrow could work, I guess. But I really need this working. Is there nothing else we can try?

Agent: Well, let me try one more thing. Sometimes it's actually the ethernet cable from the modem to your computer or router. Can you try a different ethernet cable if you have one available?

Customer: Uh, I don't think I have a spare one just lying around. I mean, I have the one that came with it.

Agent: That might actually be the issue, to be honest. The cables can sometimes fail. But if you don't have another one to test with, there's not much we can do right now. Do you want to go ahead and schedule that technician visit for tomorrow?

Customer: (frustrated) Yeah, I guess I have to. But I'm going to need to take off work early or something.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry about that. We can schedule you for tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. The technician will be able to either repair the issue on-site or replace the modem if needed. You shouldn't have any charge for that visit given that we've done all the troubleshooting we can do remotely.

Customer: Okay, fine. Let's do it.

Agent: Perfect. Let me confirm that appointment for you. You're scheduled for tomorrow, [inaudible]... and we'll have a technician out at your address between noon and 4 PM. You'll get a courtesy call about an hour before they arrive. Is that number still 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's the right number.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation email as well. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I hope this gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I understand. I apologize for the inconvenience. Our technicians are really good and they'll get you sorted out. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Take care. Goodbye.
