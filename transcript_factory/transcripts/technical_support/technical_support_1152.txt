# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm really frustrated right now. I need to get this working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I definitely understand how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. Account holder is... Michael Torres?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you're experiencing no internet connectivity at all right now, is that correct?

Customer: Right. I woke up this morning and nothing. My router's lights are all... I mean, some are on, but nothing's working. I can't even get my laptop to connect.

Agent: Okay, let's troubleshoot this together. First thing I want to check—do you see any red lights on your modem or router? Any of those little indicator lights?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) The modem has the power light on, it's green. But I don't see the internet light... I think there's supposed to be one? It's not lit up.

Agent: That's actually a really helpful detail. The internet light not being on typically means we're not detecting a connection on our end. Before we go further, let me just check our systems here to see if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) What's your service address?

Customer: It's 4521 Oakmont Drive, apartment 2B.

Agent: (typing sounds) 4521 Oakmont, 2B... (pause) Okay, I'm not showing any active outages in that area right now, so that's good news and bad news, I guess. Let me walk you through some basic troubleshooting. Can you restart your modem for me?

Customer: Right now?

Agent: Yeah, if you could. Just unplug it from the power source, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Unplugging it now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged. (pause) Waiting... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: (pause) Good. While that's restarting, can you tell me... when did you last have internet working normally?

Customer: I'd say yesterday evening around seven or so? I was just browsing, everything was fine. This morning I tried to check my email and nothing.

Agent: Okay, so it was working last night. That helps. (pause) Do you see the modem lights coming back now?

Customer: Yeah, the green light's back. But... (pause) I don't think that internet light is coming on.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm going to need you to look at your router as well. Does your router have any lights on it?

Customer: The router? Um, yeah. It's got a couple lights, but I'm not really sure what they mean. Like, there's a blue light and... I don't know, some orange or amber color?

Agent: If the blue light is solid, that usually means it's powered on. The orange or amber light might indicate a connection issue. Let me ask you this—are you trying to connect wirelessly or with an ethernet cable?

Customer: Wireless. My laptop's trying to connect.

Agent: Okay. And when you look for available networks on your laptop, do you see your network name appearing?

Customer: (pause) Let me check... (typing sounds in background) No, actually I don't. I don't see it. That's weird.

Agent: Right, so it's not broadcasting. That might mean the router's not getting a signal from the modem. Let me have you do something for me. Can you check the cable connection between your modem and router?

Customer: The cable? Sure, I guess. (pause) Let me walk over there... (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it. It looks plugged in to me. It's in the port that says "internet" or whatever.

Agent: Good, good. And it looks secure? Like it's not loose or anything?

Customer: No, seems fine. Tight.

Agent: Alright. Let me try a few things on my end. I'm going to send a signal to your modem and see if I can get a response. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so... I'm not getting any response back. That tells me that either the modem isn't communicating with our network, or there's an issue with the line coming into your apartment.

Customer: What does that mean? Like, do I need a technician or something?

Agent: It might come to that, but let's exhaust our options first. One more thing I want to try—let me have you unplug the router as well and do a full reset of the entire system. Unplug the modem, unplug the router, wait a full minute this time, and then plug the modem in first and wait for it to fully boot up before you plug the router back in.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Unplugging now. (pause) Both of them. (pause) And I'm waiting. (pause) How long did you say?

Agent: A full minute.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been a minute. Plugging the modem back in now. (pause) The green light just came on. Now... waiting for it to fully boot. (typing sounds in background) Okay, I think it's stable. Now plugging the router back in.

Agent: Great. Now, give it about thirty seconds and then check your laptop again for available networks.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking... (pause) I... I still don't see it. That's not good, right?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, it's not. What I'm seeing here is that the modem is still not establishing a connection with our network. Have you experienced any weather recently? Any storms or anything like that?

Customer: Weather? No, it's been clear all week. Why?

Agent: Sometimes an external line can get damaged during storms, and I wanted to rule that out. (pause) Okay, so where we're at now is the modem isn't connecting to our network, which is unusual. Typically that points to either a hardware issue with the modem itself or a problem with the line coming into your building.

Customer: So what are you saying? Is there anything else we can try?

Agent: Well, let me check one more thing. (typing sounds) I want to see if there's any history of issues on your line. (pause) (typing sounds) Interesting. I'm not seeing anything that jumps out, but I am noticing your account has been active for... about two years now?

Customer: Yeah, about that. And this is the first time it's gone out.

Agent: Right. That's actually a good sign in terms of the line, but it does make me think this might be a device-specific issue. I have to be honest with you, Michael—we could try a few more things, but I'm fairly confident at this point that either the modem needs to be replaced or there's a physical issue with the line that requires a technician to investigate. Those are really your two options.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... what do you recommend?

Agent: I would recommend scheduling a technician visit. They can come out, test the line, and if it's the modem, we can replace it on the spot. If it's something with the line, they'll identify it and get it fixed. Typically our technicians can be out within one to three business days depending on your area.

Customer: One to three days? I need internet before that. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand, and I wish I could get you up and running right now. What I can do is get you on the schedule as soon as possible. Is tomorrow too far out?

Customer: Tomorrow would be... I mean, I guess I could make it work tomorrow if that's an option.

Agent: Let me check availability. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, tomorrow we have a window between 8 AM and 12 PM, or between 1 PM and 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: The afternoon slot. 1 to 5.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, Michael, I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, [inaudible] between 1 and 5 PM. You'll get a confirmation text and email shortly. The technician will bring a replacement modem if that's what ends up being the issue.

Customer: Okay. So... is there anything I should do in the meantime? Anything else I can try?

Agent: At this point, I think you've done everything we can troubleshoot remotely. Just keep the modem and router plugged in so the technician can see the current state of things when they arrive. And make sure someone's home to let them in.

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved today, but I'm confident the technician will have you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
