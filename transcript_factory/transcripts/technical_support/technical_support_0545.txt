# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without service for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, and what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got you here. I see you've got our Frontier Fiber 500 plan. Let me just... okay, so I'm showing that we don't have any outages reported in your area at the moment. Let's try to troubleshoot this together. First things first—can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the router powered on?

Customer: Yeah, the router's on. I can see the light is... well, it's blinking red. It's been doing that all morning.

Agent: Okay, the red blinking light—that typically indicates no internet connection coming into the device. That's actually helpful information. Have you tried unplugging the modem and router yet?

Customer: No, not yet. I didn't really know what to do. I'm not super tech-savvy, so I was just gonna call you guys.

Agent: No problem at all, that's what we're here for. Do you have a couple of minutes to try a quick reset with me?

Customer: Yeah, sure, go ahead.

Agent: Great. So what I want you to do is unplug the modem first—that's the box that your router connects to. It should have cables running into it from the wall.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I see it. There's like three cables going into it.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and unplug it from the power outlet. Just give it about thirty seconds while it's unplugged.

Customer: (background noise) Okay... unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. (pause) While we're waiting, James, have there been any recent storms in your area, or did anything unusual happen before the internet stopped working?

Customer: No storms or anything. I mean, there was some construction going on down the street yesterday, but that was... I don't know, that shouldn't affect my internet, right?

Agent: It's possible, actually. Construction can sometimes damage lines underground, but we would typically see an outage notification if that were the case. Alright, has it been about thirty seconds?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. Should I plug it back in now?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug the modem back in. You should see some lights come on, and they'll probably flash for about thirty to forty-five seconds while it reboots.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's back in. I see some lights now... they're flashing.

Agent: Good, that's normal. While that's booting back up, can you do the same thing with the router? Unplug it and wait about thirty seconds.

Customer: (background noise) Okay... got it unplugged. (pause) Alright, plugging the router back in now.

Agent: Perfect. Now while those are both rebooting, let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a line test to see if we're getting signal to your location.

Customer: (pause) How long does this usually take?

Agent: The router should fully boot in about two to three minutes. The line test on my end will just take a minute or so. (pause) Okay, James, I'm looking at the line test results here, and... hmm. That's interesting. I'm not showing a strong signal on the line. That could indicate an issue with either the connection from our equipment to your home, or possibly with the modem itself.

Customer: What does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: Well, let's see how the router performs first. Is it fully lit up now, or are there still lights blinking?

Customer: (pause) Um, the blue light came on, but it's blinking again. It's not solid blue like it usually is.

Agent: Okay, so it's still searching for a connection. The fact that we're not seeing a strong signal on my end is a bit concerning. Let me ask you—how long have you had your modem? Has it been a while?

Customer: I don't know, maybe... two years? Maybe longer? I'm not sure.

Agent: Okay. I don't think it's the modem age in this case, but the weak signal is definitely the issue. Let me try something else. Can you check the back of your modem and see if there's a cable that looks different? It might be thicker or have different connectors than the others.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's one that... it looks a little looser than the others, maybe?

Agent: Go ahead and try tightening that one up for me. Just hand-tighten it.

Customer: (background noise) Okay... (pause) ...got it tighter. (pause) Still blinking though.

Agent: Alright, let me check the line again. (typing sounds) (pause) Unfortunately, James, I'm still not seeing that signal improve. At this point, what I'm thinking is that there might be a problem with the connection from the street to your home. It's either a damaged line or a bad connection at the terminal outside.

Customer: So what do I do? Can you guys fix it?

Agent: [inaudible] ...definitely fix it, but it would require a technician to come out to your location. Given what I'm seeing, I don't think this is something we can resolve over the phone unfortunately. Let me check our availability...

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back. I work from home sometimes and...

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest I have available in your area is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? I mean... yeah, I guess that'll have to work. Is there anything else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: Honestly, with the signal being that weak, I don't think there's much more troubleshooting that would help at this point. The issue is definitely on our end—either the line or the terminal connection. But if you want to leave everything powered on, sometimes these things can resolve themselves, though I wouldn't count on it in this case.

Customer: Okay... alright.

Agent: Let me get you scheduled for that appointment. I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all the details. A technician will come to the address we have on file. Is 3456 Maple Drive still correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And James, I'm going to add a note here that the signal is very weak coming into your location, so the tech will be prepared for a potential line issue. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sure they will. Fiber is usually pretty reliable. This is just one of those unfortunate situations. Your confirmation number is 447829. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for trying.

Agent: You're welcome, James. We appreciate your patience. Have a good rest of your day, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
