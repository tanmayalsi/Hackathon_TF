Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's, uh, 555-0147. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here. And can I get your name please?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. So you're saying your internet is completely down? Do you have any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, yeah, so the modem—I'm looking at it right now—the lights are on but they're kind of... weird. Like, usually there's a green light but now it's just red and it's not doing anything.

Agent: Okay, that red light typically indicates a connection issue. Let me walk you through a few things. First, can you tell me where your modem is located?

Customer: It's in my living room, right by the TV.

Agent: Great. And it's connected to the wall outlet, correct?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, it's plugged in.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, what I'd like you to do is unplug the modem from the power source. Just go ahead and do that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. Done.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about thirty seconds before we plug it back in. That'll allow it to fully reset.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, it's been thirty seconds.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (sound of plugging in device) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) Hmm, the lights are doing the same thing. Still just red.

Agent: Still red? Okay. Let me check a few things on our end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me if you see any cable connections on the back of the modem that might be loose?

Customer: Oh, let me look. (pause) There's a couple cables back there. One's going to the wall and then... there's another one that goes to my router. Um, they both look pretty tight to me.

Agent: Alright, that's good. And just to confirm, you don't have any dial tone on your home phone either, correct? Because you'd be using the same line.

Customer: Oh, actually I didn't even think to check that. Um... (pause) No, you're right. No dial tone.

Agent: Okay, so it's definitely a line issue then. Let me pull up your service address here. You're on... Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, 412 Maple Street, Apartment 3C.

Agent: Got it. And have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. Everything was working fine yesterday.

Agent: I'm going to check our outage map here real quick. (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area at the moment, so that's... hmm. Let me ask you a few more things. Have there been any storms recently or any weather in your area?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear actually. Kind of a nice day out.

Agent: Alright. (typing sounds) And when exactly did you notice the internet went down?

Customer: This morning around 8 AM, I guess? I went to check my email and nothing was loading. I tried turning everything off and on again but it didn't help.

Agent: You did the right thing trying that. Okay, um... (pause) Let me see here. I'm going to check something. Can you look at your modem again and tell me if there's a button on the top or the front that might say "reset"?

Customer: Uh, yeah there is. There's a little button here that says "reset" but I'm a little hesitant to press that. Isn't that like... a factory reset?

Agent: No, no, don't worry. Just a regular power reset should do it. Don't press the reset button itself. Let me have you try something else. Can you unplug the modem again and also unplug your router?

Customer: Both of them?

Agent: Yes, both. Let's do a full reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Both are unplugged.

Agent: Good. Leave them unplugged for about a minute this time. Maybe a full minute.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, it's been like a minute and a half now. Plugging the modem back in first.

Agent: Yes, the modem first. Then wait about thirty seconds and plug in the router.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay, modem's in. (pause) And now the router. (sound of plugging in) Okay, both are in now.

Agent: Let's give them about two minutes to fully boot up and establish a connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it now. The lights are... still red. This doesn't look right.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Um, I'm going to be honest with you, James. This is looking like it might be an issue on the line side rather than with your equipment. Have you noticed any physical damage to the cable that comes into your apartment? Like, is it coming through the wall or...?

Customer: Uh, I'm not really sure where it comes in. I'd have to look around the apartment more carefully.

Agent: Yeah, if you could take a quick look, that would help. Like, is there a cable box or anything near an outside wall?

Customer: (pause) Let me walk around here... I'm not really seeing anything obvious. I mean, there's the main panel outside the building but I can't really get to that.

Agent: Right, yeah. Okay, so I've done what I can troubleshoot remotely here. (typing sounds) What I'm thinking at this point is that there might be an issue with the line coming to your address, and that's something we'd need to send a technician out to look at.

Customer: Oh man, really? How long would that take?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (pause) [inaudible] ...give me just one second here... Okay, looks like we have an opening tomorrow between 1 and 3 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't you get someone out today?

Agent: Unfortunately, today is pretty booked up. But we can definitely get someone out tomorrow. They'll be able to check the line and the connection point and diagnose exactly what's going on.

Customer: (sighs) I guess that's better than nothing. Yeah, tomorrow afternoon works.

Agent: Great. Let me just confirm some information for the appointment. The address is 412 Maple Street, Apartment 3C, and the best number to reach you at is the 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And I'll go ahead and make a note here that you're experiencing no internet and no phone service. The technician will be fully prepared when they arrive.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: (pause) Um, you can try the unplug and reset one more time if you'd like, but I have a feeling this is going to require a physical inspection. Just keep an eye on the modem and if anything changes, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Alright, will do. So tomorrow between 1 and 3 then?

Agent: That's correct. And you should receive a confirmation email or text at some point today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... really hope they can fix it tomorrow because I need the internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. I apologize for the inconvenience. Our technician will get this sorted out for you. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thank you, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your patience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
