Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without connection all day. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I see you're on our Frontier Fiber 500 plan. When exactly did you notice the internet go down?

Customer: Uh, around 8 this morning? I was working from home and everything just... stopped. The router's still on, all the lights are doing their normal thing, but nothing's actually connecting.

Agent: Okay, and just to confirm—you're not able to connect on any devices? We're talking phone, laptop, anything wireless?

Customer: Right, nothing. I tried my phone, my laptop, even my smart TV. Nothing connects. It's definitely the internet.

Agent: Got it. Well, let's try a few things here. First thing I'd like you to do is unplug your modem and router. Just pull out the power cables.

Customer: (pause) Okay, doing that now... alright, they're unplugged.

Agent: Great. Leave those unplugged for about 30 seconds. While we're waiting, have you noticed any outages in your area? Any storms last night or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine. Actually, I did notice there were some Frontier trucks in the neighborhood yesterday doing some work on the lines, but I figured that was routine maintenance.

Agent: Ah, okay. That could definitely be relevant. (typing sounds) Let me check if there's any maintenance work scheduled in your area... (pause) I'm not seeing anything currently active, but sometimes it takes a bit to update in the system. Go ahead and plug your modem back in now.

Customer: Okay... (pause) The modem's booting up. The lights are coming back... power's on, internet light is... oh. It's red. Is that bad?

Agent: The red light actually means it's not getting a signal from our network. That's interesting. Let me just verify something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a line test to see if we're detecting any connection issues from this location.

Customer: How long does that take?

Agent: Just a moment... (pause) Okay, so the test is showing that we're not detecting any active connection on the line either. That suggests the issue is actually on the infrastructure side, not with your equipment.

Customer: So like... you guys have a problem?

Agent: It appears that way, yes. Now, given that you mentioned the Frontier trucks yesterday, it's possible something happened during that maintenance. I'd like to schedule a technician to come out and inspect the line. They can check the connection point and make sure everything was properly reconnected. Does that work for you?

Customer: I mean... I don't really have a choice, do I? When can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check availability... (typing sounds) I can get someone out there tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we have another slot on Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning. I've already lost a whole day of work.

Agent: Understood. Before I lock that in, let me just try one more thing really quick. I want to make absolutely sure we've done all the basic troubleshooting. Can you check—is there a power outlet near your router?

Customer: Yeah, it's plugged in right next to where I'm sitting.

Agent: Okay, and is the power outlet working? Like, if you plug something else in there, does it power on?

Customer: (pause) Um, let me grab my phone charger... yeah, it works fine. The outlet's good.

Agent: Alright, just wanted to rule that out. And the cables going into the modem—they're both firmly connected? The one coming from the wall and the one to the router?

Customer: They look fine. They've been like this for months without any issues.

Agent: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so at this point I'm fairly confident the issue is external. Let me get that technician scheduled for you. That would be tomorrow, [inaudible] between 8 AM and noon. Can you confirm that works?

Customer: Yeah, tomorrow morning is fine. What do I need to do before they get there?

Agent: Just leave everything as it is, actually. Don't unplug anything else or try any other troubleshooting. We want the technician to see it in the same state so they can diagnose it properly. They'll have their own equipment to test the line.

Customer: Okay. Do I need to be home?

Agent: Yes, someone will need to be there to let them in and provide access to where your connection point is. It's usually outside the home, but they may need to access the interior sometimes too.

Customer: Alright, I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. So to recap, you have a service call scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. A technician will come inspect the line connection and determine why we're not seeing an active signal. Your confirmation number is 4829156. You can use that to reschedule if needed, or if you have questions before they arrive, reference that number when you call back.

Customer: Got it. 4829156. Um, will the internet be back on tomorrow after they leave?

Agent: (pause) That's the hope, yes. If it's a simple reconnection issue like we suspect, it should be pretty quick. However, if there's damage to the line itself, it might take a bit longer. The technician will be able to give you a better idea once they're out there.

Customer: Alright. I guess I just... I really needed this internet working today. I have deadlines.

Agent: I totally understand. I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved remotely. Hopefully the technician will have you back up and running first thing tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... that's all I guess. Thanks for your help.

Agent: Of course. And again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
