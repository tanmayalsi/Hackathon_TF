Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried unplugging everything and plugging it back in, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Uh, yeah, it's the one ending in 4827. That's my cell phone.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber service in the Scottsdale area. And you're saying the internet is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. I can't get anything. The router is on, the lights are blinking, but I'm not getting any connection to anything.

Agent: Okay, good. Let me ask you a few questions first. Are you seeing any lights on the front of your gateway right now?

Customer: Um, yeah. Let me look... There's a blue light and a green light, I think. They're both on but blinking.

Agent: Alright, and what about the red light? Is there a red light showing at all?

Customer: No, I don't see a red light. Just the blue and green ones blinking.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. And when you say they're blinking, are they blinking continuously or every few seconds?

Customer: (pause) Every few seconds, I'd say. Like, not constantly.

Agent: Perfect. That usually means the gateway is trying to connect. What I'd like you to do is unplug the gateway from the power source for about 30 seconds. Just pull the power cable out completely.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (background noise of movement) Yeah, I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. While that's unplugging, can I get your address just to verify I'm looking at the right account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 1447 North Hayden Road, Scottsdale.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got that. And how long has it been since you unplugged it?

Customer: Probably about 20 seconds now.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (background noise) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, so the lights are... they're doing the same thing. Still blinking.

Agent: Still blinking, okay. That's... let me check something on my end here. (pause) Are you able to see if there's maybe any physical damage to the cables coming into your home? Sometimes if there's been any work done in the area or weather, those can get damaged.

Customer: (pause) Uh, I'm not really... I mean, I'm inside. Where would I be looking exactly?

Agent: Oh, sure. If you go outside your house, there's usually a fiber line that runs to your home. It's a thin cable, maybe about the size of a pen. Does any of that look damaged or unplugged anywhere?

Customer: (background noise, door opening) Okay, I'm outside now. Let me look around here... Um, I see something that looks like that. It's coming around the corner of the house. It looks fine to me. It's plugged in where it goes in, I think.

Agent: Alright, good. That's connected properly then. Let me try something else. When you went back inside, did those lights change at all on the gateway?

Customer: No, they're still just blinking like before.

Agent: Okay, um... (pause) Let me put you on a brief hold while I check if there might be an outage in your area. Should only take a moment.

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: (hold music for approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, which is... which is actually a bit puzzling. The gateway seems to be in the right state, the lines look good from your end. Let me try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the gateway?

Customer: A factory reset? What does that involve?

Agent: There should be a small reset button on the back of the gateway. You'll need a paperclip or something thin. You hold that button down for about 10 to 15 seconds while it's powered on, and that'll reset it back to factory settings.

Customer: (pause) Oh man, okay. That's gonna reset everything though, right? Like my WiFi password and stuff?

Agent: Yes, it will reset everything. So you'd have to set it back up again after. But let's see if that helps get you reconnected first.

Customer: Alright, let me try that. (pause, background noise of searching) Okay, I found a paperclip. (pause) Holding down the button now. (pause) It's been... maybe 10 seconds. The lights are going crazy now. Like, they're all kind of flickering together.

Agent: That's actually normal. That means it's resetting. Go ahead and let go of the button now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let go. (pause) So now what? Do I wait?

Agent: Yeah, just wait about a minute and see if it comes back up. The lights should go through a cycle and then settle down.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, uh... so they've settled down to the same blinking pattern again. Same as before. That didn't help.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay. Well, that's... that's unusual. Let me see what else we can try. Can you tell me—have you had any power issues at your house? Or any storms recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine this morning, and then when I came home from work it was just... down.

Agent: I understand. (pause, typing sounds) So the gateway is functioning, it's trying to connect, but it's not able to complete the connection. That usually points to either an issue with the line coming into your home, or... (pause) [inaudible] ...or potentially an issue with the ONT unit outside.

Customer: What's an ONT? I thought it was the gateway thing.

Agent: Right, so the gateway is what you see inside. The ONT is the box that's outside where the fiber line connects to your home's infrastructure. It's separate from the gateway.

Customer: Oh, okay. So... is that something you can check from your end?

Agent: (pause) I can check some diagnostics, yes, but I'm not able to do a full remote reset on that without potentially rolling a truck out. Let me be honest with you—and I know this isn't what you want to hear—but I think at this point we might need to schedule a technician to come out and check both the ONT and the inside wiring.

Customer: Really? So you can't figure this out over the phone?

Agent: I wish I could. I've walked through the standard troubleshooting steps—the restart, the reset, the physical inspection—and the gateway is behaving like it wants to connect but can't. That usually means there's something physical going on that I can't diagnose from here. A technician would be able to check the ONT, the fiber line, and all the connections in person.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, I guess... when's the earliest you can get someone out here?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds, pause) For your area, I'm seeing... we can get someone out tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM, or if you prefer, Thursday morning between 8 and 12.

Customer: Tomorrow's better. Can I do that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. That'll be tomorrow, [inaudible] between noon and 4 PM. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive to let you know they're on the way. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we finish up?

Customer: No, I think that's... I mean, hopefully they can fix it. This is pretty inconvenient.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get this sorted out for you tomorrow. Your confirmation number is going to be sent to the phone number on file. You've got that?

Customer: Yeah, I got it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow!

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
