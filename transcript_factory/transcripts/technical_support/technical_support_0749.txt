# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've tried restarting the router and nothing's working.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing) Okay, I've got you here. And just to confirm, is this for the address on 42 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying the internet is completely down? Do you have any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, let me look. The modem has... there's a red light on the front. The router's... I think it's blinking orange.

Agent: Okay, so the red light typically means there's no connection coming in from our line. And the orange blinking on the router usually means it's trying to sync but can't connect to the modem. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Yep, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now while that's unplugging, let me also ask—have you had any recent storms in your area? Any weather events in the last day or so?

Customer: Uh, not really. It was pretty clear this morning. Although, I guess there was a little wind last night. Nothing major though.

Agent: Mm-hmm. Okay, so just give the modem about thirty seconds unplugged. Let's let it completely power down. (pause) You still there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, I'm waiting for the lights to come back on.

Agent: Yeah, it should take about a minute or so to fully boot back up. What lights are you seeing now?

Customer: Still red on the modem. The router is... it's still blinking orange, actually.

Agent: (pause) Okay. So the red light is persisting. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) I'm going to see if there are any service outages in your area. Can you hold on for just one moment?

Customer: Sure, yeah, that's fine.

Agent: (brief hold music) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I'm not seeing any active outages reported in your zip code. Let me ask you a couple more questions. Is the modem plugged directly into the wall outlet, or is it plugged into a power strip?

Customer: It's on a power strip, actually. Should it not be?

Agent: It's not ideal, but it shouldn't be causing an issue necessarily. Let me have you try something else. Can you check the cables for me? The one that comes from the wall—that's your fiber line—can you make sure it's securely connected to the back of the modem?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the back here. Um, there's a lot of cables. Which one is it?

Agent: It should be the one that kind of looks like a thin cord, and it might have a little orange or yellow tip on it. Does that ring a bell?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I see it. It looks pretty connected to me. It's pretty snug.

Agent: Okay, what I want you to do is disconnect it—just pull it out gently—and then plug it back in. Make sure you hear it click.

Customer: (pause) Okay... pulling it out... and... plugging it back in. (pause) Yeah, I heard it click.

Agent: Good, good. Now let's give it another minute to resync. (pause) What are we looking at now on the lights?

Customer: (pause) Still the same. Red light on the modem. The router's still orange.

Agent: (sigh) Okay. Um, let me try one more thing with you. I'm going to have you do a full reset on the modem. There should be a small button on the back—it might be recessed—that says "Reset." Do you see that?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. Do I... do I press it?

Agent: Yes, but I want you to hold it down for about ten seconds. It's going to turn off all the lights, and then it'll restart. Go ahead and try that for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it down. (pause) All the lights turned off. Now I'm just waiting for it to come back on?

Agent: Exactly. Just give it a minute or so.

Customer: (pause, longer silence) Okay, the modem's back on. But... it's still showing red.

Agent: (pause) Still red?

Customer: Yeah. And the router's the same as before too.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm going to be honest with you. The fact that the modem isn't getting that initial connection from the line, and it's not coming back even after the reset, that suggests there might be an issue on our infrastructure side or possibly with the modem itself.

Customer: Oh, man. So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, I have a couple of options for you. One would be to schedule a technician to come out and take a look at things—either the line coming into your home or potentially replace the modem. Or, if you have access to another device we could try, we could rule out that the modem is definitely the problem.

Customer: (pause) Uh, I don't really have another modem lying around, no. How long would it take to get a technician out here?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) I'm showing we could get someone out there... looks like tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have availability on Thursday afternoon after 2 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. Let me do that.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to schedule that for you tomorrow between 8 and 12. Let me just confirm your contact number one more time—is that 555-0147?

Customer: Yep, that's right.

Agent: Okay, you should get a text message confirmation within the next few minutes. The technician might call you thirty minutes before they arrive to let you know they're on the way.

Customer: Okay, got it. And... is there anything I should try in the meantime? Just to see if it comes back online on its own?

Agent: (pause) You could try the unplugging the modem again before you go to bed tonight, just in case. But honestly, with that persistent red light, I don't think it's going to resolve on its own. The technician will definitely get to the bottom of it for you.

Customer: Alright. Well, I appreciate your help, Derek. I guess I'll just wait for tomorrow then.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved for you today, but our tech will definitely take care of you tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your patience. Have a good night.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
