Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got work I need to do, so I'm hoping you guys can fix this quick.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's the number you just called from.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got it right here. So you're showing service at 4847 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Okay, great. And you said your internet went out about an hour ago?

Customer: Yeah, around one o'clock. I was working from home and everything just stopped. The modem lights are doing... I don't know, they're kind of flickering, I guess?

Agent: Alright, so the modem is on and powering up. That's a good sign. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Do you have a modem and router set up, or are you using a combo unit?

Customer: Uh, it's just one box. I think that's both? It's the white one you guys gave me.

Agent: That's the combo unit, perfect. Okay, so I'm looking at your account and I'm not seeing any outages in your area currently, so let's do some basic troubleshooting. Can you tell me what color lights you're seeing on the modem right now?

Customer: Um, let me look at it. (pause) There's a green light and then a red light that keeps blinking on and off.

Agent: Okay, so the green light is good—that means it's powered on. But the red blinking light typically indicates a connection issue. Let's try the first thing, which is usually the easiest fix. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cord out.

Customer: Yeah, give me one second. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds. Just... let it sit there.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been like thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) (background noise of plugging in cord) Okay, it's plugged back in now.

Agent: Excellent. What we call that is a power cycle, and it basically resets the connection. Let's wait for it to fully boot back up. That usually takes about two to three minutes. While we're waiting, let me ask—have you made any changes to your setup recently? New equipment, moved anything around?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine all morning. I was watching YouTube before it happened and then... nothing.

Agent: Okay, that helps. (pause) So the modem should be coming back online. Are you seeing any changes in the lights now?

Customer: The green light came back on, but... the red light is still blinking. It's not as fast, but it's still doing it.

Agent: Hmm, alright. The red light should actually go away once it fully connects. Let's give it another minute or so. (pause) Still blinking?

Customer: Yeah, still there.

Agent: Okay, let me try the next step. Can you check the cable that goes into the modem? The coax cable? It should be a silver-tipped cable, probably on the back of the modem.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. Do you want me to unplug it?

Agent: Actually, before we do that, can you just visually check it? Make sure it's not loose or damaged or anything like that?

Customer: (pause) It looks... I mean, it looks fine to me. It's connected pretty tight.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and unplug it anyway and then plug it back in. Sometimes these connections can work themselves loose over time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugged it. (pause) Plugging it back in. (pause) It's in.

Agent: Good. Let's see if that helps. What are the lights doing now?

Customer: (pause) Same thing. Red light still blinking.

Agent: Okay, let me check something on my end real quick. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm going to check if we're even receiving a signal from your modem here. Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Sure, take your time.

Agent: (longer pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so here's what I'm seeing. Your modem is actually sending out a signal, but I'm not getting a strong response back from it. That usually means either there's a line issue or there might be a problem with the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, let me try one more thing first. Let me send a reboot command to your modem from our end. That's a little different from unplugging it. Sometimes that can resolve these kinds of connection issues. Can you watch the modem while I do this?

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent: (typing sounds) And... sending it now. (pause) You should see the lights restart.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the lights went off for a second and now they're coming back on. Green light is back... and there's the red light again.

Agent: (sigh) Okay, so that didn't resolve it. Let me be honest with you—if the lights aren't stabilizing after these troubleshooting steps, it's usually pointing to either a hardware issue with the modem itself or a problem with the line coming into your home.

Customer: So what, you need to send a technician out or something?

Agent: That would be the next step, yes. But before we schedule that, let me ask—do you have any other devices that might have ethernet cables plugged into the modem? Like a computer or a TV box?

Customer: Um, I've got my laptop that I usually have connected, but I unplugged it when the internet went out.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. (pause) Let me try one more diagnostic here. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I'm running a line test... (longer pause) (typing sounds) 

Hmm, I'm not getting a clean response on the line. That would suggest that the issue might be on our end—either the line to your house or possibly at the junction point.

Customer: But you can still fix it though, right? I mean, I'm paying for this service.

Agent: Absolutely, and I understand your frustration. What I need to do is get a technician scheduled to come out and diagnose this properly. They'll be able to check the line, the connection, and if necessary, replace the modem. Unfortunately, I'm not able to fully resolve this over the phone.

Customer: When can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check availability. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest I can get you is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? I really needed this fixed today...

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize. Unfortunately, all our technicians are booked this afternoon. Tomorrow morning is the earliest availability. I can also check if there's a late afternoon slot that might open up...

Customer: No, no, tomorrow morning is fine. That's... I guess I can make that work.

Agent: Great. So I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. Can you make sure someone is home to let them in?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. You'll get a confirmation email at the address on file, and you should also get a text alert about an hour before the technician arrives so you know approximately when to expect them. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just... I wish this could've been resolved today.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry we couldn't get it working remotely. But our technician will absolutely get you taken care of tomorrow. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
