Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Thanks. Alright, I've got your account here. I can see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. When did you first notice the internet wasn't working?

Customer: Like, around 7 this morning. I tried to check my email and nothing was loading. At first I thought maybe it was just slow, but then I realized nothing was connecting at all.

Agent: Okay, and have you tried doing a restart on your equipment yet?

Customer: No, not yet. I wasn't sure if that would help, honestly.

Agent: Yeah, that's actually a great first step. Why don't we try that? Can you go ahead and unplug your modem and router? It's the equipment you have from us—usually in a box or mounted on a wall.

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, I see it. It's right here by my desk. So I just pull the power cord?

Agent: Exactly. Just unplug the power cord from the back of both devices. We'll let them sit for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, they're unplugged. Should I wait like you said?

Agent: Yep, just count to thirty. Go ahead and do that now.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Great. Now go ahead and plug the modem back in first—that's the device that connects to the wall outlet where your internet comes in. Wait about a minute for that to fully boot up, then plug the router back in.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, modem's back in. I'm waiting... (another pause) Alright, router's back in too.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it another minute or so to fully initialize. While we're waiting, can you tell me if you've had any recent storms or any unusual activity with your service before today?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been pretty clear. And it was working fine last night when I was doing some work.

Agent: Good to know. Okay, let's check on those devices now. Are you seeing any lights on the front of the modem and router? Usually they should have some green or blue lights.

Customer: (pause) Um, the modem has a couple lights on, yeah. They're green. But the router... the router lights aren't coming on. That's weird, right?

Agent: Hmm, okay. The modem's a good sign. Can you check the power cable on the router? Make sure it's plugged in firmly? Sometimes those connections can come loose.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Let me see... (pause) Oh, huh. It's pretty loose actually. I'm pushing it in... there. Did that.

Agent: Okay, good. Give it just a minute and see if those lights come on.

Customer: (waiting) I'm still not seeing anything. Like, nothing's happening.

Agent: Alright, let me try something else. Can you unplug the router again and wait about thirty seconds?

Customer: Sure. (unplugging sound) Okay, waiting... (long pause) Alright.

Agent: Now plug it back in.

Customer: (plugging sound) Plugging it back in now. (pause) Still nothing. The lights aren't coming on at all.

Agent: Okay, that's unusual. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) David, I'm not seeing an active connection from your router to our network right now. It's possible the device itself is having an issue. Before we go down that road though, let me ask—is there maybe a reset button on the router? Sometimes it gets pressed accidentally.

Customer: A reset button? Um... (pause) I see a button that says "Reset" but it's kind of recessed. Like you'd need something to press it.

Agent: Okay, hold off on that for now. That would reset everything and we'd need to reconfigure it anyway. Let me try another approach. Can you check the cable that runs from the modem to the router? Make sure that's connected on both ends?

Customer: Oh, you mean like the ethernet cable?

Agent: Yes, exactly.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Let me check. Um, yeah, it looks like it's plugged in on both sides to me. It looks fine.

Agent: Okay. And you're not seeing any lights on the router still?

Customer: No, nothing. It's like it's completely dead.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm going to be honest with you here. It sounds like the router might be experiencing a hardware failure. That's frustrating. But let me try one more thing before we replace it. Can you try using a different power adapter if you have one around? Sometimes the power supply goes bad.

Customer: I don't think I have anything that would fit. Do you have any other ideas?

Agent: (pause with typing sounds) Well, let me see if there's anything else I can troubleshoot. Can you tell me if the modem itself is connecting to the internet? Sometimes you can check this by opening a web browser if you have a phone or another device... oh, wait. I guess you don't have internet right now. That's the whole problem. (slight laugh)

Customer: (chuckles) Yeah, yeah, that's not going to work.

Agent: Right, right. I'm sorry. Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. The modem appears to be working, which is good news. But the router isn't powering on at all, which suggests it's a power supply issue or possibly the device itself. We can definitely send you a replacement router. However, there is one more thing we could try—do you have any other cables or power adapters around the house that might work?

Customer: I don't think... well, I mean, I don't even know what size it needs to be. 

Agent: That's fair. Yeah, without knowing the specs, that could actually damage it. Let me just go ahead and get you set up with a replacement router. I can have that shipped out to you today, and it should arrive within three to five business days.

Customer: (disappointed) Three to five days? I mean, I need internet before then. Is there any way to get it faster?

Agent: I understand, and I wish I could expedite it further. We do have an express shipping option, but that's not available on equipment replacements, unfortunately. However, once you receive the router, the setup is pretty straightforward. We can even do a callback to walk you through it.

Customer: So there's really nothing you can do? I can't get online today at all?

Agent: (pause) Well, let me look into this one more time. (typing sounds) David, I'm looking at your account, and I don't show any service outages in your area. The modem is online, which means your internet connection itself is active. The issue is really just with the router hardware. If you had a mobile hotspot or a neighbor's WiFi you could borrow temporarily, that would get you by until the replacement arrives.

Customer: Yeah, I mean, maybe I could go sit at a coffee shop or something, but that's not ideal.

Agent: I completely understand. That's frustrating. Unfortunately, without a working router, we can't get you WiFi capability at home. And if your modem is the older model without built-in WiFi, then we're stuck until we get you a replacement unit.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, so what's the process? How long until I get the new router?

Agent: So I'll get that shipped out to you today. As I mentioned, it should arrive in three to five business days. Once it arrives, you'll just need to unplug your current router, connect the new one using the same cables, and power it on. The lights should come right up, and it should automatically connect to our network. Like I said, I can call you back or you can call us if you need any help setting it up.

Customer: Alright. Yeah, that works, I guess. Can you at least send it faster?

Agent: Let me check what we have available. (pause) Unfortunately, we don't have expedited shipping for equipment right now. I apologize for that. But if you want to check back in a couple days and it's already arrived, that's possible too.

Customer: Great. Well, I mean, not great, but... you know. Can you at least tell me when to expect it? What days are we talking about?

Agent: Let me get that for you. (typing) Okay, so I'm processing this for shipment today. Standard delivery would put it arriving between [inaudible]—hold on—that would be between the 19th and the 23rd of this month. You'll get a tracking number via email once it ships.

Customer: Okay, the 19th to the 23rd. Got it.

Agent: Yes. And again, once you get it, just reach out if you need help. We're here.

Customer: Yeah, will do. Thanks, I guess. I'm just frustrated about losing internet for that long, but I understand it's not your fault.

Agent: I really do appreciate your patience, David. I know this is inconvenient. We'll get you back up and running as soon as possible.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll talk soon.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
