Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I need to get this fixed pretty quickly.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. One moment... Alright, I've got you here. So your internet service is completely down? Are you seeing any lights on your modem right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) Let me look at it. It's over here by the router. So, I've got... the power light is on, it's green, but the internet light—I think it's supposed to be blue or something—that one's off. It's not lit up.

Agent: Okay, good. That actually tells me quite a bit. So the modem's getting power, which is the first thing we want to see. That light you're talking about, yeah, that should be solid blue or maybe blinking blue when it's connecting. The fact that it's dark suggests we're not establishing a connection to our network. Let me ask you a few questions. Have you had any changes to your setup recently? Like, did you move anything or install anything new?

Customer: No, no, nothing like that. It was working fine last night, and then I woke up this morning and just... nothing.

Agent: Alright. And have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in yet?

Customer: Oh, um, not yet. Do you want me to do that now?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Go ahead and unplug the power cable from the modem for about thirty seconds. While you're doing that, I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: (background noise of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged. Should I wait thirty seconds?

Agent: Yep, just give it about thirty seconds. That'll let the modem do a full restart.

Customer: (pause) Alright, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (background noise) Plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Great. Now, let's give it about a minute to boot back up. Those lights should start cycling through and then settle into what they're supposed to be.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... the power light came back on, it's green again, but the internet light is still... it's still not doing anything.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's not what we wanted to see. Let me try a couple other things. Can you check for me—is your modem plugged directly into the wall outlet, or is it plugged into a power strip?

Customer: Um, it's plugged into a power strip. Does that matter?

Agent: It can sometimes, yeah. Try unplugging it from the power strip and plugging it directly into a wall outlet instead. Sometimes power strips can cause issues, especially if there are a lot of devices on there.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, moving it over here. (pause) Alright, plugged it directly into the wall now.

Agent: Good. Let's do that full restart again. Go ahead and unplug it for thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Unplugging now. (pause) And... (pause) Okay, thirty seconds. (plugging sounds) Replugging it in.

Customer: (pause) Same thing. Power light's green, but the internet light is still off.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me if there's any kind of display screen on your modem? Like, is there text showing on the front of it?

Customer: Yeah, there's a little screen. It just says... "Connecting" and then it has a dot-dot-dot that keeps going.

Agent: Okay, so it's trying to establish connection. That's actually good—that means the modem is trying to communicate with our network. Let me look into your account here and see if there's anything on our end. (typing sounds) 

(pause)

Give me just one second here...

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (pause) I'm going to check your service status in your area. Is there anything in the background of your setup? Like, is there an outlet box or a modem near a window or anything like that?

Customer: Um, well, the modem is close to a window. Should I move it?

Agent: Let's try that, actually. Yeah, if there's any interference or if the connection to the line is being affected, moving it away from the window might help. Fiber lines can be sensitive sometimes.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, moving it to the other side of the room here. Let me unplug it and... (pause) ...replugging it in over here.

Customer: (pause) Still the same thing. It's trying to connect but it's not getting anywhere.

Agent: Alright, let me check the fiber connection itself. Can you look at the modem again and tell me if there's a port on the back that has like, a blue light or a little indicator next to it?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's... I see a port that has a little light next to it. It's like, an orange or red color?

Agent: Okay, so that's not what we want to see either. What we're looking at here is that the modem isn't getting a clean signal from our fiber line. This could mean a couple of things. It could be a problem with the connection outside your home, or it could be a problem with our network. 

Let me ask you—have you checked your email or your account online? Sometimes we send notifications about service outages in the area.

Customer: No, I haven't checked. Let me do that real quick. (pause) Okay, I'm on my phone now... checking my email. (pause) I don't see anything from Frontier about an outage.

Agent: Alright. So what I think we should do at this point is escalate this to our technical team. We're looking at either an issue with the line coming into your home, which would require a technician to come out and check, or possibly something on our network side that I can't diagnose from here. Before we do that though, let me try one more thing real quick.

Customer: Okay, yeah, whatever you think.

Agent: Can you locate the fiber connection coming into your home? There should be a small box, usually white or gray, somewhere on the outside of your house or maybe in a closet.

Customer: (background noise) Um, let me look around. I think there might be something in the garage. Hold on. (pause) Yeah, there's a small gray box. Is that it?

Agent: Probably, yeah. Can you check if there are any cables coming out of it, and are any of them loose or unplugged?

Customer: (pause) Let me get a closer look. (pause) No, they all look pretty secure to me. I don't see anything obviously wrong.

Agent: Okay, good. That's helpful information. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to send a technician out to your location. They'll be able to check the actual line connection and run some diagnostics that I can't do from here. Can you hold for just a moment while I get that set up for you?

Customer: Yeah, sure. How long is this going to take?

Agent: Just a couple of minutes. (pause) I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I pull up the scheduling system.

(hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Thanks for holding. Alright, so I've got a technician available tomorrow between 9 AM and 12 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Really? I kind of need this fixed today if possible.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see if there's anything earlier... (typing sounds) Unfortunately, today is fully booked for technician appointments in your area. But I can note on your account that this is urgent, and the technician tomorrow might be able to prioritize you first thing. Would the morning window work?

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, I guess that'll have to work. It's just... I need internet for work, you know?

Agent: I totally get it. I'm sorry we weren't able to get this resolved right now. The technician tomorrow should be able to figure out what's going on. In the meantime, if anything changes or if you notice the connection come back up, just give us a call back and we can cancel the appointment.

Customer: Alright, will do. So that's tomorrow between 9 and 12?

Agent: That's right. Tomorrow, 9 AM to 12 PM. I'm sending you a confirmation email with all the details, and there'll be a reference number. The technician will also try to call you about thirty minutes before they arrive. Your phone number on file is 555-0148, correct?

Customer: Yep, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm your address for the technician—that's 447 Maple Drive, apartment 3B?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's... I think that's everything. I'm just hoping they can figure it out tomorrow.

Agent: I'm hopeful they will too. We'll get you back online. Is there anything else I can help with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't resolve it remotely. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Alright, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
