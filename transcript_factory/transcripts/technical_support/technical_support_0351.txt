Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this still the best number to reach you at?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So, internet's completely down since this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing. Just nothing. The modem's sitting there on my desk and I don't even know... like, is it supposed to be lit up? Because I'm looking at it right now and I don't see anything.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. Let me ask you a few things. First, do you see any lights on the modem at all? Any red lights, green lights, anything?

Customer: (pause) No, nothing. It's completely dark.

Agent: Alright. Is the modem plugged in?

Customer: Of course it's plugged in. (slight laugh) I mean, yes, it's plugged in.

Agent: (chuckles) Hey, you'd be surprised how often that's the issue. Okay, so it's plugged in but there are no lights on it at all?

Customer: Correct. Nothing.

Agent: Alright, let me check your account here. (typing sounds) I'm going to look at what we're showing on our end... (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any outages in your area right now, which is good. But with the modem being completely dark, it sounds like it might be a power issue. Do you have another outlet you could try plugging it into? Just to rule that out?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I guess so. Let me... (pause) Okay, I'm unplugging it now. (pause) I'm moving it over to the outlet by my window.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged in... (longer pause) Still nothing. Still completely dark.

Agent: Hmm, that's... that's unfortunate. Let me ask you this—do you have the power cable that came with the modem, or is it a different cable?

Customer: I don't know, it's just... it's the cable that's been there. I've had this modem for like three years, maybe longer.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. Um, this might sound odd, but is the power brick warm at all? If you can touch it safely?

Customer: (pause) No, it's cold. Completely cold.

Agent: Yeah, so that tells me the power brick probably isn't getting any power. The good news is we can get you a replacement modem shipped out. The not-so-good news is we're looking at about five to seven business days for shipping.

Customer: Five to seven days? Are you kidding me? I need internet now. I work from home. This is... I can't be without internet for a week.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm really sorry about that. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I'm looking at our options. We do have expedited shipping available for an additional fee, which would get it to you in two to three business days.

Customer: How much is the additional fee?

Agent: That would be $29.99 for expedited shipping.

Customer: (pause) That's... that's pretty steep. Is there any other option? Like, can I pick it up somewhere or...?

Agent: Unfortunately, we don't have local pickup available in your area. But I'll tell you what—let me try one more thing before we go down this route. Sometimes these older power bricks can just need a hard reset. Do you have a surge protector or power strip nearby?

Customer: Uh, yeah, it's plugged into one right now, actually.

Agent: Perfect. Can you unplug the modem from the surge protector, and then unplug the surge protector from the wall outlet? We're going to let it sit for about a minute.

Customer: Okay... (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just give it about 60 seconds. (pause) How's work been treating you, by the way?

Customer: (slight laugh) Uh, it's... it's been fine, but I'm gonna be less fine if I don't get internet. (pause) Okay, it's been a minute.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug the surge protector back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) Nope. Still nothing. This isn't working.

Agent: (sighs) Yeah, I was hoping that would do it. Okay, so... I'm fairly confident at this point that it's the modem itself. The power brick isn't functioning. I don't want to waste your time with more troubleshooting when I'm pretty sure we're looking at a hardware failure.

Customer: So what do I do?

Agent: So here's what I can do for you. I can waive the expedited shipping fee this time as a courtesy. That would get you a replacement modem in two to three business days at no additional cost.

Customer: (pause) I mean... okay, I guess that's better than a week. When would it arrive?

Agent: (typing) Based on when we process this, if we get it submitted today, you're looking at delivery by... Thursday or Friday of next week.

Customer: (sighs) That's still several days without internet.

Agent: I know, and I really am sorry about this. If you need to get online in the meantime, do you have a mobile hotspot plan, or a local coffee shop or library you could use?

Customer: (pause) I guess I could use my phone's hotspot, but that's only good for so much data. And I have meetings, I need reliable internet.

Agent: Yeah, I hear you. Unfortunately, there's not a lot we can do on the immediate end if the modem's completely failed. But here's what I'm going to do—I'm going to go ahead and get this replacement ordered for you right now with the expedited shipping waived. I'm also going to add a $10 credit to your account for the inconvenience and the downtime you're experiencing.

Customer: (pause) Well, that's... that's something, I guess. Okay, yeah, do that.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just confirm your shipping address real quick. (typing) I'm showing that as 447 Maple Drive, apartment 3B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And you should receive a tracking number via email within the next couple hours. Is the email on file still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Excellent. So the modem should arrive by Friday. Once you receive it, installation is pretty straightforward. The instructions are in the box, but if you run into any issues, you can just call us back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Okay. And how long does that usually take to set up?

Agent: Usually just about 10 to 15 minutes. Just plug in the power, plug in the ethernet cable from the wall outlet, and wait for it to boot up. Pretty simple stuff.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: Nope, that should be it. You're all set. Again, I'm really sorry about the inconvenience here. We'll get you back online as soon as we can.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Thanks for trying, I guess. I appreciate the credit at least.

Agent: Of course. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see you back online soon. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
