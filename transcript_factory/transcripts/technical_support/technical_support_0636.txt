Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got some work stuff I need to do from home.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. And your name is Michael Thompson?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. So your internet service went down this morning. Have you noticed anything else unusual, or is it just the internet?

Customer: Just the internet. Everything else seems fine. The TV's working, phone's working fine. It's just the internet that's completely out.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Can you tell me what you've already tried to fix it?

Customer: Um, well, I unplugged the router and waited like... I don't know, thirty seconds? Then plugged it back in. And I tried restarting my computer too, but nothing's worked.

Agent: Good, good. Those are the right first steps. Let me walk you through a few more things. First, can you look at your modem? That's the device that came from us—usually a white or gray box. Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. Um... the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light... I think it's red? Or orange maybe?

Agent: Okay, so that red or orange light is telling us there's an issue with the connection. That's actually really helpful information. And are there any other lights lit up?

Customer: There's like a blinking light... I think that might be the WiFi light? That one's blinking.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something. I'm going to have you do a full reset of the modem. Can you locate the reset button on the back? It's usually a small button that's kind of recessed.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause) I think I found it. There's a little hole with a button inside it, is that it?

Agent: That's exactly it. What I need you to do is use a paperclip or something thin and press and hold that button for about ten seconds. It's going to restart the modem completely.

Customer: Okay, I'm doing it now. (pause) Okay, I held it down. Everything went dark for a second and now it's coming back on.

Agent: Perfect. Now just give it a couple minutes to fully boot back up. While we're waiting, have you had any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: Not that I know of. It was fine last night. I didn't notice anything this morning, but I guess I wasn't really paying attention.

Agent: Sure. (pause) Okay, so we should be good now. What does that internet light look like? Is it still red?

Customer: (pause) No, it's... it's still red actually. Um, and the blinking light is still blinking.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try a different approach. Can you check your modem one more time? I want to make sure all the cables are plugged in nice and tight. There should be a cable coming in from the wall, and then a cable going to your router.

Customer: (pause) The one from the wall is plugged in. And... yeah, the other one's plugged into the router too. They both look secure.

Agent: Okay, good. And you're not seeing any loose cables or anything that looks damaged?

Customer: No, everything looks fine to me. I mean, I don't really know what I'm looking for, but nothing looks obviously wrong.

Agent: That's alright. Let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Michael, I'm showing that we do have your modem registered in our system, so that's good. But I'm not seeing an active internet signal coming to your location right now.

Customer: What does that mean? Like, the internet's not coming to my house at all?

Agent: Well, it could be a few different things. It could be an outage in your area that we're not aware of yet, or it could be an issue with the line coming into your house. Let me check our outage map. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any outages reported in your area at the moment, but sometimes those take a bit to get updated.

Customer: So what do I do? I really need this working today.

Agent: I understand. Let me try one more thing with you. I'm going to send a signal to your modem to see if we can get it to recognize the network. Just give me one second here. (typing sounds) Can you keep an eye on that internet light? Let me know if anything changes.

Customer: (pause) Nothing's changing. It's still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I sent the signal but it's not coming back online. Michael, at this point, I think we might be dealing with either a line issue outside your house or possibly a hardware problem with the modem itself. I have a couple of options for you. We can schedule a technician to come out and check the line and equipment—we'd have someone available tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Or, if you want, I can also send you a replacement modem, but that would take a few days to arrive.

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean, I guess that's... can't you guys come out sooner? Like, today?

Agent: Let me check. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any technician availability in your area for today, unfortunately. Tomorrow morning is the earliest slot we have open.

Customer: (sighs) Alright, I guess I'll have to do that. Can you schedule it for tomorrow?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that set up for you. And just to confirm, tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM works for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Perfect. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes, and the technician will likely reach out to you tomorrow morning a little bit before they arrive. Is there anything else I can help you with while we're on the line?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Hopefully the tech can figure out what's going on tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sure they will. I'm sorry we couldn't get you up and running today, but our technicians are really great and they'll get to the bottom of it. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

Customer: No, that's good. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
