Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um... my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the number on my bill.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm pulling that up now. And just to confirm, you're experiencing no internet connection at all, correct?

Customer: Right, nothing. The router's on, I can see the lights, but there's no internet. I've tried unplugging it a couple times already, but... yeah, nothing.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting on your part. I see you're on our Fiber plan with us. Let me just walk through a few things with you. When you look at your router, can you tell me what color the lights are? Are they green, amber, or...?

Customer: Um, let me look here... (pause) Okay, so I've got, like, a solid green light on the power, but the internet light... that one's amber. It's been amber since this morning.

Agent: Alright, so the amber light on the internet port is actually indicating that there's a connection issue between your modem and our network. Let's try a couple things. First, can you unplug your modem—not the router, but the modem, the device that connects directly to your wall outlet—and wait about 30 seconds before plugging it back in?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (sound of rustling) Okay, it's unplugged. I'm gonna count to thirty... (pause) ...and plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. And while that's booting back up, have you noticed any lights on your wall outlet or any kind of damage to the fiber line coming into your home?

Customer: Hmm, no, nothing looks weird from what I can see. It's just behind my entertainment center, so... it's a little dark back there, but it looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay, no problem. So the modem should be back up now. What are you seeing on the lights?

Customer: (pause) Still amber. It's still showing amber on the internet light.

Agent: Alright, let me try a different approach. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? That's going to involve holding down the small reset button on the back of the device for about 10 seconds.

Customer: Oh, yeah? I'm gonna need a paperclip or something for that...

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, exactly. It's a small recessed button.

Customer: (background noise of searching) Okay, I got one. (pause) I'm holding it down... ten seconds... and... done.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about a minute to fully restart.

Customer: Okay. (long pause) ...Still nothing. Still amber.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check your account on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any service issues reported in your area, so that's actually good news. But I am going to check your modem status remotely. One moment... (pause) Yeah, I'm not getting a connection from your modem to our network, which is unusual.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it the modem itself?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be the modem, or it could be an issue with the fiber connection coming into your home. I'm thinking we might need to schedule a technician visit to come out and check your equipment and the line coming into your property.

Customer: [inaudible] How long would that take? I really need internet today if I can.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds, hold music briefly) Okay, I'm checking our tech schedule... The earliest I have is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Ugh, I guess so. I might have to call my boss and let him know... Can't you try anything else right now?

Agent: That's a good question. Um, let me think here... (pause) Well, one more thing we could try—do you happen to have access to the fiber connection point outside your home? Sometimes there's a small box on the exterior of the house.

Customer: There's like, a white box on the side of my house near the driveway?

Agent: Yes, that's likely it. Can you take a look and see if there's a small red button or any kind of indicator light on it?

Customer: Yeah, I can go check. (pause, background noise of door opening, wind) Okay, I'm looking at it. There's like... a little light, but it's not lit up. Or it's not red. It's just... dark.

Agent: Okay, that's actually what we'd expect when there's a connection issue downstream. Unfortunately, that confirms that we need a technician to come out and investigate. There might be an issue with the fiber line itself or the equipment.

Customer: So there's nothing you can do right now?

Agent: I wish there was, but based on what we're seeing—the amber light on your modem, the remote diagnostics showing no connection, and the external connection point not lighting up—it really does point to something physical that needs to be checked on-site. I know it's not ideal timing for you.

Customer: No, it's... it's frustrating, but I understand. So tomorrow morning, 8 to 12?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. Let me get you booked in. I'm going to need a contact number for the technician to reach you, just to confirm the appointment.

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as my account number.

Agent: Perfect, and I'm showing that as your mobile number. The technician will call 30 minutes before arrival. Your appointment is confirmed for tomorrow, Tuesday, between 8 AM and noon. There will be no service call fee since this is our equipment. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Hopefully the tech can figure it out tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident they will. I apologize you're experiencing this, especially when you're working from home. We really appreciate your patience, and we'll get this sorted out for you. Thank you for calling Frontier.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.
