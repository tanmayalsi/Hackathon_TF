Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried restarting the modem and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Maplewood area. And you mentioned you've already restarted the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I unplugged it for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in. But the lights are still doing weird stuff. Like, they're blinking red and orange instead of the normal green and blue that I usually see.

Agent: Okay, that's actually a good observation. The red and orange lights typically indicate a connection issue. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the power light on?

Customer: Um, yeah, the power light is on. It's solid white. But then the other lights are just... they're blinking, like I said. Red and orange. And nothing's connecting.

Agent: Got it. Alright, so let me ask you a few questions. Have you noticed any service outages in your area, or did anything happen recently? Like a storm or anything?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine. It was working perfectly fine this morning and then around 4 PM it just... stopped.

Agent: Okay. And just to confirm, you've restarted the modem. Have you also tried unplugging the router if you have a separate router?

Customer: Oh, wait. Um, actually I'm not sure if I have a separate router or not. I thought the modem was all of it?

Agent: (pause) That's a good question. Can you look at the device and tell me what it looks like? Is it a white box with "Frontier" written on it?

Customer: Yeah, it's white and says Frontier on it. But I don't see anything else plugged in, so I think that's just... the one thing.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so that's all-in-one—that's your modem and router combined. Alright, let me check the line on my end to see if we're seeing any issues from our side. (typing sounds) I'm going to put you on just a brief hold while I run a quick diagnostic. This should only take about a minute or two.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Okay, I'm back. So, I'm actually not seeing any outages in your area right now, and your line appears to be active on my end. That's interesting. Let me try a different approach. Can you do me a favor? Can you look at the modem and see if there's a small reset button? It's usually recessed in a little hole.

Customer: (pause) Let me look... (background noise of device being moved) Yeah, I see it. There's like a tiny button in a little hole. You want me to press it?

Agent: Hold on, before you do that—I want to make sure we've exhausted the other options first, because pressing that button will completely reset the device to factory settings. We'd have to set it all back up. Let me try something else. Is there a coaxial cable running into the modem? It should be a thick cable with a connector on each end.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I see it. It's... it looks like it's plugged in pretty firmly.

Agent: Okay, good. Can you unplug it for me? Just count to ten and plug it back in?

Customer: (unplugging sounds) Okay, unplugging now... (pause) ...one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Plugging back in.

Agent: Alright. Let me give that about thirty seconds to resync. (pause) And... do you see any changes on the lights yet?

Customer: No, it's still the same. Red and orange blinking. The power light is still solid, but everything else is just... blinking.

Agent: (sighs) Okay. Um, alright. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to run another line test... (pause) Hmm. You know what, I'm actually showing that your equipment might be having an issue. On our network, everything looks normal—the line is active—but your modem isn't registering with us properly. 

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It could be an issue with the modem itself, or it could be something with the connection between our network and your device. Let me try one more thing before we talk about next steps. I want you to try that factory reset. I know it's a pain, but it might clear out whatever's wrong with the device. You'll need to use a paperclip or something to press that button for about ten seconds while it's powered on.

Customer: Okay, let me... (background noise) I've got a paperclip. (pause) So I'm pressing this button?

Agent: Yes, press and hold it. Go ahead.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... and... oh, okay, all the lights went off. Is that... is that supposed to happen?

Agent: Yeah, that's normal. They should come back on in a moment. Just give it about a minute to boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay... yeah, they're coming back on. The lights are... oh. They're still doing the same thing. Red and orange blinking.

Agent: (pause) Okay... that's not great. Um, alright. Let me check the network again. (typing sounds) Yeah, so the device still isn't connecting properly to our system. 

Customer: So... what do I do? I need my internet. I work from home.

Agent: I understand, and I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. So here's what I'm thinking. The modem might be defective. It could be a hardware failure, especially if the factory reset didn't resolve it. I can send you a replacement modem, but that would take about 3 to 5 business days to arrive. Or... (pause) ...or we can schedule a technician to come out. They could come out as early as tomorrow morning to diagnose what's happening and either fix it or swap the equipment on site.

Customer: How long would a technician visit take?

Agent: Typically, these calls run anywhere from one to two hours. But they'd be able to get you back up and running right away instead of waiting for shipping.

Customer: Yeah, I think I'd rather do that. Can you schedule someone for tomorrow?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me check our availability in your area. (typing sounds) I'm showing we have morning appointments available between 8 AM and 12 PM, or afternoon between 1 PM and 5 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: Morning is better. I'd rather get it done early.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, you're all set for tomorrow, August 15th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. A technician will come out to your address. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes. Is there a phone number where they can reach you if they need to?

Customer: Yeah, it's the same number on the account.

Agent: Great. And just to set expectations, there's a $99 service call fee if the issue turns out to be with the device or something internal to your home setup. But if it's something on our end, that fee will be waived. Does that work for you?

Customer: I mean, I guess so. But hopefully it's not going to cost me anything.

Agent: I understand. Fingers crossed it's something simple. Is there anything else I can help you with tonight, or do you have any other questions?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... hopefully this gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I really hope so too. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working tonight. But our technician is great, and they'll figure out what's going on. In the meantime, if you have any updates or if anything changes, feel free to give us a call back. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: Alright, thank you for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your patience. Have a good night.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
