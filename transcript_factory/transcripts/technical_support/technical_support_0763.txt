Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging stuff but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here so we can get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847. That's my cell number, but it should be linked to my account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing your service address is on Maple Street in... Riverside?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Is that correct? And you've already tried restarting your modem?

Customer: Yeah, I unplugged it for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in. Still nothing. No lights on the modem at all actually, now that I think about it.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The fact that there are no lights is significant. That usually means the modem isn't getting power. Let me ask you this—is the power cable securely connected to the modem on your end?

Customer: Um... (pause) let me look... yeah, it's... it's plugged in. I mean, it looks plugged in. Wait, hold on. (sound of movement) Let me check the other end at the outlet.

Agent: Sure, go ahead.

Customer: Okay, yeah, it's plugged into the wall. Both ends look fine to me. The cable's not damaged or anything.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm, do you have power to that outlet? Like, is anything else plugged in there that's working?

Customer: Oh! Good question. Let me... (sound of something being moved) No, actually, nothing else is plugged in there. Should I try a different outlet?

Agent: That's a great idea. Why don't you try unplugging the modem and plugging it into a different outlet, maybe somewhere else in your home?

Customer: Okay, give me a second. (sound of movement, rustling) Alright, I'm gonna plug it in over here by the TV. (pause) Plugging it in now... and... nothing. Still no lights.

Agent: Hm, okay. So still no power indicator lights?

Customer: Nope. Nothing.

Agent: Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at the line here, and I'm not seeing any outages in your area currently. So it does seem like this might be a modem issue rather than a service outage. Have you tried using the power adapter that came with the modem, or are you using a different one?

Customer: It's the one that came with it, I think? I haven't changed anything. It's been working fine for like two years.

Agent: Okay, understood. Just so we can rule everything out—can you describe the power adapter to me? What color is it, and does it have any indicator lights on it?

Customer: (pause) It's... um... it's black, I think? And I'm looking at it now, and... there might be a little light on it, but I can't really tell if it's on or off. It's kind of hard to see.

Agent: Okay, see if you can feel if it's warm at all. Sometimes that can indicate whether it's actively providing power.

Customer: (pause) It's... it feels kind of cool actually. Not warm.

Agent: That's useful. That might suggest the adapter itself has stopped working. That would explain why the modem isn't powering on. Unfortunately, power adapters can fail over time, especially after two years of use.

Customer: Oh man. So what does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: Well, not necessarily a new modem—you might just need a replacement power adapter. But I want to try one more thing first before we go down that path. Do you have a similar power adapter anywhere else in your home? Maybe from another device? It would need to be around 12 volts and the connector would need to fit into the modem.

Customer: Um... I don't think so? I have a few chargers but they're all for phones and tablets. I don't think any of them would fit.

Agent: Okay, yeah, those likely won't work. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check our system for available service appointments. We can get you a replacement power adapter, and I want to see what we have available.

Customer: Alright, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays for approximately 45 seconds, then agent returns) Okay, I'm back. So I've checked our inventory and we do have replacement power adapters available. However, I'm also seeing something on my end that's a bit concerning. It looks like there might be a connectivity issue that started right around the time your internet went out.

Customer: What do you mean?

Agent: (typing sounds) Well, on the modem's connection history before it lost power, there are some unusual signal fluctuations. I'm wondering if maybe something else happened before the adapter failed. But honestly, until we can get power back to the modem and see the lights come on, I can't diagnose it fully.

Customer: Okay, so... what's my option here?

Agent: Well, we have a couple of options. I can schedule a technician visit to your home. They can bring a replacement adapter and, if needed, further diagnose any potential issues with the modem or line itself. The earliest I can get someone out there would be... (typing sounds) tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need my internet today. I work from home and I have a conference call at like 3 PM tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand. That's frustrating. Let me see if there's anything else I can do. (pause) Okay, I'm showing there's a technician in your area this evening, but the window would be between 5 and 7 PM. That's just a couple hours from now. Would that work for you?

Customer: Five to seven? That's... that's pretty tight, but yeah, I could try to make that work.

Agent: Excellent. Now, there is a service fee for a same-day visit, which would be $89.99 in this case. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule that?

Customer: (pause) $89.99? Ugh. I mean... yeah, I guess if the modem's broken, I don't really have a choice. Go ahead.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that set up for you now. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm scheduling the appointment... and... (pause) Actually, I'm getting an error in the system. Let me try that again.

Customer: What kind of error?

Agent: (pause) It looks like there might be a system glitch on our end. Just give me one moment. (typing sounds, longer pause) I apologize for this. The system isn't accepting the appointment request. This sometimes happens when there's a service issue flagged on the account.

Customer: You've got to be kidding me.

Agent: I know, I apologize. Let me try a different approach here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to try entering it manually. (pause) Still nothing. Unfortunately, it looks like I'm going to need to escalate this to our scheduling department. They can get around this technical issue.

Customer: How long is that going to take?

Agent: It should only be a few minutes. I can transfer you to them right now, and they should be able to get you booked within the same timeframe.

Customer: Fine. Yeah, transfer me.

Agent: Perfect. Before I do that, let me just summarize what we've determined. Your modem is not powering on, and we believe the power adapter may have failed. A technician will come out to your home this evening if the scheduling department can get you in that window, and they'll bring a replacement adapter and can diagnose any further issues if needed. Does that sound right?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Great. I'm going to transfer you now to our scheduling team. They're going to be able to confirm that appointment. Thank you for your patience today, and I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved remotely.

Customer: Alright, thanks for trying.

Agent: You're welcome. One moment while I transfer you. (brief hold tone, then)

Agent (New): Thank you for holding. This is Diana from scheduling. I have your information here. Let me see what I can do to get you that same-day appointment...
