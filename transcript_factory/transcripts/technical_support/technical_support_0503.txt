# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet is completely down. It's been out since this morning and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at the account for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage since this morning. Let me ask you a few questions first. Are your lights on the modem and router showing anything at all?

Customer: Um, well, let me look... The modem has a red light, I think. Or maybe it's orange? It's definitely not green.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. A red light usually indicates either a connection issue or power problem. Is the modem plugged in?

Customer: Of course it's plugged in... (pause) Yes, it's definitely plugged in.

Agent: Great. And what about your router? Is it powered on?

Customer: The router... yeah, that one's got a light too, but it's not doing anything. Like, it's just dim or something.

Agent: Alright, so the router appears to be powered down or in standby. Let me have you do a quick restart. Can you unplug the modem first for about thirty seconds?

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just count to about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in for me. I'll wait.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Alright, it's plugged back in now. So what am I looking for?

Agent: Good. Give it about two minutes to boot back up. The lights should cycle through a few different colors, and eventually you should see a solid green light on the modem. While we wait for that, can you also unplug the router?

Customer: Sure, unplugging the router too... (pause) Done.

Agent: Perfect. So while the modem is coming back up, let me ask you... have there been any recent storms in your area? Or any work done on the lines?

Customer: Uh, no storms that I know of. There was some work a few days ago. The cable company... or wait, you guys, I guess. There was a truck out front doing something. But I think they were done.

Agent: Okay, that could be related. Sometimes after line work, connections can be a little finicky. (pause) How's that modem looking now? Any green lights?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... Hmm, I see... I think there's one green light now? There's some blinking going on too.

Agent: Excellent. The blinking is normal—that just means it's syncing. Go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: Okay. (pause) It's plugged in.

Agent: Great. That should take another minute or two to fully boot up. While we're waiting, have you tried connecting to the internet yet? Like, can you try opening a website on your phone or computer if you have wifi?

Customer: (pause) I can try... but honestly, I don't see the router network showing up on my phone. Usually I see... like three or four networks, you know?

Agent: That's probably because the router is still booting up. Give it another minute or so. (pause) Try it again—do you see your network now?

Customer: (pause) No, nothing yet. This is taking a while, isn't it? How long is this supposed to take?

Agent: It should be pretty quick, honestly. Usually within a couple minutes. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing a connection from your modem to our network yet, which would explain the issue. Have you checked if there are any visible cable connections? Like, is the coax cable firmly connected to the modem?

Customer: The coax cable... I'm not really sure where all these things are, man. There's a bunch of cables back there.

Agent: No problem. So looking at the modem, there's usually one cable that screws in—it's a little thicker than most cables. Can you see if there's a cable going into the back of the modem that looks like that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, I see it. It looks connected to me.

Agent: Can you try unscrewing it just a tiny bit and screwing it back in? Sometimes these connections get a little loose.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, I'm... I'm doing that. (pause) Alright, screwed back in.

Agent: Good. Let's give it another minute to see if the connection reestablishes. What I'm looking for on the modem is a light that says "internet" or sometimes it might just say "online." Is there anything labeled like that?

Customer: (pause) There's a ton of little lights. Um... I see "power," there's something that says "link," and then there's like... "downstream" and "upstream" I think?

Agent: Okay, so those lights give me a good idea. Are those showing green?

Customer: The power one is definitely on. The link one is... I think it's blinking? The other two I can't really tell in this light.

Agent: Alright, let me check my system again. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm still not registering a connection from your equipment to our network. This could mean a few things. It might be a line issue from our side, or there could be damage to the coax cable itself.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Let me try one more thing. Have you noticed any physical damage to the cable? Like, if you can trace it from the modem, is it crimped or damaged anywhere?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't think so. It just goes into the wall. I can't really see past that.

Agent: That makes sense. Okay, so what I'm seeing here is that your modem is powered on and appears to be working, but it's not able to establish a connection to our network. Given that there was line work done a few days ago, it's very possible there's a disruption on the line or an issue with the connection at the pole.

Customer: So you're saying it's not something I can fix myself?

Agent: Unfortunately, it doesn't look like it. I wish I could tell you otherwise. What I'm going to need to do is escalate this to our field service team. They'll be able to come out and check the line from our end and make sure everything's properly connected.

Customer: How long is that going to take? I need internet for work.

Agent: I understand completely. Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds) (pause) So we have availability tomorrow morning between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have an afternoon slot on Wednesday between 1 and 5 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning, I guess. I can't really wait longer than that.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get you scheduled for tomorrow morning. Just to confirm, is 555-0147 still the best number for our technician to reach you if they need to?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. You're all set for tomorrow between 8 and noon. A technician will come out and diagnose what's happening with the line. Is there anything else I can help you with tonight?

Customer: (pause) No, I guess that's it. I really hope they can get it working tomorrow.

Agent: I hope so too. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve it over the phone. The technician should be able to get you back up and running. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good night.

Customer: You too.
