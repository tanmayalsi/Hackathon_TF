Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get this fixed. I work from home and I'm completely dead in the water here.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the number on the bill.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, thank you David. And just to confirm, is this a residential fiber account?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've had it for about two years now, and it's been great until today.

Agent: Great, I see it here. Okay, so the service went down this morning you said? Have you tried doing a quick restart of your equipment yet?

Customer: No, I... I mean, should I do that? I wasn't sure what to do, so I just called right away.

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. That's actually the first thing we should try. It fixes most issues. Can you go ahead and unplug your modem and router for me? The modem is the device that connects to your wall outlet.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I see it. Unplugging now.

Agent: Great. Can you leave that unplugged for about thirty seconds? While you're doing that, let me just pull up your account details here.

Customer: Sure thing. (pause) Okay, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: Plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, it's booting up. I see the lights starting to come back on.

Agent: Good, good. Give it about two minutes to fully boot. While we wait, I'm showing that we had some maintenance in your area early this morning. That might have caused a brief service interruption. Let's see if the restart got you back up and running.

Customer: (pause) Alright, so... the lights are all on now, but... hmm, I'm not seeing an internet connection on my computer. Like, I can see the WiFi network, but when I try to connect, it's not working.

Agent: Okay, that's interesting. Let me ask you a few questions. Can you see the WiFi network name showing up on your computer?

Customer: Yeah, it's showing "Frontier-XXXXXX" or whatever. But when I click to connect, it just keeps asking me for a password.

Agent: Ah, okay. That actually sounds like the router may have reset to factory settings during the restart. That happens sometimes. Do you have your WiFi password? It should be on the back of your router, or we might have it on file here.

Customer: (pause) Hold on, let me look at the back. (pause) Okay, I see some numbers here. Is it the one that says "WiFi Password"?

Agent: That's exactly what I'm looking for. Go ahead and try entering that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, typing it in... (pause) Still not connecting. It just says "can't connect to this network."

Agent: Hmm, let's try a different approach. Can you look at your modem right now? Is there a light that's indicating internet connection? Usually it's labeled "Internet" or "WAN."

Customer: (pause) Um... I see a lot of lights here. There's green, there's... okay, there's one that says "Internet" and it's... it's not lit up. It's off.

Agent: Ah, okay. That's actually the issue. Your modem isn't receiving a signal from our network. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) 

Customer: Is that bad? Can you fix it remotely or something?

Agent: Let me see what I'm looking at here... (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any service interruptions right now on your line. The restart should have reconnected you. The fact that that Internet light isn't coming on tells me there might be an issue with the line itself. Can you look at your modem and tell me—is there a light that says "Online" or "Link"?

Customer: I mean, there's just so many lights. (pause) I see one that says "Link" and that one's... that one's green, yeah.

Agent: Okay, so you have a link but no internet light. And you said the maintenance was done this morning?

Agent: Right. Let me try something else. Can you do me a favor and do a hard reset on the modem? Hold down the reset button on the back—it's usually a small recessed button—for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Hard reset. Yeah, I'm doing that now. Holding it... (pause) Okay, it's been ten seconds.

Agent: Alright, let's give it another minute or two to cycle back on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back. Lights are coming on again. (pause) But... no internet light again.

Agent: Still nothing, huh? (pause) Okay, David, I'm not seeing any service issues on the account, but that internet light should definitely be on. I think what we might be dealing with is either a line issue—which would be on our end—or possibly an issue with the modem itself. When's the last time you upgraded your equipment?

Customer: I don't know, it came with the installation two years ago. So... I guess two years?

Agent: Okay. (typing sounds) You know what, let me escalate this to our technical team. This is beyond the standard troubleshooting at this point. I'm going to need to get a technician out to your location to physically check the line and your equipment. Can you hold for just one second while I check availability?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays, then cuts out) Thanks for holding, David. Okay, so I can get someone out to you tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have afternoon availability between 2 PM and 6 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't you do it today?

Agent: Unfortunately, today's pretty booked up. I know it's not ideal, but with the maintenance that was happening this morning, we've got quite a queue. Tomorrow's the soonest I can get you.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, I guess I'll take the morning slot then. 8 to 12.

Agent: Perfect. I'm getting that scheduled for you. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes. The technician will have all your account info. And just to confirm your address one more time—it's still 447 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just so you know, there's a $99 service call fee if this turns out to be a customer-side issue, but if it's something on our end—which I suspect it might be given what we're seeing—there won't be any charge. The technician will let you know once they've diagnosed it.

Customer: Okay, I guess that's fair. So tomorrow morning then.

Agent: That's right. And David, I really apologize for the inconvenience today. I wish we could've gotten this resolved over the phone.

Customer: Yeah, me too. But thanks for trying, I guess. I'll see the tech tomorrow.

Agent: Absolutely. Thanks for being patient with us, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day, David.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
