# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, uh, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm really frustrated because I have work from home and I can't get anything done.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: James Morrison.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, James. I have your account here. I'm showing you have our Frontier Fiber 500 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Okay, great. So let me start by asking a few quick questions. When you say your internet is down, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Like, is the modem powered on?

Customer: Um, yeah, the modem is on. I can see the lights, but... I don't know, they don't look right. Usually there's like a blue light that's solid, but right now it's just... blinking or something. And the Wi-Fi light isn't on at all.

Agent: Okay, so the modem is powered on but we're seeing some abnormal lights. That's helpful. And just to confirm, you're not able to connect to the internet at all right now?

Customer: No, nothing. I tried my laptop, I tried my phone, I even tried unplugging everything and plugging it back in, but still nothing.

Agent: Alright, you've already done the basic troubleshooting, which is good. Let me just walk through a couple more things to make sure we cover all the bases. Where is your modem located right now?

Customer: It's in my office, sitting on the desk. It's pretty close to my router.

Agent: Good. Can you tell me what model modem you have? There should be a sticker on top or the back with the model number.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me look... it says Arista something... Arista... AR-7400G? I think?

Agent: AR-7400G, perfect. That's one of our standard units. Okay, so what I'd like you to do is unplug the power cable from the back of the modem, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Sure, give me a second. (sounds of movement) Okay, unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. And while we're waiting, I should mention I'm not seeing any service alerts in your area, so that's a positive sign. This might just be a modem reset situation.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been about thirty seconds. Plugging it back in now. (pause) Alright, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Excellent. Now, the modem should take about two to three minutes to fully boot up. While it's doing that, can you tell me if there have been any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The power's been fine. It's just the internet that's acting up.

Agent: Okay. And have you noticed any damage to the cable line outside your house at all?

Customer: I haven't really looked, to be honest. Should I go check?

Agent: That would be helpful, yeah. Just take a quick look if you can. We're looking for any visible damage to the line running into your house, any loose connections, anything like that.

Customer: (background noise, sounds of movement) Okay, I'm looking now... I can see the cable coming from the box on the pole and it goes into my house. It looks fine to me, I don't see any damage or anything hanging loose.

Agent: That's good to know. Thanks for checking. Go ahead and head back inside. How's the modem looking now? Are those lights stabilizing at all?

Customer: (pause) Um, not really. The power light is solid now, but the internet light is still blinking. And there's a light that's like... yellow or amber colored? I'm not totally sure what that means.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so the internet light is blinking and there's an amber light. That could indicate a few things. Is there any other light that's on that's typically not on?

Customer: Yeah, actually, there's like an alarm light I think. There's a red light that's... oh, it just went out. Now the amber one is still blinking though.

Agent: Hmm, okay. The red light going out is actually a good sign. That amber light usually means it's trying to establish a connection but hasn't quite locked on yet. Let's give it another minute or so. Sometimes it takes a little while after a restart. Can you try connecting to the Wi-Fi on your phone and see if anything comes up?

Customer: (pause) Okay... no, still nothing. It's not even showing my network name as available anymore.

Agent: Alright, I'm going to try something on my end. Let me send a remote signal to your modem to try to reinitialize it. This should take about a minute.

Customer: Okay, I'm just... I'm just watching the lights.

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) Alright, I've sent that through. What you should see happen is all the lights might go out for a second and then they should come back on as the modem reinitializes itself.

Customer: (long pause) ...Yeah, the lights did go out for a second. They're coming back on now. Okay, so... um, the power light is solid, the internet light is still blinking, and now... wait, there's a green light that just came on.

Agent: Okay, so the green light is a good sign. That might be the Wi-Fi light. Can you try your phone again?

Customer: (pause) Let me see... I'm looking at my Wi-Fi networks... no, I'm still not seeing it. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I understand, I'm sorry. Let me try a different approach here. James, I'm going to need you to do a full factory reset on the modem. This is going to clear everything and we'll need to set it back up, but sometimes that's what we need to do. Are you okay with that?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I guess so. How do I do that?

Agent: On the back of the modem, there should be a small recessed button labeled "Reset." It might take a paperclip or something small to press it. You're going to hold that button down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (sounds of searching) Okay, I found it. I'm getting a paperclip... (pause) ...pushing it now. How long do I hold it?

Agent: Ten seconds should do it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, releasing it now. The lights just went crazy and now... now they're going out.

Agent: That's exactly what should happen. Now the modem is going to take several minutes to fully reset and reboot. This is a longer process, so we're probably looking at five to ten minutes before we see normal operation again.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I can wait.

Agent: While we're waiting, let me just let you know that after this reset, you'll need to reconnect to the Wi-Fi network, so you'll need your Wi-Fi password. Do you have that readily available?

Customer: Um, I think it's on a piece of paper somewhere, but I'm not sure. Can't you just... I don't know, can you reset that too?

Agent: The Wi-Fi network name and password will actually reset to the default, which is printed on the bottom of the modem. So we can use that for now if needed.

Customer: Okay, good. (long pause) So how much longer do you think this is going to take?

Agent: Another few minutes. Why don't you give me a status update on those lights?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the power light is back on and solid. The internet light is... it's still blinking. Same amber light from before. I'm not seeing the green light anymore. This doesn't seem like it's working either.

Agent: Hmm, that's unusual. Let me... (typing sounds, pause) ...let me check something on my end. I'm looking at your modem's connection history and I'm not seeing it successfully authenticate with our network since the factory reset. That suggests there might be an issue with the line itself or possibly the modem is faulty.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, what do I do?

Agent: Well, here's what I'm thinking. I want to try one more thing before we go further. Is there a coax cable connected to the modem? That's the cable that looks kind of like a TV cable?

Customer: Yeah, there's a cable in the back. I didn't unplug that one.

Agent: Good. Can you unplug that for me and just reseat it? Meaning pull it out and push it back in firmly.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, doing that now... pulling it out... and plugging it back in. It's pretty snug.

Agent: Alright. Let's see if that helps. Sometimes a loose connection can cause this exact issue.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, nothing's changed. The lights are the same.

Agent: (long pause) James, I've been reviewing your account and your modem's behavior here, and I'm not seeing the modem successfully connecting to our network at all. At this point, I have a couple of options for you. One would be to schedule a technician visit to your home to check the line and potentially replace the modem if it's defective. Or, if you want to try something else, you could pick up a replacement modem from one of our retail locations, but given that we've done several resets and the modem still isn't connecting, I'm fairly confident there's either a hardware issue with the modem or a line issue that needs to be assessed in person.

Customer: So... you're telling me you can't fix this over the phone?

Agent: Unfortunately, at this point, we've exhausted the remote troubleshooting options. The modem is not authenticating with our network, which typically means either the modem itself has failed or there's an issue with the line coming into your house. A technician would be able to test the line and determine which it is. I apologize that we weren't able to resolve this remotely.

Customer: (frustrated) This is really frustrating. I have meetings today that I can't do without internet.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm genuinely sorry about this. What I can do is see about getting a technician out to you as soon as possible. Let me check availability.

Customer: How soon can they be here?

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) So it looks like we have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have another slot on Thursday afternoon. Unfortunately, today is pretty booked. Can either of those work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning, I guess. That's better than nothing.

Agent: Great, let me get that scheduled for you. I'm going to get a technician out tomorrow, 8 AM to noon window. They should be able to resolve this for you. Can I get a phone number where they can reach you?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Perfect. So to recap, we have a service appointment scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. The technician will test your line and your modem to determine what the issue is. You should receive a confirmation call or email shortly. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess... I guess that's it. I just really need this fixed by tomorrow because I have important calls.

Agent: I completely understand. The technician will get you sorted out. I'm going to make a note on your account about the troubleshooting we did today, so when they arrive, they'll already know what we've tried. James, I appreciate your patience today, and again, I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved right now.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too.
