Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got work from home stuff I need to do and I'm kind of freaking out here.

Agent: I completely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I'm showing an account for a Mr. Rodriguez?

Customer: Yeah, that's me. James Rodriguez.

Agent: Perfect, James. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have you tried restarting your modem and router yet?

Customer: Uh, no, I haven't actually. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yes, that's usually our first step. Go ahead and unplug your modem—that's the device where your cable comes in—and while you're doing that, also unplug the router if you have one.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, both unplugged. Now what?

Agent: Wait about 30 seconds, then plug the modem back in first. Let me know when the lights come back on.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's booting up... lights are coming on... there's a solid blue light and a blinking green one. Is that normal?

Agent: Actually, let me check on your account here. (typing sounds) I'm actually seeing that we might have an outage in your area. Let me verify that with you real quick. What area are you located in?

Customer: I'm in the Riverside neighborhood, near the shopping center on Mill Street.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm not showing any active outages on my end in that area right now. Let's continue troubleshooting. Did you plug the router back in?

Customer: Oh, no, I didn't. Let me do that now. (rustling) There we go. How long should it take to boot back up?

Agent: Usually about two to three minutes. While we're waiting, have you noticed any visible damage to your cables or equipment? Any water damage or anything like that?

Customer: No, everything looks fine to me. The modem and router both look normal. I don't see anything out of place.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, you're getting no internet connection at all? No WiFi showing up on your phone or computer?

Customer: Right, nothing. My phone is connected to the WiFi but it's not actually loading anything. Pages just time out.

Agent: Alright, it sounds like the devices are connecting to the router, but the router isn't getting a signal from the modem. Let me ask you this—is there a light on the modem that indicates an internet connection? It's usually labeled as "Internet" or sometimes "WAN."

Customer: (pause) Hmm, let me look at this again. I see... online, offline... there's an "offline" light that's red.

Agent: That's the issue right there. The modem isn't connecting to our network. Did you recently install this equipment or have it for a while?

Customer: We've had it for probably two years, maybe more.

Agent: Okay. I'm going to have you try unplugging the modem one more time for about a minute. Sometimes the modem needs a full reset to reconnect properly.

Customer: (unplugging sounds) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: (pause) Go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Yeah, it's back in. Lights are coming on again...

(long pause with static)

Agent: Still there, James?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here. It's booting up again. Same lights as before though.

Agent: Still showing that offline light?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the red offline light is still there. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize. Let me try a couple more things. Can you check the cable connection on the back of the modem? Just make sure it's firmly connected where it enters the modem.

Customer: (rustling) Okay, I'm looking at it. The cable is... yeah, it seems pretty tight. Doesn't look loose to me.

Agent: Try gently disconnecting it and reconnecting it just to make sure it's seated properly.

Customer: (sounds of disconnecting and reconnecting) Alright, it's back in. Same issue though. Still offline.

Agent: (pause) Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to send a signal to your modem to see if it responds. This might take just a moment.

(pause)

Agent: Okay, it's not responding to my signal. That usually indicates either a connectivity issue on the line itself or possibly a problem with the modem hardware. Given that you've had the equipment for two years, it's possible the modem is starting to fail.

Customer: Are you serious? So what does that mean?

Agent: Here's what I can do. I can schedule a technician to come out and diagnose the issue. They'll be able to check the line, test the modem, and either repair it or replace it for you. Are you available tomorrow?

Customer: (sighs) I guess I have to be. What time are we talking?

Agent: Let me check availability. (typing sounds) I can get someone out there between 1 and 5 PM tomorrow. Would that work for you?

Customer: That's fine, but I really need this fixed soon. I can't work from home without internet.

Agent: I completely understand. The technician will be your priority. Before we confirm though, let me try one more thing. Are you tech-savvy at all? Do you feel comfortable accessing your modem's settings?

Customer: Um, not really. I mean, I can barely use this stuff.

Agent: No problem. (pause) Let me check... unfortunately without the modem connecting, I don't have many more options to troubleshoot remotely. I think the technician visit is really your best bet here.

Customer: Okay, so what's the next step?

Agent: I'm going to set up that appointment for you. The technician will arrive tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM at your address on file. Can you confirm that address is still 447 Riverside Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And a phone number they can reach you at if they're running early or late?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account.

Agent: Great. So you're all set for tomorrow. You should receive a confirmation email shortly. In the meantime, if anything changes or you want to try anything else, just give us another call back. But James, I want to be honest with you—it's likely going to be a hardware issue, so the technician will get you taken care of.

Customer: Alright. I guess I'll just have to use my phone's hotspot for work today. This is really inconvenient.

Agent: Again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get you back online as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, James. Thank you for being a Frontier Communications customer, and we apologize again for the service interruption. Have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
