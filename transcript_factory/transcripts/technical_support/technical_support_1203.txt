# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried restarting the router and everything, and it's just not coming back up.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got you here. So you mentioned you restarted the router—did you unplug it, or just use the reset button?

Customer: I unplugged it. Left it off for like, I dunno, five or ten minutes, and plugged it back in.

Agent: Good, that's the right approach. Okay, so when you plug it back in, what lights are you seeing on the modem and router right now?

Customer: (pause) Um... there's like a power light that's on, it's steady green. But the internet light—I think it's called the internet light—it's just amber or orange or something. It won't turn green.

Agent: Alright, that's actually helpful information. The orange light typically means it's not connecting to the network. Let me ask you a few questions. First, do you see any other lights that are flashing or anything unusual?

Customer: No, just the orange one. Everything else is like, normal.

Agent: Okay, and when did this start exactly? Was it working last night?

Customer: Yeah, it was working fine last night. I was actually on my laptop until like eleven or so, and then this morning when I went to check my email, nothing.

Agent: Got it. So there wasn't a storm or any kind of power outage that you noticed?

Customer: No, not that I saw. It's been clear all morning.

Agent: Alright. Well, let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm going to check your modem status. One moment, please. (brief pause) Okay, so on our end, we're not seeing your modem connecting to the network at all. That's consistent with what you're telling me. Let me have you try something for me. Can you unplug the modem this time? Not the router, just the modem.

Customer: The modem... okay. Is that the one with all the cable connections?

Agent: Yes, exactly. The big box usually near where your cable comes in.

Customer: Okay, so I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. Leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds, and then go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's back in. There's a power light, and now it's... (pause) ...it's blinking. The lights are blinking now.

Agent: Good, that's normal. It takes a minute or two to boot up. Why don't you give it about two minutes and then tell me what you're seeing?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... the power light is still on and green, which is good, but the internet light is still orange. It's not blinking anymore, it's just solid orange.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's... not what we want to see. Let me try something else. On the modem itself, there should be a small reset button. It's usually recessed pretty far in. Do you have a paperclip handy?

Customer: A paperclip? Yeah, I think so. Hold on. (pause) Okay, I've got one.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and press and hold that reset button for about ten seconds. Just be aware that this will reset the modem to factory settings, so we might need to reconfigure some things after.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...holding it... (pause) ...ten seconds, right? Okay, I'm letting go.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait another two minutes or so for it to fully restart.

Customer: (pause, background noise of tapping) Alright, I'm watching it... the lights are cycling through now... okay, they've stopped. Power light is green, but... (sighs) ...the internet light is still orange.

Agent: (pause) Okay, still orange. Hmm. Alright, let me check something. James, is there anything connected to the modem right now? Any cables coming in besides the one from outside?

Customer: Just the one from outside, and then I've got the router connected to it with an ethernet cable.

Agent: Can you try disconnecting that ethernet cable from the modem?

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's disconnected.

Agent: And how's that light now?

Customer: Still orange. Nothing changed.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Let me check the line from our end. I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I check some things with the network. It should just be a minute or two. Is that okay?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (brief hold music) Thank you for holding. Okay, James, I've checked the line from our end and I'm seeing an issue. It looks like we might be getting a signal, but it's really degraded, which is preventing the modem from properly synchronizing. That could indicate an issue with the line itself, or possibly a problem with the modem hardware.

Customer: Oh... so what does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: Well, that's one possibility. But before we go that route, I'd recommend getting a technician out to check the line and see if there's a physical issue. They can also bring a different modem to test and rule out whether it's the modem or the line.

Customer: How long would that take?

Agent: For a service visit? We'd probably be looking at sometime tomorrow or the day after, depending on availability in your area. Let me check what we have. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing availability tomorrow between two and four PM, or Wednesday morning between ten and noon.

Customer: (sighs) This is the first time I've had an issue with this service, so... I mean, I guess I'll take tomorrow between two and four?

Agent: Perfect. I'll get that scheduled for you. Can I get a callback number for the technician to reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, it's the same number as the account.

Agent: Great, so 555-0147. And is there a best time to reach you aside from that window?

Customer: Anytime after like nine in the morning should be fine.

Agent: Excellent. Let me just confirm all this. We have James Mitchell, service address 847 Oakmont Drive, scheduling a technician visit for tomorrow, tomorrow being Wednesday, between two and four PM. The technician will assess the line and test the modem to determine what's causing the connection issue. Your reference number for this visit is... (typing sounds) ...F-7-4-9-2-8-5.

Customer: Okay, F-7-4-9-2-8-5. Got it.

Agent: Perfect. You should receive a confirmation email shortly as well. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's all I've got. I appreciate your help, even though we couldn't figure it out right away.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize you're experiencing this issue. Hopefully our technician will get everything sorted out tomorrow. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and have a great rest of your day.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. You too.

Agent: Bye, James.

Customer: Bye.
