Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, uh, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I work from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And what's the best name to have on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Has it been completely out since then, or are you getting any connection at all?

Customer: No, it's completely out. Like, nothing. I tried restarting my router this morning and that didn't help. I've been without internet for... I don't know, like five or six hours now.

Agent: Okay, let's troubleshoot this together. First, can you tell me... is your modem still powered on? Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Yeah, um, let me look at it. (pause) The modem's on, but... the internet light isn't on. It's just the power light and I think the phone light.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. That suggests the modem isn't getting a signal from our network. Let's try restarting the modem. Can you do that for me? Just unplug it, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in.

Customer: Sure, give me a second. (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (longer pause) Alright, I'm waiting... thirty seconds, right?

Agent: That's right.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) It's coming back on now. The lights are... okay, the power light came back on. We're waiting for the internet light...

Agent: (pause) Anything yet?

Customer: No, nothing. Still just the power and phone lights. This is... this isn't normal, right?

Agent: No, ideally we'd want to see that internet light come back on within a minute or so. Let me check our network on my end here to see if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) Can I get your service address, David?

Customer: Yeah, it's 447 Maple Drive, apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any major outages reported in your area right now. That's actually... hmm. Let me ask you something. Do you have a battery backup unit on your modem, or is it plugged directly into the wall?

Customer: I think it's just plugged into the wall. It's plugged into an outlet behind my desk.

Agent: Okay, so it's getting power. Um, let me have you check something. Can you look at the back of the modem and tell me if there are any cables that might have gotten loose? Sometimes these things can shake a bit if someone bumped into them or something.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking now. There's like three cables back here... the power cord, and then there's the fiber line and... I guess a phone cord? (pause) They all look pretty tight to me.

Agent: Okay, good. So the fiber line is definitely connected?

Customer: I mean, it looks connected. It's pretty snug. I don't see it moving or anything.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Let me check something else. Is your router showing any lights? Do you have a separate router or is the modem all-in-one?

Customer: No, I have a separate router. It's... okay, so the modem has power but no internet light. And my router, um... (pause) the power light is on but the internet light on the router is off too.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. If the modem isn't getting signal, the router won't either. Okay, let me try a factory reset of the modem. This might take a few minutes. There should be a small reset button on the back of the modem. It's usually recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something to press it.

Customer: Okay, I'm looking. (pause) Yeah, I see a little button that says "reset." Is that it?

Agent: That's the one. Can you press and hold it for about ten seconds?

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... (longer pause) That's ten seconds. I've let go. The lights went off and now they're coming back on again.

Agent: Okay, good. Let's wait and see if the internet light comes back this time. This might take a minute.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm... I'm still waiting. The power light's on... phone light's on... (pause) ...no internet light yet.

Agent: (pause) Anything?

Customer: No, still nothing. How long should this take?

Agent: It should be pretty quick, honestly. Within a minute or two. We might be looking at a hardware issue here. Um, or possibly a line issue on our end. Let me check your service status in our system... (typing sounds, longer pause)

Customer: Are you still there?

Agent: Yes, sorry, I'm here. I'm checking a few things. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that your service is active on our end. We're not getting any indication of a problem from the network side. But the fact that your modem isn't coming online after the reset... that's concerning. It's possible the modem itself is having an issue, or there could be a problem with the fiber line coming into your building.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, do I need a new modem?

Agent: Well, let's not jump to that conclusion just yet. Um, since you're in an apartment, do you have access to where the fiber line enters the building? Or is that in a locked area?

Customer: I mean, there's like a network closet in the hallway, but I don't have a key to it. The landlord has it.

Agent: Okay, yeah, that's typical. Unfortunately, I'm not able to... I mean, the issue could be anywhere from the network equipment in that closet to your modem. And I'm not really in a position to send a technician out without doing a few more things. (pause) Let me put you on a brief hold while I check with my supervisor to see what our next steps should be. It'll just be a minute.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, then agent returns) Okay David, I'm back. So I spoke with my supervisor and here's the situation: we can definitely send a technician out to your location. That would be the best way to pinpoint exactly where the issue is. However, the earliest we have availability is tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... I really need this today if possible. I have important calls I need to make for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see if there's anything else we can try right now. Um, is there any chance you could restart your entire setup one more time? Sometimes that helps reset the line on our end too.

Customer: I already did that, like, three times today.

Agent: Right, right. (pause) Okay, well... let me have you try one more time, but this time I want you to unplug everything—the modem and the router—wait about a minute, and then plug just the modem back in first. Don't plug in the router yet. Let's see if that makes a difference.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, I guess it's worth a try. (pause) Unplugging everything now. (longer pause) Waiting a minute... (pause) Okay, now I'm plugging just the modem back in.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let's give it thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, checking the lights... power's on, phone's on... (pause) ...still no internet light.

Agent: (longer pause) I'm sorry, David. I think at this point we've exhausted the basic troubleshooting steps. This is most likely either a modem hardware issue or a line issue in your building. Unfortunately, I'm not able to resolve it from here.

Customer: So I really do have to wait until tomorrow?

Agent: I know it's not ideal. But yeah, I think a technician visit is the best path forward. I can schedule that for you right now if you'd like, and they'll be able to actually test the equipment and the line. Plus, if it is a modem issue, they might have a replacement with them.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Let's do that. But I need to be able to take a call from work, so can you at least try to get me something earlier in the day?

Agent: I'll set it for first appointment available, which is 8 AM to 12 PM tomorrow. How does that sound?

Customer: Okay, fine. That works.

Agent: Great. So I have you scheduled for tomorrow, the 15th, 8 AM to 12 PM. Your confirmation number is 7-9-4-2-6-8-5. Can I get a good callback number to confirm this appointment?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147, same as my account.

Agent: Perfect. And just to make sure we have everything, your address is 447 Maple Drive, apartment 3B, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. The technician will have to access that network closet in your hallway, so you might want to give your landlord a heads up. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just really hope they can fix it tomorrow morning.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today. But our technician will take great care of you. Thanks for being such a patient customer, David, and sorry again for the trouble.

Customer: Yeah, thanks anyway. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. Have a great day.
