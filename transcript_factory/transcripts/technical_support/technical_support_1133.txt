# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. Okay, so it looks like you're on our Fiber 500 plan. And you're saying your internet went down this morning?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 AM. I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing. The WiFi shows up on my devices but it won't actually connect, or like, it connects but there's no internet going through.

Agent: Okay, that helps. So the router is powered on and you can see the WiFi network available?

Customer: Yes, exactly. And I can click on it and it says connected, but then when I try to open anything, it just... it doesn't work.

Agent: Alright, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what color the lights are on your Frontier router right now?

Customer: (pause) Um, okay, let me go look at it. (background noise of footsteps) I'm looking at it now. There's a white light on the top that's solid. And then there's... there's a red light blinking on one of the other buttons.

Agent: Okay, there's a red blinking light. Do you know which port that is? Is it next to one of the ethernet ports, or...?

Customer: (pause) I'm not really sure. There's like a bunch of lights here. One's solid white, and then I see a red one that's blinking pretty fast actually.

Agent: Understood. The red blinking light typically indicates a problem with the connection. Let me have you do a couple of things. First, can you unplug the router from power? Just pull the cord out.

Customer: Yeah, I'm doing that now. (sound of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I'm going to have you wait about 30 seconds while that power cycles. Just give the system a moment to reset.

Customer: Okay... (pause) This is taking forever. How long are we doing this for?

Agent: Just a few more seconds. You can count to 30 in your head... and go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: Alright, plugging it back in. (sound of plugging in) Okay, it's back on.

Agent: Perfect. Now this should take a moment to boot up. You might see some lights blinking and changing. Let's give it about a minute to fully restart. While we're waiting, have you had any weather or outages in your area recently?

Customer: Not that I know of. It's been clear all day. No storms or anything.

Agent: Okay, good. And you haven't had any recent power outages or anything like that?

Customer: No, everything else has been working fine. Just the internet.

Agent: Alright. How's the router looking now? Are you seeing any changes in the lights?

Customer: Um, let me look. (pause) I'm still seeing that red light blinking. The white one's still solid too.

Agent: Still red, okay. What I'm going to do is have you check something for me. Can you look at the ethernet cable that goes into the back of the router? Is it plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's a cable... it looks plugged in. It feels pretty secure.

Agent: Can you unplug that ethernet cable and plug it back in? Sometimes they don't seat all the way.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm unplugging it. (sound of movement) Alright, pushing it back in. I can hear it click.

Agent: Good. Did the light change at all?

Customer: (pause) ...No, still red. Still blinking.

Agent: Okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm showing that your modem is online and connected on our network, so that's a good sign. The issue might be with the router itself. Can you try connecting to the internet through an ethernet cable directly? Do you have a laptop or computer nearby?

Customer: I have a laptop. Let me... okay, I'm going to get the ethernet cable. (pause) Do you want me to plug it directly into the modem? Is that what you're saying?

Agent: Actually, let me clarify. The router's the device with the lights we were just looking at, correct?

Customer: Right, yeah.

Agent: Okay, so I want you to take an ethernet cable and plug it directly into one of the ethernet ports on that router, and then plug the other end into your laptop.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that now. (sound of plugging in cable) Alright, it's plugged in.

Agent: Great. Now let's try opening a web browser or going to a website. Let me know if you get any connection.

Customer: (pause) I'm opening Chrome right now and... (longer pause) ...no, nothing. It's just loading and loading. It's not working.

Agent: Nothing's loading at all?

Customer: No, it just keeps trying to load and then it times out.

Agent: Okay. Let me ask you this – can you check if there's a coaxial cable, so that would be a cable that screws onto the back of your modem – do you see that?

Customer: Uh... (pause) There's a cable that screws on, yeah. It's connected to the wall.

Agent: Okay, and that cable feels secure? You can give it a gentle tug to make sure?

Customer: (sound of movement) Yeah, it feels like it's on there pretty tight.

Agent: Alright, I'm going to be honest with you here. We've done the basic troubleshooting and I'm still seeing that red light you mentioned, which indicates the router isn't establishing a proper connection even though the modem is online. This could be a few things – it could be the router itself is failing, or there could be a line issue we're not catching. 

Customer: Oh man, so what do I do? I work from home. I need internet.

Agent: I understand. Let me see what options we have. (typing sounds) What I'd like to do is schedule a technician to come out to your place and do a full diagnostic. They can check the line, the modem, and determine if it's a hardware issue.

Customer: How soon can they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) I'm looking at our availability... we have an opening tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we can get someone out there on... Thursday between 9 AM and 1 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow would be better. I need to try to work if I can.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM. Is there anything else I should note for the technician? Like any other issues you've been experiencing?

Customer: Just that the internet isn't working. That's the main issue.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. Alright, I've got that scheduled for you. You'll receive a confirmation call about an hour before the technician arrives. In the meantime, if you do get internet back for some reason, just give us a call and let us know and we can cancel that appointment.

Customer: Okay. Do you think it's something that's going to be expensive to fix?

Agent: I really can't say until the technician takes a look at everything. If it's a service line issue, there's no charge. If it's equipment, we can discuss options. But let's see what they find tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, I guess that's all I can do.

Agent: I know it's frustrating. We really appreciate your patience, and we'll get this sorted out for you tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
