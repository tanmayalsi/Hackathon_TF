# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I work from home, so this is kind of urgent.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And just to confirm, is this still the address on file? 412 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So your internet's completely down as of this morning. Have you tried unplugging the modem and router yet?

Customer: Um, not yet. Like, right now?

Agent: Yeah, if you could do that for me. Just unplug both devices, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug them back in. That resolves a lot of issues actually.

Customer: (pause) Okay, give me one second. (background noise, shuffling) Alright, they're unplugged. (pause) Waiting... okay, plugging them back in now. The modem's got the lights coming back up.

Agent: Good, good. How long have you had your modem with us?

Customer: I want to say like... three years? Maybe four?

Agent: Okay, and is that a Frontier-provided modem or did you purchase your own?

Customer: It's the one you guys provided.

Agent: Got it. (pause) So what lights are you seeing on the modem right now?

Customer: Um, there's a green light on the... I think it says "internet" on it. And there's... (pause) ...there's a red light on one that says "battery."

Agent: Okay, so the red battery light is normal if it's a backup battery unit. That just means it needs charging. The important thing is the internet light. So you should be good. Do you have any devices connected right now that you could test? Like your laptop or phone?

Customer: Yeah, I can try my laptop. Hold on. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I'm getting no connection. It's showing the Wi-Fi network is available but when I try to connect, it just says "no internet."

Agent: Hmm, alright. (pause) Let's try a few more things. Can you tell me what Wi-Fi network name you're seeing?

Customer: Um, it says "Frontier-5847."

Agent: Perfect. And you're trying to connect with your Wi-Fi password?

Customer: Yeah, the one on the back of the router.

Agent: Good. Let me pull up your account here and see if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, let me check... and I'm not seeing any service alerts on your account right now. Can you try restarting your laptop as well?

Customer: Oh, really? Okay, sure. (pause) Yeah, it's booting back up now. (longer pause) Alright, restarted. Still the same thing—says no internet.

Agent: Okay. (pause) So the network is showing up, which is good. That means the router is broadcasting. Let me have you try something else. Can you unplug just the router this time? Keep the modem plugged in. Wait about a minute, then plug the router back in.

Customer: Just the router, not the modem. Got it. (pause, background noise) Alright, unplugged. (pause) It's been about a minute. (pause) Plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, the lights are coming back up on it.

Agent: Great. Give it about 30 seconds to fully boot up, and then try connecting again.

Customer: (pause) ...Alright, trying now. (pause) Nope, still nothing. Still says no internet. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I understand, I'm sorry you're dealing with this. (pause) Let me try pulling up some additional diagnostics on my end. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I'm showing your modem is online and communicating with our network, which is weird because...

Customer: Wait, so you can see it's working on your end?

Agent: The modem is registered and online, yes. But if you're not getting internet on your devices, that typically means there's either an issue with the router or with the connection between the modem and router. (pause) Did anything happen last night? Like a storm or a power outage?

Customer: Oh, actually, yeah. We did have some pretty bad thunderstorms last night. Could that have damaged something?

Agent: That could definitely be it. Storms can cause issues with equipment. (pause) Let me have you try one more thing. Can you check the cables going into the modem? There should be one coming from the wall outlet and one going to the router. Can you make sure they're both firmly connected?

Customer: (pause, sounds of movement) Yeah, I'm checking now. (pause) The one from the wall seems tight. The one going to the router... (pause) ...actually, it looks a little loose. Let me push it in. (click) There, that's tighter now.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about 30 seconds and see if that helps.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, still nothing. I'm not getting any connection still.

Agent: (pause) Alright, um... let me check something here. (typing sounds, longer pause) Okay, so the modem is still showing online on my end, but there does seem to be... some activity that's a little unusual. I want to escalate this to our technical team because at this point, it might be a hardware issue with either the modem or router, or possibly a line issue. How soon could you be home for a technician visit?

Customer: Really? A technician? How long is that going to take?

Agent: I can get someone out to you within the next 24 to 48 hours. I know that's not ideal since you work from home, but given what I'm seeing, I think we need someone to come check the equipment in person.

Customer: (sighs) That's... okay. I guess I don't have a choice. Can you do sooner? Like tomorrow morning?

Agent: Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds, pause) We do have a morning slot available tomorrow between 8 and 12 PM. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that works. That's better than nothing.

Agent: Perfect. I've got you scheduled for tomorrow morning. The confirmation number is FR-928451. You should get a text message and an email with that information shortly. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's... I mean, I guess not. Just, when the technician comes, they'll be able to fix it?

Agent: They'll definitely take a look and diagnose the issue properly. It could be as simple as a reset or it could be that we need to replace some equipment. But they'll get to the bottom of it.

Customer: Okay, alright. Well, thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: Of course, I'm sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone. But hopefully tomorrow we'll get you back up and running. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, sorry for the inconvenience. We'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye.
