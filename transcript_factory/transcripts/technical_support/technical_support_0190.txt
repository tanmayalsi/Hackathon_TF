Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went out completely and I have no idea what's going on. I need to get this fixed pretty urgently if possible.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my phone number on file.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Brennan.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, I've got you here, David. So you're saying your internet is completely down right now? No connection at all?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. I've got my laptop right here and there's just... no WiFi connection showing up. And my router—I'm looking at it—the lights are all dark. Like, completely dark.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The fact that the router lights are off is actually a good starting point. Have you checked to make sure it's plugged in?

Customer: (slight laugh) I mean... yeah, it's plugged in. I can see the power cable right here.

Agent: Right, right, of course. Um, could you try unplugging it for about thirty seconds and then plugging it back in? Sometimes that can reset things.

Customer: Sure, okay. (pause) Give me just a second. (background noise of unplugging) Alright, it's unplugged. I'm gonna wait... (long pause) Okay, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (background noise) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) So I'm waiting for the lights to come back on...

Agent: (pause) Are you seeing any lights at all now?

Customer: Um... okay, I'm seeing a green light on the bottom, but the other lights aren't turning on yet. Is that normal?

Agent: Yeah, that's actually normal. It takes about a minute or so for it to fully boot up. Why don't we give it another thirty seconds or so?

Customer: Okay. (pause) Yeah, so now I'm seeing... wait, I see one more light coming on. It's like a blue or green light next to where it says "Internet" on the router.

Agent: Great. So is that light steady, or is it blinking?

Customer: It's blinking. It's definitely blinking.

Agent: Okay, so that means it's trying to establish a connection. That's actually a good sign. Let's give it another minute to see if it stabilizes.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm just... waiting here. (pause) Okay, so it's still blinking. It's been like thirty seconds and it's still blinking.

Agent: Hmm, usually it should stabilize pretty quickly. Let me pull up your service account here and see if there's anything on our end. (typing sounds) (pause) David, are you in the Portland area?

Customer: Yeah, Southeast Portland. Jade District.

Agent: (typing) Okay, I'm just checking our service map. One second. (pause) I'm not showing any outages in your area right now, so it shouldn't be an issue on our end. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on the router right now?

Customer: So there's the green light at the bottom that's steady, and then the Internet light is... it's blinking slower now actually. And I don't see any other lights lit up.

Agent: Do you see a light that says "Online" or just "Internet"?

Customer: It just says "Internet" with like a little icon next to it.

Agent: Okay, and is there a light up top that might show the power, or any other indicators?

Customer: There's... yeah, there's a power light at the top left, but it's not on. Shouldn't that be on?

Agent: (pause) Yeah, actually that's... that should definitely be on if the router is powered up. Are you looking at the front of the router?

Customer: Yeah, the front. It's a white box, pretty standard looking.

Agent: Okay. So the power light isn't on. That's actually... that suggests the power might not be reaching the router properly. Can you check the outlet it's plugged into? Maybe try plugging something else into that same outlet, like a lamp?

Customer: (pause) Um, okay, hold on. I've got a lamp right here. (background noise) Let me unplug the router and... (pause) okay, plugging in the lamp. (pause) The lamp is on. So the outlet works.

Agent: Okay, good, so it's not the outlet. Let me try something else. Can you check the power cord itself? Sometimes these cables can get damaged. Is there any visible damage to it, or is it kinked or anything?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... (pause) No, it looks fine to me. It's just... it's a normal cable. Seems fine.

Agent: Alright. Well, let's try plugging the router back in and see what happens.

Customer: Okay. (background noise) (pause) Plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, so now... I'm seeing the same thing. The green light on the bottom, but still no power light up top. And the Internet light is blinking again.

Agent: (pause) And you're definitely seeing the green light, but not the power light at the top?

Customer: Correct. Just the green light at the bottom and the blinking Internet light.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay, David, I'm wondering if that might actually be a modem light and not a power indicator. Can you describe the router to me a bit more? Is it round, rectangular... what color is it?

Customer: It's white, and it's pretty rectangular. Kind of looks like a small box. There's definitely a power light marked on top left of the unit.

Agent: And that power light is definitely not illuminated at all?

Customer: No, it's completely dark.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) That's... that's unusual because the unit is responding if we're seeing the Internet light blink. Let me check your account history here. (pause) When was the last time you had any service issues?

Customer: I mean, not recently. Internet's been working fine until like an hour ago. I was just using it normally and then suddenly it just dropped.

Agent: Okay. And do you remember if there was a storm or anything? Any power issues in your area?

Customer: (pause) You know, actually, now that you mention it, I think there might have been a power flicker earlier. I'm not totally sure, but I don't think there was a storm or anything.

Agent: That could potentially explain it. Sometimes when there's a power fluctuation, it can damage equipment. The fact that some lights are responding but the power indicator isn't lighting up is a bit concerning. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you unplug the router completely, wait a full minute this time, and then plug it back in?

Customer: Sure. (background noise) Unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, and I'm waiting. (long pause) One minute is up. (background noise of plugging in) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: (pause) Alright, what are we seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Still the same thing. Green light on bottom, blinking Internet light, and no power light on top.

Agent: (pause) Okay. And you're able to see the WiFi network at all on your laptop?

Customer: No, nothing. It's not showing up.

Agent: (pause) Alright, David, I hate to say this, but based on what we're seeing, it sounds like the router itself might be experiencing a hardware failure. The power light not coming on despite power reaching the unit is... that's not a good sign.

Customer: (pause) So what does that mean? Can you like... I don't know, send me a new one?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, so we can definitely look into sending you a replacement unit. Unfortunately, I'm not able to authorize that through troubleshooting alone. You're going to need to speak with our technical support team or customer service, and they can arrange a replacement or potentially a technician visit. Let me get you the right department.

Customer: Okay, but like... how long is that gonna take? I really need this working.

Agent: I understand, I know that's frustrating. Typically, we can get a replacement unit shipped within 2-3 business days, or if you prefer, we can schedule a technician to come out. That might be a bit faster depending on availability.

Customer: Can you just put me through to them?

Agent: Absolutely, let me transfer you over to our customer service department. One moment. (pause) Okay, I'm going to transfer you now.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: Thanks for your patience, David. You'll be connected momentarily.
