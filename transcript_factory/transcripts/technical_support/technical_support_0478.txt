# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, uh, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're on our fiber plan. So your internet is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. Like, nothing. The router's not showing any lights or anything.

Agent: Alright, let's try to troubleshoot this. First, can you tell me if you're looking at your modem or your router? Sometimes people have both units.

Customer: Um... I think I have both? There's a white box and then there's like a separate thing with the antenna sticking up.

Agent: Perfect. So the white box is your modem and the one with the antenna is the router. For now, let's focus on the modem. Can you tell me if there are any lights on it at all?

Customer: No, nothing. It's completely dark.

Agent: Okay, no lights. Can you check if the power cable is securely plugged into the back of the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... it's plugged in. I can see it's connected.

Agent: Good. And is the other end of that cable plugged into the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause) Oh, wait... let me check behind here. (background noise) Yeah, that's plugged in too.

Agent: Alright. What I'd like you to do is unplug the modem from the power outlet, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. This is called a power cycle and it often fixes these kinds of issues.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. I'm gonna count to thirty... thirty seconds. (pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it a minute to boot up. There should be some lights that come on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing... like a blue light now on the modem. And there's some green lights too, I think?

Agent: Excellent. That's normal. Those lights indicate that the modem is powering on and connecting to our network. Give it another 30 seconds or so, and we should see the internet light come on. That's usually one of the main lights.

Customer: (pause) Um... I see the blue light, and like, a couple green ones, but I'm not seeing... is there supposed to be a specific light that says internet?

Agent: Yes, there should be a light labeled "Internet" or sometimes it says "Online." It might also be labeled with a globe or WiFi symbol. Do you see anything like that?

Customer: (pause) I'm looking... there's one that kinda looks like a WiFi symbol, but it's red. Is that bad?

Agent: Oh, the red light. Okay, that indicates there's an issue with the internet connection. Let me check on my end here. (typing sounds) Are you still looking at the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I'm right here.

Agent: Can you try unplugging the modem one more time? I'm going to send a signal to your account that might help reestablish the connection while you do that.

Customer: Sure, unplugging again. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Let it sit for about 30 seconds again.

Customer: (pause) Alright, 30 seconds... plugging back in now.

Agent: Thanks. Now, while that's starting up, can you tell me... did anything change before your internet went out? Like, did you have any recent storms, or did you move equipment around, or anything like that?

Customer: Hmm, there was a thunderstorm last night, actually. Pretty bad one. Could that have... I mean, everything seemed fine this morning.

Agent: That's definitely possible. Lightning strikes or power surges from storms can sometimes damage equipment. But let's see if the modem comes back online first. (pause) Are you seeing those lights again?

Customer: Yeah, they're coming back on. Blue light, green lights, and... (pause) the red WiFi light is still there.

Agent: Still red. Okay. So it looks like we might have a bigger issue here. Do you see a small reset button on the modem? It's usually a tiny hole that you'd need a pen or paperclip to press.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's a little hole here in the back.

Agent: I'm going to have you press and hold that for about 10 seconds. This will reset the modem to factory settings, so we can reconfigure it.

Customer: Okay, so I'm using a paperclip... pressing it... (pause) How long do I hold it?

Agent: Just keep it pressed for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm still holding... (background noise) Alright, I let go.

Agent: Good. Now the modem is going to restart. It might take a few minutes to completely reboot. Can you stay on the line?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: (pause) I'm also looking at your account, and I'm not seeing any service disruptions in your area, so it does seem like this is isolated to your equipment. Let me just verify a few things with you while we wait. How long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, um, maybe about two years?

Agent: And have you had any issues like this before?

Customer: No, nothing. It's always worked pretty well.

Agent: That's good to hear. (typing sounds) Okay, let me check on that modem. Are you seeing any changes?

Customer: (pause) I'm seeing the lights again, but... the internet light is still red.

Agent: Still red. Unfortunately, I think we may be dealing with a hardware issue here. Given what you mentioned about the storm last night, it's possible the modem was damaged by the power surge.

Customer: Oh no, really? So what do I... what do I need to do?

Agent: What I'd recommend is that we send a technician out to your location to assess the situation. They might be able to test the modem and determine if it needs to be replaced, or there might be an issue with the line itself that they can address.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet for work.

Agent: I understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) I'm showing we have availability tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean... I guess that'll have to work. Do I have to be there?

Agent: Yes, someone does need to be home to let the technician in. They'll bring replacement equipment if needed, so you should be back up and running fairly quickly.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, I can do tomorrow afternoon.

Agent: Perfect. Before we book that, let me just try one more thing on my end. I'm going to run a line test to make sure the issue isn't from our side. (pause) This might take a minute.

Customer: Sure, go ahead.

Agent: (pause) Okay, the line test is showing that our network connection on this end is active, but we're not getting a response from your modem. That confirms that the issue is with your equipment, not our network.

Customer: So it's definitely the modem?

Agent: It's very likely. The technician will be able to confirm that tomorrow and get you a replacement if that's the case.

Customer: Alright, I guess that's the best we can do then.

Agent: I apologize that we couldn't get you back online today, but the good news is we'll have someone out to you tomorrow. Can I confirm the address on the account? (pause) I'm showing 447 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, 1 to 5 PM tomorrow works for you?

Customer: Yes, that works.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation call about an hour before the appointment window. Is the phone number we have on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that number's fine.

Agent: Excellent. You're all set. Again, I'm very sorry we couldn't resolve this today, but our technician will absolutely get you taken care of. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we'll get you back online tomorrow. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
