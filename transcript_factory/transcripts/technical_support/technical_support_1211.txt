Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and router but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get the first and last name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got your account here. So you mentioned you already tried unplugging the modem and router. Can you tell me a little more about what you're seeing right now? Like, is the modem powered on?

Customer: Yeah, the modem's on. I can see the lights, but... they're not all lit up like they normally are. Usually there's like a green light that's solid, but right now I'm only seeing like a red light blinking.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. A red blinking light typically indicates a connection issue. Let me ask you a few more things. Are you near the modem right now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm standing right in front of it.

Agent: Great. Can you tell me which lights are on? Is there a power light that's solid?

Customer: Uh, yeah, there's a power light that's on. And then there's... I think it says "Internet" and that one's blinking red.

Agent: Okay, so the Internet light is the one that's red and blinking. That makes sense. And your router—can you tell me if that one has any lights on?

Customer: The router's got some lights on it too. There's a power light and like a WiFi light, but they're both kind of dim. Is that normal?

Agent: (pause) Dim lights could mean a few things. Let me have you try something. Can you unplug the modem for about thirty seconds? While that's unplugged, can you also unplug the router?

Customer: Okay, unplugging now... (pause) ...both are unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Just give it about thirty seconds. In the meantime, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your line here and I'm not seeing any outages in your area, so that's good news.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been about thirty seconds. Should I plug them back in now?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug the modem in first. Let's wait for that to fully boot up before we plug in the router.

Customer: Alright... (pause) ...plugging in the modem. The power light came back on.

Agent: Good. Now let's give it about a minute to fully boot up. While we wait, can you tell me—when did you first notice the internet went out? Was there a storm or anything unusual?

Customer: No storm or anything. It was just... I was working and then suddenly everything just dropped. No warning or anything.

Agent: Hmm, okay. And you haven't had any service issues recently before this?

Customer: No, nothing. It's been pretty reliable, actually.

Agent: (pause) Alright, well that's good. Has it been about a minute now?

Customer: Yeah, probably close to it.

Agent: Okay, now can you plug the router back in?

Customer: (pause) Yep, plugging it in... okay, it's in.

Agent: Great. Give that about a minute as well to boot up. While that's happening, let me just double-check a few things on my end. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I'm showing your account is active, your service is active, and again, no outages on the line. Michael, can you try opening a web browser on your computer or phone and see if you can get internet now?

Customer: (pause) I'm trying... nope, nothing's loading. It's just, like, saying "can't connect to the server" or whatever.

Agent: Okay, let me ask—are you connected to the WiFi? Is the WiFi showing up on your device?

Customer: Oh! Let me check. (pause) Hmm, I don't see the WiFi network showing up at all.

Agent: Is the WiFi light on the router illuminated?

Customer: (pause) No, actually, it's off. The power light is on but the WiFi light is still off.

Agent: Okay, that could mean the router's still booting up. Let's give it another minute or so. While we're waiting, let me ask—is there maybe a button on the back or bottom of the router where you could do a hard reset? Sometimes that helps.

Customer: There might be. Let me look... (pause) Yeah, there's like a little recessed button back here. Do you want me to press it?

Agent: Actually, let's hold off on that for just a second. Let me check your router model first. Can you tell me what kind of router you have? There should be a model number on the back.

Customer: Uh, it says "Frontier Actiontec" something... Actiontec M424WR.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got that. And Michael, just out of curiosity—have you had any recent weather, power outages, or anything like that in the last day or two?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Power's been fine.

Agent: And the router—you said the WiFi light is still off?

Customer: Yeah, still off.

Agent: Okay, let's try that hard reset now. On the M424WR, you'll want to press and hold that recessed button for about ten to fifteen seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... (pause) ...should I let go now?

Agent: How long have you been holding it?

Customer: Maybe like... twelve, thirteen seconds?

Agent: Go ahead and let go.

Customer: (pause) Let go... okay, so now the lights are kind of going crazy, like they're cycling through. Is that normal?

Agent: That's actually normal for a reset. It's rebooting. Give it about two minutes for it to fully come back online.

Customer: Alright, I'll wait. (long pause) Okay, it's been a couple minutes. The power light's back on solid now, but... the WiFi light is still off.

Agent: Still off? (pause) Hmm, that's unusual. Let me have you check something. On the back of the router, is there a switch or toggle labeled WiFi?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... oh, wait. Yeah, actually there is. And it's in the... it's kind of in the off position, I think. Let me switch it.

Agent: Oh! Okay, try that.

Customer: (pause) I flipped it and... okay, now the WiFi light is on! Let me see if I can connect now.

Agent: Great! Go ahead and try connecting to your WiFi network.

Customer: (pause) I'm clicking on my network... okay, it's connecting... (pause) ...it's connecting... (pause) Okay, I'm connected! And let me try loading a website... (pause) Yes! Yes! It's working! It's loading!

Agent: Excellent! That's great news, Michael. So it looks like the WiFi had been turned off on the router. That was a lucky find.

Customer: Oh my God, I can't believe that was it. (laughs) I don't know how that happened. I definitely didn't do that.

Agent: It happens more often than you'd think, honestly. Sometimes it can get switched off during a reset or even accidentally. The good news is you're all set now. Is everything loading properly for you?

Customer: Yeah, it's loading great. Everything looks good. Thank you so much for your help.

Agent: You're very welcome! I'm glad we got you back online. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now.
