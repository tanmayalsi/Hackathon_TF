# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: James Kowalski.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account here. So your service has been down since this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, around 8 AM. I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing was loading. Then I realized the router wasn't showing any lights or anything.

Agent: Okay, let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you seeing any lights on the modem or router at all right now?

Customer: No, nothing. Both are completely dark.

Agent: Alright, the first thing we want to do is make sure everything's powered on. Can you check that both devices are plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, they're both plugged in. I can see them from here.

Agent: Great. Now, can you unplug the modem first? The one that connects directly to the wall outlet, not the router.

Customer: Uh, okay... (sound of movement) ...done.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about 30 seconds and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in... (pause) ...nothing yet.

Agent: That's alright. Sometimes it takes a minute or two to boot back up. While we wait, let me just verify—you're still seeing no lights at all on the modem?

Customer: No lights. It's like completely dead.

Agent: Hmm, okay. (pause) And you mentioned the router is also dark?

Customer: Yeah, same thing.

Agent: Got it. Can you also check the cable coming into your modem? The one from the wall outlet? Is it connected tightly?

Customer: (sound of movement) Yeah, it looks connected to me.

Agent: Okay. Now, this is going to sound a little odd, but I want you to try something. Can you unplug the modem again, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in? But this time, watch it closely to see if you get any lights at all, even if they're just briefly flickering.

Customer: Sure. (pause) Unplugging now... (longer pause) ...okay, plugging it back in. (pause) I'm looking at it... no, still nothing. Completely black.

Agent: Alright. Let me try a different approach. Do you have any other devices that you can plug into that same outlet to see if there's power coming through?

Customer: Um... I could try a lamp or something.

Agent: Yeah, that would be perfect actually.

Customer: (sound of movement, pause) Okay, I plugged in a lamp and it came right on.

Agent: Good, so we know that outlet has power. That tells me the issue might be with the modem itself. Let me just... (pause, typing) ...pull up your service history here. (pause) When was the last time you had any service disruptions or issues?

Customer: Not that I can remember. It's been working fine for the past few months.

Agent: Okay. And has there been any weather in your area? Any storms or anything like that recently?

Customer: No, nothing. It's actually pretty clear today.

Agent: Alright, James. Let me try one more thing. I'm going to have you check the power cable itself. Sometimes these cables can get damaged or the connections can come loose inside. Can you trace the cable from your modem and look at both ends—where it plugs into the modem and where it plugs into the outlet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. The outlet end looks fine. The modem end... it looks okay too, but wait. (pause) Is it supposed to be like... warm?

Agent: Warm? Can you elaborate? Is the modem itself warm to the touch?

Customer: Yeah, actually it's pretty warm. Warmer than I'd expect.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's... that's not a great sign, to be honest. It sounds like there might be an internal issue with the modem. How hot are we talking? Can you keep your hand on it?

Customer: Not really. I can't keep my hand on it for more than a second or two.

Agent: Yeah, don't. I don't want you burning yourself. James, I think what might have happened here is the modem experienced some kind of surge or failure. That warmth usually indicates an internal component issue.

Customer: Oh no, really? So what... what do I do? Can you send me a new one?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. We can definitely get you a replacement modem. Let me just check a few more things to make sure that's the issue and not something on the network side. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm looking at our network status for your area and everything appears to be functioning normally on our end. I'm not seeing any outages.

Customer: So it is the modem then?

Agent: Well, based on what we've found—the fact that there's no power indicator lights, and especially with that heat you're describing—I'm fairly confident that's the issue. However, I do want to be thorough. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check with my technical team to see if there's anything else we can rule out.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (hold music, approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: James? Are you still there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Great. So I spoke with my team and we've gone through the typical troubleshooting steps. Given what we've found, I think a modem replacement is the right call. Unfortunately, I'm unable to get your internet restored today, but I can get you scheduled for a technician visit tomorrow, or we can expedite a replacement modem to you.

Customer: How long would expedited take?

Agent: For an expedited modem, we're typically looking at 1 to 2 business days. For a technician visit, I can get someone out there as early as tomorrow afternoon.

Customer: (pause) Uh, I really need internet. Can you do the technician tomorrow?

Agent: Absolutely, let me check the availability. (typing sounds, pause) I can get a technician scheduled for tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, tomorrow afternoon works.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just get a few details confirmed. Your address is still 447 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. And a phone number they can use to contact you when they're on the way?

Customer: 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so I have you scheduled for tomorrow, December 14th, between 12 and 4 PM. The technician will bring a replacement modem and get everything set up for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I'm sorry, it's just frustrating because I had some work stuff I needed to do online today.

Agent: I completely understand, James. I'm sorry you're dealing with this. The technician tomorrow should have you back up and running in no time. And just to make sure—don't try to plug that modem back in or play around with it, okay? Just leave it unplugged.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I won't touch it.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's everything.

Agent: Alright, James. Thank you for your patience today. We really appreciate it. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with your appointment details. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
