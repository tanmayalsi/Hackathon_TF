Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up and running. I've got a work call in like an hour.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. And your name is... Robert Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Robert. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Just to clarify, you have no internet connection at all right now, correct?

Customer: Right, yeah. Like, nothing. Usually I can at least see the Wi-Fi network pop up on my phone, but there's nothing. The router's just sitting there and it's not doing anything.

Agent: Okay, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First thing I'd like you to do is look at your modem—that's the device where the internet line comes in. Can you tell me what color the lights are on the front?

Customer: Um... (pause) hold on, let me go look at it. (sound of footsteps) It's on the shelf in my bedroom. Okay, so... there's like a power light I think? It's green.

Agent: Good, so power is on. And do you see any lights for internet or online status?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's one that says "internet" on the label and it's... it's red. Is that bad?

Agent: Yeah, that indicates the modem isn't connecting to our network. Before we go further, have you rebooted the modem yet today?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, let's try that. Can you unplug the modem from the power for about thirty seconds?

Customer: Okay. (sounds of unplugging) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we wait, let me ask—did anything happen before the internet went out? Like a power outage or storm last night, or did you change anything with your setup?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I just... I woke up, got some coffee, and realized I had no internet. It was kind of sudden.

Agent: Alright. And has your internet been reliable otherwise? Any issues in the past few months?

Customer: Nope, been working great actually. This is the first time it's gone out since I got it installed like six months ago.

Agent: Good to know. Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. Give it about a minute to boot back up. While that's happening, are you able to see the Wi-Fi network name on your phone or any device?

Customer: (pause) Still waiting... no, not yet. (pause) Oh, wait—I'm starting to see the network name pop up. That's a good sign, right?

Agent: That's definitely a step in the right direction. Now try connecting to it on your phone. What's the password on the back of your router?

Customer: It's... hold on. (sound of rustling) Okay, I got it. (pause) Connecting... and... I'm connected to the network.

Agent: Excellent. Now let's see if you have internet. Can you open a web browser and try to go to any website? Google, Facebook, something like that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm trying... I'm typing in Google... (longer pause) Hmm, it's just... it's loading. Loading. It's been like twenty seconds.

Agent: Sometimes it takes a minute after a reboot. Give it another moment.

Customer: (pause) Still loading. Still loading. Uh... (sighs) Nope, it timed out. It says the page can't be reached.

Agent: Okay, so you're connected to the Wi-Fi but no actual internet traffic is going through. That tells me it's a connection issue between the modem and our network. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Can you look at that modem again and tell me if the internet light is still red?

Customer: Yeah, it's still red. Maybe a little bit more orange now? I don't know.

Agent: Okay. Um, I'm looking at your account and I don't see any outages in your area. Let me try a power cycle on my end. Sometimes that helps reset the connection.

Customer: Okay, sounds good.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I've initiated that. Give it about two minutes, and then we'll check the light again and see if you can get back online.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) So... does this happen often, or am I just unlucky?

Agent: It can happen, but like you said, you've been up and running consistently for six months, so this is unusual for you. Usually when we see this kind of thing, a reboot or a refresh from our end clears it right up. (pause) Why don't you check on that light now?

Customer: Yeah, let me... (pause) ...still red. No change that I can see.

Agent: Alright. Hmm. Let me ask you a couple more questions. Is the cable going from the wall outlet to the modem nice and secure?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean, I see it plugged in. Let me... let me pull on it to make sure. Yeah, it's tight. Feels pretty secure.

Agent: Good. And that cable hasn't been damaged or anything? No tears or anything?

Customer: No, it looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Robert, I want to be honest with you. What we're seeing here is a connection issue that usually responds to basic troubleshooting, but it doesn't seem to be responding right now. I'm not getting the signal from the modem that I'd expect to see.

Customer: Oh. (pause) So what does that mean? Is it broken?

Agent: Not necessarily. It could be a few things—it might be an issue with the modem itself, or it could be something with the line coming to your house. What I'm going to need to do is escalate this to our technical team and get a technician scheduled to come out to your place and do a full diagnostic.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need this working soon. I've got a big presentation tomorrow and I need to prep tonight.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) The earliest we have is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Before noon? Yeah, yeah, that could work. That's cutting it close, but yeah.

Agent: Great. Can I get a callback number for you?

Customer: Same number as my account, 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. I've got that scheduled. Is there anything else you'd like me to try before the technician comes out?

Customer: I don't know... is there anything else we can do? I'd really like to have it working sooner.

Agent: (pause) Well, let me... let me try one more thing. Have you checked if there's a reset button on the modem itself? Sometimes it's a small pinhole button?

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) yeah, I think I see it. It's on the back. Should I press it?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead. You'll need to hold it for about ten seconds. That's going to reset it to factory settings though, so just be aware.

Customer: Okay, holding it... (pause) ...holding... okay, it's resetting. The lights are flashing now.

Agent: [inaudible]... one more minute for it to fully boot up again.

Customer: (pause) Okay. It's... mostly booted. The internet light is still red though.

Agent: Yeah. I was hoping that might do it. (pause) Alright, Robert, I think we're going to need that technician visit. This isn't responding to the standard troubleshooting steps, which usually means there's either a hardware issue or a line issue that we need to look at in person.

Customer: Okay. I guess I don't really have a choice then, huh?

Agent: Unfortunately not on this one. But the technician should be able to get you sorted out pretty quickly tomorrow. If it's a modem issue, we can replace that. If it's the line, they'll check the connection points and get that working.

Customer: Alright. Thanks for trying though. So I'm all set for tomorrow morning?

Agent: You are. The appointment is scheduled for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM, and we have your callback number. The technician will call you before they arrive. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome, Robert. We'll get you back up and running. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
