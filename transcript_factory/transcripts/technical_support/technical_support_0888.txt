Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I need to get this fixed pretty quickly if possible.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And your name?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Uh, I'd say around 9 AM maybe? I was trying to work from home and just... nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Okay. And have you checked to see if your modem and router are powered on? Sometimes they can cycle or lose power.

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I already checked that. Both of them are lit up. The modem's showing some lights and everything, so...

Agent: Good. That's helpful information. Can you tell me which lights are on? Like, is the internet light solid green, blinking, or red?

Customer: (pause) Um, so the power light is solid green. But the internet light... it's red. And it's been red all morning.

Agent: Okay, so a red internet light typically means there's no connection coming into your home. Let me ask you a few questions. Have there been any storms in your area recently? Any outages or construction nearby?

Customer: No, no storms. And I don't think so? I mean, I haven't seen anything. Everything was working fine yesterday.

Agent: Alright. Let's try a quick restart of your modem. Can you do that for me right now? Just unplug it from the power, wait about 30 seconds, and plug it back in.

Customer: Sure, yeah. (sounds of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged. I'm gonna wait... (pause) ... alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it a minute or two to boot back up. While that's happening, let me check if there are any service disruptions or maintenance happening in your area. (typing sounds) What's your service address, James?

Customer: It's 442 Maple Drive. That's in Riverside.

Agent: (typing) 442 Maple Drive, Riverside. (pause) I'm not showing any active outages in your area at the moment. The network looks stable on our end. How's that modem doing now? Has it booted up?

Customer: Yeah, it's... it's booted up, but the internet light is still red. Still red.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Let me try a different approach. Can you check the back of your modem for me? There's usually a small reset button. It's recessed, so you might need something like a paperclip.

Customer: (pause) Oh, okay. Yeah, I see it. You want me to hold it down?

Agent: Yes, but hold it for about 10 seconds. That'll do a complete factory reset. Just a heads up, this will reset your modem to its default settings, so we may need to reprogram some things afterward.

Customer: Alright, holding it down... (pause) ... okay, I've got it.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it another minute to restart. (pause) While we wait, can you tell me if you've had any recent changes to your setup? New router, anything unplugged recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Everything's been the same for like a year now.

Agent: Okay, that's good. And the light, is it still red?

Customer: Yeah, it's still red. It's cycling through stuff right now, I think. Some amber... and now it's back to red.

Agent: (pause) Alright, James. I'm going to be honest with you. The fact that the light isn't turning green after the reset tells me there might be an issue with either the line coming into your house or possibly the modem itself. Let me check something in our system here. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing any recent line issues flagged on your account, but that doesn't necessarily mean there isn't one.

Customer: So like... what does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: It could be, or it could be a line issue. Let me ask you this—do you have a coax cable connected? That's the cable that goes from your wall outlet into the modem?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's... it's connected. I think? Let me just check. Yeah, it's definitely plugged in.

Agent: Good. Can you just verify that the connection is tight? Sometimes they can come loose.

Customer: (pause) It seems pretty tight to me. I'm turning it... yeah, it's not moving.

Agent: Alright. Unfortunately, James, from what I'm seeing here and based on what we've tried, this is likely going to require a technician visit. I'm showing that we can get someone out to your place within the next 24 to 48 hours. Does that work for you?

Customer: Within 24 to 48 hours? I'm working from home, man. I really need this sooner than that.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check if there are any earlier appointments available. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm showing that we might be able to get you in tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM? Would that window work?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, tomorrow works. That's better than the 48 hours. Can I get that scheduled?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to set up that appointment for you tomorrow, between 1 and 5 PM, for a technician to come diagnose the line and modem. The technician will be able to run some tests and either repair the line or replace the modem if needed.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. Do I need to like... prepare anything?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home to let them in. The technician may need access to both your modem and the external connection. Other than that, you should be all set. You'll receive a confirmation email and you can also check your account online for any updates.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything else I should try before they get here?

Agent: [inaudible] ...honestly, I wouldn't recommend trying too much more right now. You've done the main troubleshooting steps. Any other attempts could potentially complicate things for the technician. Just leave it powered on as is.

Customer: Okay, I'll just leave it. Alright, well, I appreciate the help, even though we couldn't fix it today.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone, James. I know it's inconvenient. But our technician should be able to get you back online tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, James. Have a good day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
