Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're in the Westbrook area on our fiber service. And you're saying your internet is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. I tried unplugging the modem and the router, waiting like five minutes, plugging them back in... nothing. The modem's still showing red lights.

Agent: Okay, that's a good troubleshooting step that you already did. Red lights usually indicate a connection issue on our end or with the modem itself. Let me ask you a few questions. Are you seeing any lights on the modem at all?

Customer: Um, yeah. There's like... a red light on the power indicator and then another red light below it.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is red. That's actually... hmm. So the modem is powered on but not getting a signal. Can you check the cable that goes from the wall outlet into the modem? Is it plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me check. (sounds of movement) Yeah, it looks pretty secure. The cable is definitely in there.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm, you're not seeing any yellow or green lights at all?

Customer: No, just the two red ones. That's it.

Agent: Got it. So we're not getting any internet signal to your home at this point. Let me check our systems here to see if there's an outage in your area. (typing sounds) I'm not showing any reported outages in Westbrook currently, but that doesn't mean there isn't an issue with your line specifically. 

Customer: Okay, so what do we do?

Agent: Well, let's try a few more things. Can you locate the battery backup on the modem? It should be a small battery pack attached to the back.

Customer: Uh, yeah, I see it. What do I need to do with it?

Agent: Can you disconnect that battery, and then unplug the modem completely from the power outlet? Leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that now. (pause) Alright, thirty seconds have passed. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug it back in, and reconnect the battery pack.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's plugging back in. (pause) Hmm, still the same red lights.

Agent: Okay. And you're not seeing any lights changing or flickering at all?

Customer: No. Nothing. Just... red. It's just been sitting here showing red lights for the last couple minutes.

Agent: Let me put you on a brief hold while I check something on the technical side. This should only take a moment.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I'm looking at your line here, and I'm actually not seeing a strong signal coming from our node to your address. The issue could be with the line itself, possibly a break somewhere, or it could be a problem at our distribution point.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Like, can you fix it?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, what I'm dealing with here requires a technician to come out to your location and physically inspect the line and the connection points. This isn't something I can resolve over the phone. However, before we schedule that, let me try one more thing. Can you tell me if you've experienced any weather recently? Heavy rain, wind, anything like that?

Customer: Actually, yeah. We had some pretty heavy rain last night and early this morning. Is that... related?

Agent: It could be. Sometimes after heavy weather, lines can get disconnected or water can get into the connection box. Did you notice any water around your modem or the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't think so. Everything looks dry inside.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm one more time, you've tried the restart, you've checked all the cables...

Customer: Yeah, I've done all that.

Agent: Okay, unfortunately, I think we need to get a technician out there to diagnose what's going on with your external line connection. I can schedule you for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have another window at 2 PM to 6 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Can't you come out today? I need internet for work.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day availability right now. I know that's frustrating. Do either of those time windows tomorrow work for you?

Customer: (sighs) I guess 8 to 12 is fine.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get your contact information to confirm the appointment. Is the number we have on file, 555-0147, the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. And your address is 442 Oak Street in Westbrook?

Customer: That's correct.

Agent: Perfect. You're all set for tomorrow morning between 8 AM and 12 PM. A technician will come out and check your line. I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all the details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just... I really needed this to be working today.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved over the phone. The good news is our technicians are really good at getting to the root of these issues, and I'm confident they'll have you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: Yeah, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
