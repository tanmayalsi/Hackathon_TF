Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went out completely. I've got nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm showing an account for... is this Robert Martinez?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Robert. So you're experiencing a complete loss of internet service, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. The modem's not even... well, actually, I don't know. The modem lights are on, I think. Let me check. (pause) Yeah, there are some lights on the front, but I'm not getting any internet on any of my devices.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So the modem is powered on and showing lights. Can you tell me which lights are lit up? Are they green, red, amber?

Customer: Um, there's a power light that's green. And then there's like... I think there's a red light? Or maybe orange? (pause) Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's red.

Agent: Red light on the modem typically indicates an issue with the connection. That's what we're going to troubleshoot. Have you tried power cycling the modem yet?

Customer: Power cycling? You mean like... unplugging it?

Agent: Exactly. Yeah, just unplug it from the power outlet, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. That'll give it a fresh start.

Customer: Okay, let me do that real quick. (pause) It's unplugged. (pause) Alright, waiting... (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) It's booting up... I see the lights coming back on.

Agent: Great. Let's give it about a minute or so to fully boot up and reconnect to the network.

Customer: (pause) Okay... still showing that red light though.

Agent: Still red? Okay. Let's check a couple other things. Can you look at the back of the modem for me? I need you to verify that the coaxial cable—that's the cable that comes from your wall—is firmly connected.

Customer: The coaxial... yeah, I see it. (pause) It looks pretty tight to me. I mean, it's connected.

Agent: Can you try disconnecting it and reconnecting it? Just hand-tighten it?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, disconnecting... and reconnecting. (pause) It's connected.

Agent: Perfect. Let's see if that helps. Do you see any change in the modem lights?

Customer: (pause) No, still... still red.

Agent: Alright. And you mentioned you're not getting connection on any of your devices? No Wi-Fi at all?

Customer: Right, nothing. My phone, my laptop—I can't connect to Wi-Fi, and I don't have an ethernet cable anyway.

Agent: Okay. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any service outages in your area, and your line appears to be active on our system. One more thing I'd like to try—can you locate the reset button on your modem? It's usually a small button that you'd need a paperclip or pin to press.

Customer: A reset button? Um... (pause) I think I see it. It's like, really small, right?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Now I should mention that if you press this, it will reset all the settings on the modem, so you might need to set it back up afterward.

Customer: Oh. Um... I don't really know how to do that though.

Agent: I can walk you through it if we get to that point, but let's try this first. Go ahead and press it for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, pressing it. (pause) It's resetting... the lights are flashing. (pause) Okay, it's done.

Agent: (pause) Let's give it another minute to fully reboot.

Customer: (pause) Alright. (pause) Okay, it's done booting. Still red though.

Agent: (sighs) Still showing red? Okay, Robert, let me... let me check a few things here. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm going to send a signal reset from our end. That might take a moment.

Customer: Okay. (pause) How long will that take?

Agent: Just give it about 30 seconds. (pause) You know what, go ahead and check those lights again in just a moment.

Customer: (pause) Red light's still there.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I'm looking at the line here, and I'm not seeing any issues with the service provisioning on our end. The modem should be communicating with our network, but something isn't connecting properly.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Is there something wrong with the modem?

Agent: It could be. Unfortunately, we can't really diagnose a modem failure over the phone. What I'm seeing is that the modem isn't establishing a connection to our network, which could be a hardware issue with the device itself, or it could be something on the line.

Customer: Can you guys come out and check it?

Agent: (pause) Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) So I can definitely schedule a technician to come out and diagnose the issue. That would typically be... we have an opening tomorrow between 12 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean... is there anything else we can try right now? I really need my internet back.

Agent: I understand, and I wish I had another solution for you immediately. But given that we've done the power cycle, reseated the cable, reset the modem, and I've sent a signal from our end with no change, the issue is likely hardware-related at this point. A technician would need to come out to either repair or replace the equipment.

Customer: (frustrated) I can't believe this. I work from home half the time.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. The technician can definitely get this taken care of for you quickly. Do you want me to go ahead and schedule that appointment for tomorrow?

Customer: Yeah, I guess. I mean, what else can I do, right?

Agent: Let me set that up for you. (typing sounds) Okay, Robert, I have you scheduled for tomorrow, December 14th, between 12 and 5 PM. A technician will come out to your address on file and diagnose the issue. Is there anything else I can help you with tonight?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just hope this gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sure it will be. And if you do happen to try anything else before the technician arrives and something changes, feel free to give us a call back. But otherwise, we'll see you tomorrow. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, Robert.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: Have a good night.
