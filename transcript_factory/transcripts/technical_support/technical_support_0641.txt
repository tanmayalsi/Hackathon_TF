# Frontier Communications - Technical Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications technical support. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Marcus. My internet's been down since this morning and I'm really frustrated because I have work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account and we can get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. And before you ask, yes, I've already tried unplugging everything and plugging it back in.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. Got your account here. Let me see... I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. And you've already done the basic restart, which is helpful. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is there any light on your modem at all?

Customer: Um, yeah, there's like... the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light, I think it's supposed to be blue or something? It's not lighting up at all. It's just off.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The internet light being off typically means the modem isn't syncing with our network. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Do you see the router separate from the modem, or is it all one unit?

Customer: No, it's two separate pieces. The modem is the one that's not showing the light, and then I have the router next to it.

Agent: Perfect. And what color lights are showing on the router?

Customer: Um, hold on. (pause) Okay, so the power light is on, but everything else is kind of... off or dim. I'm not really sure.

Agent: No problem. Let's try a few things. First, I need you to locate the reset button on the modem. It should be a small recessed button, usually on the back. Do you see it?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. There's like a tiny hole here with a little button inside it?

Agent: That's the one. Before we do anything with that, let me ask... when did the internet go down? Did it happen suddenly, or did it gradually stop working?

Customer: This morning, I think around 8 or 9 AM. I was working and just suddenly nothing. No warning or anything.

Agent: Okay. And have you had any recent power outages in your area, or bad weather?

Customer: No, actually it's been clear all morning. No storms or anything like that.

Agent: Alright. Let's try unplugging the modem for a full 30 seconds this time. That's different from just a quick reset. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) How long again?

Agent: 30 seconds should do it. While we're waiting, I'm going to check if there are any outages reported in your area on our end. (typing sounds)

Customer: (pause) Is it... should I plug it back in yet?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and plug it back in now. Give it about two to three minutes to fully boot up. Just let me know once all the lights come back.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged it back in. The power light is coming back on... (longer pause) Alright, power's green again, but the internet light... still nothing. Still not coming on.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any outages in your area on my end, which is... hmm. Let me try something else. Can you check the cable connection on the back of the modem? There should be a cable coming from your wall outlet going into the modem. Can you just verify that's plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... it looks pretty secure. It's got the little twist connection.

Agent: Good. And just to make sure, is that the coaxial cable? It's like a thick cable with a metal connector?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I'm looking at it now.

Agent: Okay. Try unplugging that cable from the modem, wait about 5 seconds, and then plug it back in and make sure it's tight.

Customer: (pause) Alright, unplugging it... okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Still nothing. The internet light is still off.

Agent: (typing sounds) I'm seeing your modem is registered on our network, which is interesting because usually if we can see the modem online, we'd get some indication... Let me check something here. (pause) Hmm, it's showing as registered but not actively connected. That's unusual.

Customer: So that's bad?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be a problem with the modem itself, or it could be something with the line coming into your house. Let me try one more thing. Can you look at the modem and see if there are any other cables? Sometimes there's an Ethernet cable or—

Customer: Oh, wait. There's like a little red light that just came on. The internet light is now red. Is that better or worse?

Agent: (pause) Actually, that's... that could be a signal issue. A red internet light usually means the modem is detecting the signal but can't sync properly. Have you noticed anything else different? Like, did you recently do any work outside, or did anything change with your setup?

Customer: No, nothing changed. Everything's been the same.

Agent: Alright, let me try resetting the modem to factory settings. I'm going to have you hold that recessed reset button for about 15 seconds. But I have to let you know, this will erase any custom settings you've made, so—

Customer: [inaudible] Just do it. I need my internet back.

Agent: Okay, go ahead. Hold that button down for about 15 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Holding it... (longer pause) Okay, I held it for like 20 seconds. The modem is rebooting.

Agent: Good. Let's give this about three to five minutes for it to fully reset and reboot. This is normal—it'll take a little while. While we wait, do you have a mobile phone I can reach you on in case we get disconnected?

Customer: Yeah, it's the same number on the account.

Agent: Perfect. So we're just gonna wait here for the modem to finish. (pause) How long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, um, about two years I think? We switched from the cable company because of your fiber speeds.

Agent: Nice. Okay, you should be seeing the modem do a full boot-up sequence now—all the lights should cycle through.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see lights flashing and... okay, power light is steady green. Internet light is coming on... it's amber right now. (pause) Okay, now it's... it's still amber. Not blue.

Agent: (pause) Okay, amber light means it's still trying to establish a connection but hasn't succeeded yet. Sometimes this takes a minute or two. Let's give it another minute.

Customer: (pause) Still amber.

Agent: (pause) Still amber?

Customer: Yeah. And it's been like... it's been like two minutes now.

Agent: (sigh) Okay. This should have moved past that point by now. (typing sounds) I'm going to be honest with you—at this point, this is looking less like a software issue and more like either a modem hardware failure or a problem with the fiber line coming into your home. 

Customer: So what does that mean? How long to fix it?

Agent: Well, I can definitely get a technician scheduled to come out and assess what's going on. But given that you're down right now and it's already afternoon... the soonest we might have availability is tomorrow. Let me check our schedule. (typing sounds)

Customer: Tomorrow? I need internet today. I have meetings.

Agent: I completely understand, and I wish I could get someone out there today, but let me just see what we have... (pause) Unfortunately, our technician schedule is pretty full for today. The earliest we can get someone is tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: I guess it has to. But this isn't great. I pay for your service and I need it to work.

Agent: I hear you, and I'm really sorry about this situation. If this turns out to be on our end—the fiber line or an issue with our network infrastructure—we'll make sure to credit your account for the downtime. And if the technician can't get out tomorrow, we'll definitely prioritize you for the next available slot.

Customer: (pause) Okay, fine. Tomorrow between 12 and 4.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. And just to recap, there's really nothing else I can do on a troubleshooting level. The reset we did was really the last step, and since that didn't resolve it, it's definitely a hardware or line issue that needs hands-on inspection.

Customer: I understand. I'm just... I'm frustrated.

Agent: That's completely fair. You should receive a confirmation text and email about tomorrow's appointment. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: Absolutely. And again, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. If you run into any other issues before the technician arrives, feel free to give us a call back. The appointment is confirmed for tomorrow, 12 to 4 PM. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll get you back online soon.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye.

Customer: Bye.
