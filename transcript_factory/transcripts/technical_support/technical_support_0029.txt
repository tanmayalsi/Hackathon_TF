# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, let me pull that up here. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I'm seeing your account here. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, there's no internet at all. The modem's been on the whole time, and nothing's working.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what color the lights are on your modem right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) There's a green light on the front, but like... I think there's an orange light too? Maybe? I'm not super close to it right now.

Agent: No problem. Can you walk over and take a closer look for me?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, one second. (footsteps) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. The power light is green, that's solid. But the internet light, I think that's the orange one... it's blinking. Like, it keeps blinking.

Agent: Okay, so the power is solid green, and the internet light is orange and blinking. That typically indicates the modem is trying to connect to our network but hasn't established a stable connection yet. Let's try a restart. Can you unplug the modem for me, please?

Customer: Right now?

Agent: Yes, please. Just unplug it from the wall outlet.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I'm going to have you leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds while it powers down completely. I'll wait right here with you.

Customer: Alright. (background noise of waiting)

Agent: Still there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here. This is... this is taking forever. (nervous laugh)

Agent: I know it's frustrating. We're almost there. Go ahead and count to about 30 in your head, or I can count with you if you'd like.

Customer: No, I got it. (pause) Okay, 30 seconds should be up.

Agent: Perfect. Now plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause, sound of plugging in) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Excellent. Now we're going to wait for it to boot back up. That usually takes about two to three minutes. While that's happening, can you tell me—have there been any storms in your area recently? Or any changes to your setup?

Customer: Um, no storms that I know of. But actually, my neighbor was doing some work outside yesterday. I think he was working on his driveway or something. Could that have affected it?

Agent: It's possible, but typically our lines are pretty well protected. It's worth noting though. Let me ask you this—do you see any physical damage to any cables outside your home, or anything that looks out of place?

Customer: I... I don't know. I haven't really looked. Should I go check?

Agent: That would be helpful if you don't mind. But let's see first if the modem has finished rebooting. What are the lights looking like now?

Customer: (pause) Um, still mostly the same. The power is green, but the internet light is... still orange and blinking.

Agent: Still blinking, okay. Let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm running a line test here. (pause) Michael, I'm not seeing a strong signal coming through on this end. That could mean there's an issue with the line itself. Do you have a gateway unit, or just the modem?

Customer: I think it's... just the modem? It's the white box that Frontier installed.

Agent: Right, that should be fine. (pause) Okay, so I'm going to try a few more things here. Can you check all the cables connected to your modem? I want to make sure everything is snug and properly connected.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, there's like, three cables in the back. The power one, obviously, and then there's like two other ones.

Agent: Perfect. One should be your internet line coming in from outside, and the other is typically an ethernet cable if you have anything plugged directly into the modem. Can you wiggle those two carefully and just make sure they're pushed in all the way?

Customer: Okay, so... (sounds of fumbling) This one feels pretty tight already, but let me... (pause) Okay, I pushed both of them in more. Did that do anything on your end?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me run that line test again. (longer pause) Hmm, I'm still getting the same reading. Michael, I think what might be happening here is there could be a service interruption on our network in your area, or there's a problem with the line running to your house. Since you mentioned your neighbor was doing work outside, it's possible that line got disrupted.

Customer: So what do I do?

Agent: Well, let me check something. Are you still seeing that orange blinking light on the modem?

Customer: Yeah, it's been like that for the whole time we've been on the phone.

Agent: Okay. And you've had Frontier service for how long now?

Customer: I'd say... two years? Maybe a little less.

Agent: And this is the first time you've experienced an outage?

Customer: Yeah, first time.

Agent: Alright. I've done about everything I can do on my end, and the issue appears to be on the line side rather than with your modem itself. Normally I would schedule a technician to come out and assess the situation, especially given the work your neighbor was doing. However, due to current demand, the earliest we could get someone out there would be... (typing sounds, pause) ...Wednesday. That's two days from now.

Customer: Wednesday? (frustrated) I need internet before that. I work from home sometimes. Can't they come out sooner?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Michael. Let me check if there are any emergency appointments available. (longer pause) Unfortunately, I'm not seeing anything available until Wednesday morning, between 8 AM and 5 PM. I apologize for that.

Customer: This is really not ideal. Is there anything else you can try? Like, can you reset it remotely or something?

Agent: I actually did run a remote reset when we were troubleshooting, but given that the modem isn't fully connecting to the network, I'm limited in what I can do remotely. At this point, I believe the issue is physical—either with the line coming into your home or potentially at an external junction point. A technician will need to investigate that.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I mean... Wednesday morning. Can you make sure they call before they come?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll add a note to your account that they should call 15 minutes before arrival. And in the meantime, if your internet does come back on its own, you can always cancel the appointment by calling us back. But if I'm being honest, I don't think it will without some physical intervention.

Customer: Alright, alright. What's my confirmation number or whatever?

Agent: (typing sounds) Your service appointment confirmation number is 847-392-FCI. That's F-C-I. And I've already sent a confirmation email to the address on file. You should receive that within the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay, I got that. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Just... to see if it comes back on?

Agent: You can try another reboot if you'd like, but honestly, I'd recommend just leaving it as is at this point. If it miraculously comes back online before Wednesday, great. If not, the technician will take care of it. And Michael, I'm genuinely sorry we weren't able to get this resolved over the phone today.

Customer: Yeah, I understand. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help clarify about your appointment or account?

Customer: No, that's all I got. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your patience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
