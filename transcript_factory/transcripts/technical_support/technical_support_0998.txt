# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, um... I'm calling because my internet just stopped working like an hour ago. I've got nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. Can I also get the name on the account?

Customer: That's under James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see you here. I'm showing you're on our Fiber 200 plan. And you're saying you have no internet connection right now?

Customer: Right, nothing. The modem's on, the lights are on, but I'm not getting anything on my devices.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me ask you a few questions. When this happened, did you notice anything unusual? Any storms in your area, or did anything change with your setup?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine this morning, and then around... I don't know, maybe three o'clock, it just went out. I haven't touched anything.

Agent: Alright. So the modem is powered on—can you tell me which lights are lit up on the front of it? There should be a power light, internet light, maybe a Wi-Fi light...

Customer: Um, yeah. So the power light is on. The... there's like a green light in the middle that's on. But there's another one that's kind of blinking red.

Agent: Okay, the red light that's blinking—that's typically the internet light. That usually means there's no signal coming in from the line. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull it out of the wall.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, doing it now.

Agent: Great. Let's leave that unplugged for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Still unplugged.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Good. Now let's give it a minute or so to boot back up. While that's happening, I'm going to check our service map on your address. Can you hold for just one second?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm back. I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, so that's good news. How's that modem looking now?

Customer: Um... the power light is still green, but that red one is still blinking. It's not solid or anything.

Agent: Yeah, so it's still blinking red. Okay. Let me have you try a couple more things. Can you check the cables for me? There should be a cable coming into the modem from the wall. Can you make sure that's plugged in snugly on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me... okay, I'm looking at it. There's a cable here coming from the wall. It looks... I mean, it looks pretty connected to me, but let me just... (pause) I'm pushing on it a little bit. Does that help?

Agent: Did the light change at all?

Customer: No, still blinking red.

Agent: Okay. Let me try accessing your modem's settings directly. What's the model of your modem? It should be printed on a sticker on the bottom or the back.

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) Let me flip it over. It says... FXG7-4... no wait, FXG7-401.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to have you open a browser on your computer or phone—whichever you have handy—and type in 192.168.100.1. That should take you to the modem settings page.

Customer: Alright, um... I'm doing that now. (pause) Okay, I'm getting a page... it says something about "connecting to device." Is that normal?

Agent: That's normal. Go ahead and wait for that to load.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's loading... (pause) Alright, I'm in. I see a bunch of information. Lots of numbers and stuff.

Agent: Great. Can you tell me what it says under "System Status"? Should be somewhere near the top.

Customer: Um... okay, I see "System Status." It says... "Provisioning Failed."

Agent: (pause) Okay, that right there tells me that there's an issue with the signal coming in from the line. That blinking red light makes sense now. The modem isn't able to establish a connection with our network.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it something I did?

Agent: No, no, this isn't on your end. This is a signal issue from the line coming into your home. Usually this can mean a few things—it could be a problem with the line itself, a damaged connection at the pole, or something at our end. This is something we'd need a technician to come out and check.

Customer: Oh man, really? How long would that take?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I can get a technician out to you tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have a slot on Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: (sigh) Tomorrow morning, I guess. I work from home, so... this is kind of a pain, but yeah, tomorrow works.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, I've got a technician appointment confirmed for tomorrow, May 15th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. You'll get a courtesy call about an hour before they arrive.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything else I can try in the meantime? Any chance this might just fix itself?

Agent: Well, I don't want to get your hopes up too much, but you can leave the modem unplugged overnight and try again in the morning before the technician arrives. Sometimes that can help, but given the "Provisioning Failed" message, I'd be surprised if it resolves on its own. The technician will definitely be able to get to the root of it.

Customer: Alright. And do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home tomorrow during that window. The technician will need access to where the line comes into your house. That's usually near your main electrical panel or wherever you see cables entering the home.

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here. Thank you, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm sorry we weren't able to get this resolved over the phone, but the technician will take good care of you tomorrow. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
