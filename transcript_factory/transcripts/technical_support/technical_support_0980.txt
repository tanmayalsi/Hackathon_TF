# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that can be, especially when you're trying to work. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847. That's the phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me just... there we go. I've got you here. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. The modem's on, it's got power, but I'm not getting any internet connection at all. No Wi-Fi, nothing.

Agent: Alright, let's run through some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me—is your modem showing any lights at all? Look at the front panel.

Customer: Um, yeah. So there's a power light, that's green. And there's... let me see... there's like a red light that says "internet" on it.

Agent: Okay, so the internet light is red. That's helpful information. And do you see any other lights? Like, is there anything blinking or solid on the modem?

Customer: There's a couple other lights but they're all just kind of dim or off. The internet one is definitely the bright red one that stands out.

Agent: Perfect. So that red internet light typically indicates that the modem isn't receiving a signal from our network. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to look at your service status. (pause) Okay, so I'm not showing any outages in your area right now. It looks like your account is active and everything should be working on our end.

Customer: Hmm, so what does that mean? Is it the modem?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. Let me have you try some basic steps first. Can you locate the power cable for your modem?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

Agent: Great. I'm going to have you unplug it, and then we'll wait about 30 seconds. This helps reset the modem's connection to our network.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. While we're waiting, is this the modem we provided to you, or did you buy your own?

Customer: No, it's yours. It came with the service when I signed up like... I don't know, two years ago maybe?

Agent: Okay, good to know. Alright, it's been about 30 seconds. Go ahead and plug that back in for me.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in cord) Okay, plugged back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it a minute or so to boot back up. While it's doing that, can you also check the cable that connects to your modem? The one coming from the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm checking it. It looks... it looks pretty secure actually. It's plugged in tight.

Agent: Excellent. And you don't see any visible damage to it or anything?

Customer: No, looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay. So what we're looking for is for that internet light to change from red to either green or maybe it'll blink green for a bit. Is it still red?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's still red. Maybe a little bit more orange now? But definitely not green.

Agent: Okay, it can take a minute or two. Let's give it a few more seconds. (pause) Has anything changed in the last minute or so? Any of the lights?

Customer: No... no, same thing. Still that orange-red color.

Agent: Alright, let me try something else. Can you check the coaxial cable—that's the one that connects from the wall to your modem? I just want to make sure both ends are screwed on pretty tight.

Customer: (pause, sound of cord being moved) Yeah, the one on the back of the modem feels tight. And... (pause) ...the one at the wall feels pretty secure too. Like, I'm not like, super yanking on it, but they're definitely not loose.

Agent: Okay, that's good. At this point, I'm wondering if maybe there's an issue with the line coming into your house or perhaps the modem itself. Have you experienced any outages recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, first time. It's worked fine until this morning. I went to make coffee, came back, and boom—nothing. It was working fine last night.

Agent: Hmm, that's interesting. Let me check our system one more time to see if there were any brief outages this morning that might have... (typing sounds) ...actually, let me check the line status for your address. (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any red flags on the network side. This really does point to either a connectivity issue at your location or possibly the modem itself.

Customer: So, like... what do I do? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: Well, before we go there, let me have you try one more thing. Sometimes the issue can be with the outlet itself or the splitter if you have one. Do you have a cable splitter on the line coming into your house?

Customer: Um... I don't think so? What does that look like?

Agent: It's usually a small metal device that has one cable coming in and then splits into two or more cables going out. Is there anything like that near your modem?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't see anything like that. It's just the one cable coming out of the wall into the modem.

Agent: Alright, good. Um... (pause) Let me think about this for a second. Can you try powering down the modem one more time? But this time, leave it unplugged for a full two minutes. Sometimes if there's a firmware issue, a longer reset can help.

Customer: (sigh) Sure, I'll try it. You know, I'm supposed to be on a conference call in like fifteen minutes, so...

Agent: I understand. I'll do my best to get you back up and running. Let me just... two minutes, and then we'll plug it back in.

Customer: (pause, background noise of the customer doing other things) Okay, it's been a couple minutes.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in again.

Customer: (plugging sound) Okay, plugged in.

Agent: Let's see... (pause) ...same lights?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, same thing. The internet light is still red. This is... this is not good timing.

Agent: I hear you. Okay, so we've done some basic troubleshooting and the modem isn't connecting to our network. At this point, I have a couple of options. I can schedule a technician to come out to your house—they'd be able to check the line quality and potentially replace the modem if needed. Or... (pause) ...well, that's really the best option I have for you right now.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) So I'm looking at our schedule, and the earliest I can get someone out would be... tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Or we have an afternoon slot around 1 to 5 PM if that's better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I need internet today. I'm working from home.

Agent: I completely understand how urgent this is. Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day appointments available, but I can mark this as a priority call. The technician tomorrow will make sure to get you taken care of first thing.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Okay, well... I guess I'll have to go to a coffee shop or something. That's really frustrating. Can you at least guarantee the modem's the problem?

Agent: Honestly, I can't say for certain without having a tech on-site, but all of our standard troubleshooting steps point to either the modem or potentially a line issue on our end. Either way, the technician will be able to diagnose it properly.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Schedule the morning slot. The 8 to 12 thing.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, so I've got you down for tomorrow, December 14th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. A technician will come out and address this issue. You should receive a confirmation text at... (pause) ...at 555-0847, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just so you know, if a technician needs to replace your modem, that'll be covered since you're renting it from us. There's no charge for that.

Customer: Okay, I guess that's something at least.

Agent: I really do apologize that we can't get this resolved today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I don't think so. Just... try to make sure he comes early tomorrow?

Agent: I'll make a note here that this is time-sensitive for you. The technician will see that. Is there a best number to reach you at if they need to contact you before they arrive?

Customer: No, 555-0847 is fine.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for your patience today, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. We'll get you back online tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. Thank you for calling Frontier.
