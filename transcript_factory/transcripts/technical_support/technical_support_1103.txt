Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. So your service is down completely right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely. I've got no connection at all. The modem's just... it's not doing anything. Well, it's got some lights on it, but nothing's working.

Agent: Alright, let's get you back online. First, let me ask you a few quick questions. When you say the lights are on, what color are they? Are they green, red, or...?

Customer: Um, they're red. They're all kind of red or orange, I think.

Agent: Okay, so they're not the normal green we'd want to see. Have you tried unplugging the modem yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Go ahead and unplug it for me, and let's just wait about thirty seconds. Just give it a little reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Just... let's count to thirty here. While we're doing that, have there been any storms in your area recently? Any power outages or anything?

Customer: No, no storms. The power's been fine. I work from home, so it's definitely been working fine until this morning.

Agent: Gotcha. That's helpful information. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's plugging back in. (pause) Okay, so it's... it's still doing the same thing. The lights are still that orange-red color.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check something on our end here. (typing sounds) Let me see if there are any service interruptions in your area... No, everything looks normal on the network side. Do you have any other devices connected to the modem right now, like a computer or phone or anything?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my laptop connected via WiFi, but nothing's working. Nothing's connecting.

Agent: Right, so the WiFi network isn't showing up, or it's showing up but not connecting?

Customer: It's showing up, actually. My network's there, but when I try to connect, it just says "can't connect to this network" or something like that.

Agent: Okay, that's actually useful. So the modem's broadcasting the WiFi signal. Let me have you try something. Can you unplug the modem's power cable again, but this time, also unplug the white coaxial cable that goes into the back of the modem? The cable from the wall?

Customer: The white... yeah, I see it. (pause) Okay, both unplugged.

Agent: Great. And while they're unplugged, can you also do a hard reset on your modem? There should be a small reset button on the back. You'll need something like a paperclip to press it.

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) Let me find a paperclip. (pause, background noise of drawers opening) Okay, I found one. (pause) Alright, I'm pressing it.

Agent: Perfect. Hold that for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it. (pause) Got it.

Agent: Good. Now let everything sit for about a minute, and then we'll plug the coax cable back in first, and then the power.

Customer: Alright, just waiting... (long pause) Okay, it's been about a minute.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and plug the coax cable back in.

Customer: (pause) Got it. It's in.

Agent: And now plug the power back in.

Customer: (pause) Power's back in. (pause) Okay, so now... the lights are... one of them's blinking now. That's different. (pause) Oh, it's green now. Is that good?

Agent: That's actually great! The green light is what we want to see. Just give it a minute or two to fully boot up and establish the connection. That blinking usually means it's syncing.

Customer: (pause) Okay, okay. Yeah, the lights are stabilizing now. They're all green. That's good, right?

Agent: That's excellent. So let me ask you, are you seeing any internet connection on your laptop yet?

Customer: (pause) Hmm, let me check. I'm looking... no, actually it's still saying "can't connect." The network's there, but... it's still not connecting.

Agent: Okay, let me try something else. Let's restart your laptop while the modem finishes booting up. Have you got a minute to do that?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause, background noise) Restarting now. (long pause) Okay, it's restarting. (pause) It's back on. (pause) Nope, still not connecting. Still the same error.

Agent: Alright, um... (pause) Let me check the modem one more time. Can you tell me what the lights look like right now? Are they all solid green?

Customer: Yeah, all solid green. They look normal now.

Agent: Okay, that's good. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing any connection issues on our end. Let me ask you this—when you try to connect to the WiFi, does it ask you for a password?

Customer: No, it just immediately rejects it. It's not even getting to the password part.

Agent: That's... that's actually unusual. Okay, let me try one more thing. Can you look on the back of the modem and read me the MAC address? It should say "MAC" and then have a long string of letters and numbers.

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's... (reads slowly) F4-2E-7B-9C-D1-3A.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, hold on. (pause, typing) Hmm, so I'm showing that the modem is connected on our end and it registered about... five minutes ago. It is showing as online. But let me check the logs here... (pause) Oh, I'm actually seeing some errors here. It looks like the modem is losing its connection periodically.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be a bad coax connection, or potentially a problem with the modem itself. When did you get that modem?

Customer: I don't know, maybe... two years ago? It came with the service when I signed up.

Agent: Okay. (pause) You know, I think we might need to schedule a technician visit. There could be a hardware issue with the modem, or there could be something on the line side that's causing the dropouts.

Customer: Wait, you can't just... I don't know, replace it remotely or send me a new one or something?

Agent: Unfortunately, with the errors I'm seeing, I'd really recommend having a technician come out and check the connection. I don't want to send you a modem if the problem's on the line. But I can absolutely send you a new modem if the tech determines that's the issue. How does your schedule look? We have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM, or we could do Wednesday.

Customer: I'm home today through Wednesday. Can't you just send someone today?

Agent: Let me check... (typing sounds, pause) Unfortunately, we're all booked for today. But I can get someone out there tomorrow. Does afternoon work better than morning?

Customer: I guess tomorrow afternoon would be okay. But I'm not going to have internet until then?

Agent: I'm afraid not—at least, not until we figure out what's causing this. I wish I could get you back online remotely, but with the intermittent connection issue... I don't want to make it worse.

Customer: (sigh) This is really frustrating. I work from home, and I need internet to do my job.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm really sorry about this. Our tech team will be able to get you sorted out tomorrow. In the meantime, is there anything else I can try?

Customer: No, I guess not. When tomorrow?

Agent: So I'm looking at a window between 1 PM and 5 PM tomorrow. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. You should get a confirmation call or text about two hours before they arrive.

Customer: Okay, fine. Can you at least give me a reference number or something?

Agent: Absolutely. Your ticket number is 847523. I'm also going to add a note that you work from home and this is urgent. Make sure to keep that number handy.

Customer: Okay, I've got it. 847523.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, I really apologize again for the inconvenience. A technician will be out there tomorrow afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. If you have any questions before then, you can always call back and reference that ticket number. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a good day.
