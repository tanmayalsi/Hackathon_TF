Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got work stuff I need to do and it's... it's kind of urgent.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's the same as my service. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And just to confirm, this is for your residential service at... 2847 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Is your modem powered on right now? Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Yeah, the modem's on. I can see... there's a couple lights blinking but they're not the usual colors. Normally they're green, but right now it looks more like orange or red or something.

Agent: Okay, okay. That actually tells us something. The red or orange usually means there's a connection issue. Let me walk you through a quick troubleshoot here. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull it from the wall.

Customer: Sure, one second. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and wait about 30 seconds while it powers down completely.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm waiting.

Agent: Alright, and while we wait, have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. The internet's been pretty solid actually. And it was working fine this morning when I left for work, so... something just happened.

Agent: Right, right. Okay, 30 seconds should be up. Go ahead and plug that modem back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged back in. (pause) It's booting up... lights are coming on. Let me wait for it to stabilize. (pause) Okay, so now I'm seeing... still kind of that orange color on some of the lights. Not all green like it usually is.

Agent: Hmm. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your service address, and I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area. That's good news and bad news, right? Good that it's not a widespread thing, but we need to figure out what's going on with your specific line.

Customer: Yeah, I mean... what do I do?

Agent: Okay, so let's try a few more things. Can you tell me, do you have a separate router, or is your modem and router combined?

Customer: I have a separate router. It's like a white box, Netgear I think.

Agent: Okay, perfect. Is that powered on as well?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. The lights are doing their thing, but I'm not... I'm not getting any WiFi signal. Usually my phone picks it up automatically.

Agent: Alright. Let me have you check the ethernet connection between your modem and your router. Can you see the cable that's plugged into the back of your modem?

Customer: Yeah, I can see it. Hold on, let me get closer. (pause) Okay, it's definitely plugged in. Both ends look tight.

Agent: Good. Try unplugging it and plugging it back in for me. Sometimes these connections can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay... unplugging it... (pause) and plugging it back in. Still the same thing though. Still seeing that orange light situation.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your account and everything should be provisioned correctly on my end. Let me just... (typing sounds) Let me run a quick line test here to see if we're getting a signal to your location. (pause) Okay, so I am detecting a signal, but it's... it's pretty weak actually. It's intermittent. That could indicate a few things—it could be a problem with the line coming into your house, or it could be an issue with the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, so here's what I want to try. I'm going to send a reset command to your modem, and that should reboot it on our end. This might take about three to five minutes. You might see the lights go crazy for a second.

Customer: Okay, go ahead.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I've sent the command. Go ahead and just watch your modem for a minute here.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, the lights are... they're doing a thing. They're like flickering all over the place. (pause) Okay, it's settling down now... (pause) and now... still orange.

Agent: Still orange. Alright. (pause) Okay, unfortunately we're still not getting a strong signal from our end. So at this point, I think we might be dealing with either a line issue or a hardware failure. The next step would really be to get a technician out to your location to check the physical line and possibly replace the modem.

Customer: How long would that take? Like I said, I really need this working soon.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability for you. (typing sounds) (pause) So I'm looking at our next available appointment window and... it looks like we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I kind of need it today.

Agent: I totally get that. Let me see if there's anything in our emergency queue. (pause) Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day appointments available. I know that's not ideal. Is there any chance you could do the morning tomorrow?

Customer: (sighs) I guess I have to, right? I mean, what else am I gonna do?

Agent: I really wish I had a better option for you. But this signal issue is beyond what we can troubleshoot over the phone. A technician will be able to come out and check everything physically.

Customer: Alright, fine. Tomorrow morning. What time should I be here?

Agent: So you'll have an eight AM to 12 PM window. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive so you know exactly when they're pulling up. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just confirm the best number to reach you. Is 555-0147 still the best number?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell. That's fine.

Agent: Great. And just to recap, we have a technician scheduled to visit your location tomorrow, Saturday, between 8 AM and 12 PM to diagnose and repair your internet service. You should expect a call about 30 minutes before arrival.

Customer: Got it.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just... I really hope this gets fixed.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. Our technician is very experienced and they'll get you back online as quickly as possible. You should be all set by tomorrow afternoon at the latest.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your patience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
