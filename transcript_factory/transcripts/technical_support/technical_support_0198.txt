Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I've got no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed—I've got work to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you troubleshoot this. First, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's area code 417, 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, that's the service address in Springfield?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Alright, I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your account here. It shows you have our Fiber 500 plan. Can you tell me what you're experiencing right now? Is there any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Well, that's the thing—the modem looks dead. Like, completely. There's no lights or anything. It's just... dark.

Agent: Okay, that could be a few things. Let's start with the basics. Can you check if the power cable is firmly connected to the modem? Sometimes it can come loose.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, let me... okay, so I'm looking at it now and... actually, wait. The cord's plugged in, but I don't think I see... hold on. (pause) No, yeah, the plug is definitely in the outlet. I checked.

Agent: Good. And the outlet itself—is there anything else plugged into it? Like a lamp or anything? Can you try plugging something else in there to see if the outlet has power?

Customer: (background noise, rustling) Okay, um... I'm gonna plug in my phone charger. (pause) Yeah, the charger light came on, so the outlet's working fine.

Agent: Great, so the outlet has power. Now, the modem cable—let me make sure we're looking at the right one. There's usually a power brick or adapter. Can you trace the cable from the modem back to the wall outlet and make sure it's not damaged or anything?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. The cable looks... it looks fine to me. No cuts or anything weird.

Agent: Okay, good. Let's try unplugging it completely. Just disconnect the power cable from the modem, and then wait about 30 seconds. We'll do a hard reset.

Customer: Alright. (pause) It's unplugged. I'm counting... okay, should be 30 seconds by now.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Done. (pause) Uh... still nothing. No lights coming on at all.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let's check a couple other things. Is there a battery backup unit or anything connected to the modem? Sometimes there's an UPS device?

Customer: No, it's just... it's just plugged straight into the wall. It's a pretty simple setup.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright. Can you describe the modem for me? What's the model? There should be a label on the top or back of it.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it... it says Frontier... and then... FX-12? I think? It's hard to read.

Agent: Okay, FX-12. That sounds about right. (pause) Can you check—and this might sound silly—but is there a power button on the modem? Sometimes it's on the back or side, and it might have gotten switched off somehow.

Customer: Oh! (laughs) Let me check. I'm looking at the back... no, I don't see... wait, actually there's a little button here on the side. Is that—? Should I push it?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and try pressing it for a few seconds and release it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I pressed it... still nothing.

Agent: Alright, let me check a couple things on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to see if we're showing any service issues in your area. (pause, longer pause) One moment please.

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported in Springfield right now. Let me look at your modem status... (typing) Hmm. It's showing as offline, which makes sense given what you're telling me. This might be a hardware issue with the modem itself.

Customer: So... like, it's broken?

Agent: It's possible. How long have you had this modem?

Customer: I don't know, a couple years? Maybe three? I got it when I first set up my service with you guys.

Agent: Okay, so it's had a decent run. (pause) Let me try one more thing before we consider a replacement. Can you make sure all the cables going into the modem are secure? There should be one that comes from the wall—that's the fiber line—and then the power cable we already checked. Can you just wiggle them both and make sure they're tight?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, um, I'm checking them now. The one coming from the wall is pretty snug. (pause) Yeah, they both seem pretty tight to me.

Agent: Good. And just to be thorough—I know this is probably going to sound like... well, you probably already did this, but have you tried restarting your computer or whatever devices you're using? Just to rule that out?

Customer: (laughs) Yeah, actually I did restart my laptop like an hour ago when it first went out. But I guess I could try again.

Agent: It wouldn't hurt.

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, restarting now... (longer pause) ...still nothing coming from the modem.

Agent: Yeah, I was afraid of that. Look, I think the issue here is that the modem itself isn't getting power, and we've ruled out the outlet and the cable. At this point, it's very likely the modem has failed internally. Unfortunately, I'm not able to resolve that remotely.

Customer: Oh man. So what does that mean? How long is it going to take to get a new one?

Agent: Well, we can definitely get a replacement modem sent out to you. Let me pull up our shipping options. (typing sounds) If you need it sooner rather than later, we do have expedited shipping available, but that does come with a small fee. Or we can do standard shipping, which is usually three to five business days.

Customer: Three to five days? I really need internet before then if I can. Can I go somewhere and pick one up, or...?

Agent: Unfortunately, we don't have retail locations where you can pick up modems. Everything ships directly to your home. But like I said, expedited is an option. That would get it to you in one to two business days. (pause) I'm also going to see if there's any way we can expedite this given the circumstances.

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I really appreciate that. Let me think about it... (pause) Actually, you know what, how much is the expedited shipping?

Agent: (typing sounds) That would be $24.99 for overnight, or $14.99 for two-day shipping.

Customer: (pause) Okay, um... I think I'll just go with the standard shipping. I can figure something out in the meantime. Use my phone hotspot or something.

Agent: That's completely understandable. Let me get that order processed for you. (typing sounds) So I'm going to send out a replacement FX-12 modem via standard shipping to your address in Springfield. You should receive it within three to five business days.

Customer: Alright, sounds good.

Agent: I do want to note one thing—when you receive the new modem, there will be a prepaid return label in the box. You'll need to send back the defective modem within 30 days, or there will be a $99 equipment fee charged to your account.

Customer: Oh, okay. Yeah, I can do that.

Agent: Great. And just so you know, when you receive it and set it up, the installation process should be pretty straightforward. The instructions will be in the box, but if you have any trouble, you can always call us back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Okay, yeah, thank you. I appreciate you trying to figure this out.

Agent: Of course. I know it's frustrating to be without internet. I do apologize that we weren't able to get it working today, but I'm confident the new modem will get you back up and running. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome! Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we'll get that modem out to you right away. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
