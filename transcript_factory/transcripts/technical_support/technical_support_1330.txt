Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up and running. I work from home, so this is kind of urgent.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I get a name please?

Customer: It's James Chen.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan at your address on Maple Street. So the internet's been down since this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, since around 7 AM. I turned everything off and back on again like I always do when there's a problem, but nothing's working.

Agent: Right, okay. Well, let's troubleshoot this together. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is your modem powered on?

Customer: The modem's on, yeah. It's got the power light on, but... let me look at the other lights. The internet light isn't on. Usually it's blue or green or something, and right now it's just... nothing.

Agent: Okay, so no internet light. That's helpful information. And your router—do you have an external router or is it all in one unit?

Customer: I have the router you guys gave me. It's the white box thing. And, uh, that one's on too but it's not connecting to anything.

Agent: Right. Let me walk you through some steps here. First, I want you to unplug the modem from the power outlet. Just pull the plug out.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds. While we're waiting, James, have you had any recent storms or anything like that? Or any outages in your area that you're aware of?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine. Actually, now that you mention it, I didn't check if there's an outage. Should I have done that?

Agent: It's something we can check, but let's try the reset first and see if that helps. Okay, 30 seconds should be up. Go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: (sounds of plugging device in) Okay, it's plugged back in now. It's starting up... I can see the power light again.

Agent: Good. And we just want to give it about a minute or two to fully boot up. While that's happening, let me just check our system here to see if there are any known outages in your area. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm not showing any outages on our end. Let me ask you this—do you have any lights on the modem now?

Customer: Um, yeah. The power light is on, and I'm seeing like an orange light now. Is that good?

Agent: The orange light usually means it's connecting or initializing. That's normal during startup. Give it just another minute and see if it turns blue or green.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. Still orange.

Agent: Still orange. How about your router? Are you seeing any lights on that?

Customer: The router has a few lights on it too. They're all kind of... I don't know, cycling through? Like they're blinking.

Agent: Blinking is actually normal—that usually means it's syncing with the modem. Let's give it another 30 seconds or so. (pause) Okay, how about now? What's the modem light showing?

Customer: Still orange. This is weird. It's been like five minutes now.

Agent: Yeah, that is a bit longer than usual. Let me try something else. Can you look at the back of the modem and tell me if there's a cable that goes from the wall into the modem? I want to make sure all the connections are seated properly.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's a cable coming from the wall. It looks... it looks pretty connected to me. It's in there pretty good.

Agent: Okay, can you try gently wiggling it just a little bit? Sometimes if it's not fully seated, it can cause connection issues.

Customer: (pause) I'm wiggling it... nothing's changed. Still orange.

Agent: Alright. Let me have you try another full power cycle. This time, I want you to unplug both the modem and the router. Let's start completely fresh.

Customer: You want me to unplug the router too?

Agent: Yes, please. Both of them.

Customer: Okay. (sounds of unplugging) Both are unplugged now.

Agent: Great. Let them sit for about a minute this time. While we wait, I'm going to check something on the line. (pause) One second, James. Let me just verify that your account is active and there are no billing issues that might be affecting your service.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Is that... is that a common thing?

Agent: It does happen from time to time, yeah. Usually it's not, but I want to rule it out. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm showing that your account is active and everything looks good on our end. No billing issues.

Customer: Alright, so it's not that.

Agent: No, it doesn't look like it. Okay, minute should be up. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first. We'll let that start booting up, and then we'll plug in the router about 30 seconds later.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Modem's plugged in. (pause) Power light's on. Now I'm waiting. (longer pause) Okay, it's been about 30 seconds. Plugging in the router now. (plugging sounds)

Agent: Good. Now we just want to give them a couple minutes to sync up with each other and establish a connection to our network. This is usually the point where that orange light should turn to blue or green.

Customer: (pause, approximately 2 minutes) Um, Derek? Still orange. And actually, you know what, I'm not seeing any lights on the router now either. Just nothing.

Agent: The router lights are off now?

Customer: Yeah. Or they're really dim? I can't really see them.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me check something. Can you tell me what model router you have? There should be a sticker on the back or the bottom that tells you the model number.

Customer: (pause) It says Frontier... FXC-something. FXC... I can't quite read the rest of the numbers. Does that help?

Agent: That does help. That's our standard fiber modem-router combo. Let me check our system for any known issues with that model. (typing sounds, longer pause) Okay, I'm not finding any widespread issues, but there could be a hardware problem. Let me ask you something—when you power it on, do you hear any beeping sounds or anything unusual?

Customer: No, I don't hear any beeping. Just... quiet. It's pretty quiet actually.

Agent: [inaudible] ...that. Okay, James, here's what I'm thinking. We've tried the basic troubleshooting steps and the modem isn't establishing a connection to our network. It's either a device issue or something with the line itself. I'd really like to send a technician out to your place to take a look. They can check the connections coming into your home and test the equipment.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. What does your schedule look like? Are you available tomorrow during the day?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean, I need internet today if possible. I have meetings and everything. Can't someone come out today?

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (pause) Unfortunately, it looks like our next available appointment today is... (typing sounds) ...we're pretty booked up. The earliest we have today is around 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: 5 PM? That's still quite a while from now. I mean, I guess if that's all you have... Yeah, okay. 5 PM works.

Agent: Alright, perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. That would be a window between 5 and 7 PM. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. Is the address on file still correct? Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct. Same address.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you set up for a technician visit today between 5 and 7 PM. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. In the meantime, is there anything else you want to try, or do you want to just wait for the tech?

Customer: No, I think I've tried enough at this point. We've reset it like three times. Something's just not working right.

Agent: I completely agree. You've done everything right. The tech will be able to give you a better answer about whether it's the equipment or the line. Is there anything else I can help you with today, James?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Hopefully they can get it working this afternoon.

Agent: I hope so too. Thanks for your patience, and we appreciate your business with Frontier. You should be all set with that appointment today. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. Have a good day, and sorry again for the trouble.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
