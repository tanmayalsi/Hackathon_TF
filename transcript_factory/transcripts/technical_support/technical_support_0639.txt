Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I can't figure out what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me just pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...5551234567.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got you here. So your internet service went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was approximately?

Customer: Uh, yeah, around 8 or 8:30. I tried unplugging the modem and router and waiting like ten minutes, but nothing. It's still just... nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's a good first step that you already tried. Let me ask you this—when you look at your modem right now, what lights are you seeing on it?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...okay so there's a power light, that's on. But the internet light... the one that's usually blue? That's not on. It's dark.

Agent: Alright, so the internet indicator light isn't illuminated. That tells me the modem isn't syncing with our network. Let's try a few things here. First, can you unplug the modem again and leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds?

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) Unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. While we're waiting, have you experienced any weather in your area recently? Any storms last night or this morning?

Customer: Actually, yeah. There was a pretty bad storm that rolled through around 2 in the morning. Lightning and everything. I didn't think about that being related though.

Agent: That could definitely be it. We sometimes see service interruptions in areas after severe weather. Go ahead and plug the modem back in for me now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) The lights are coming back on... power's on... and I'm seeing some activity lights but... no, the internet light's still off.

Agent: Still not coming on, huh? Okay, let's move to the router. Is that plugged in as well?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, it's right next to it.

Agent: Can you unplug the router and plug it back in?

Customer: Already doing it. (pause) Okay, plugged back in. (pause) The router's lighting up like normal but... (trails off) ...nope, still nothing.

Agent: I'm going to check something on my end here. (typing sounds) What I'm seeing on the account is that we did have a service outage reported in your area this morning, but that was supposed to be cleared as of about 45 minutes ago.

Customer: Oh, so there was an actual outage? It wasn't just my equipment?

Agent: It looks like there was. However, the outage is marked as resolved in our system. Let me reboot your modem from my end here and see if that helps you reconnect to the network. (typing sounds) Okay, give it just a moment...

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it... (pause) ...still waiting...

Agent: The modem should be rebooting right now. It might take a minute or two for everything to cycle back on.

Customer: (longer pause) Alright, the power light's off, and it's coming back on now. The activity lights are blinking... but the internet light... (pause) ...it's still not on. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand. Let me check the line status on my end. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm actually seeing that there might be a line issue here. Have you noticed any damage to the cables or wires outside your home? Sometimes after storms, branches can fall or cables can get pinched.

Customer: I mean, I haven't really looked. Do you want me to go check?

Agent: If you don't mind, yeah. Just take a look around the exterior of your house, see if there's anything obviously damaged or disconnected. I can stay on the line.

Customer: (background noise, sounds of movement) Okay, I'm going out back... (wind noise) ...I don't see anything obviously wrong back here. The cables look okay from what I can see.

Agent: Alright, thanks for checking. Let me try one more thing. Can you tell me—when you look at your modem right now, are there any error lights? Like anything red or orange?

Customer: (pause) No, just the power light and... like, amber-colored activity lights. But the main internet light that should be solid blue... still nothing.

Agent: Yeah, okay. At this point, what I'm suspecting is that the line is either damaged somewhere between our network and your location, or there's an issue at the network hub serving your neighborhood. The outage we had earlier might not have fully cleared for your specific line.

Customer: So what does that mean? What do I do?

Agent: Well, I have a couple options for you. I can either schedule a technician to come out and take a look—we might be able to get someone out within the next couple of days—or we can file a service request to have our network team investigate the line. Given the storm we had, they may need to do some physical inspection of the lines.

Customer: How long would a service request take? And is there any chance they can come out sooner than a couple days?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. For emergency-level service after a weather event, we sometimes can get a technician out the next business day. Let me check... It looks like we do have availability tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Yeah, I mean, I can make that work. Better than waiting longer.

Agent: Great. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to get that scheduled for you. The technician will be there tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. You'll get a confirmation email and we can send a text message as well to confirm. Can I get a mobile number for that text?

Customer: Sure, 5559876543.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) And is there anything else I should make note of for the technician? Like anything else unusual you've noticed?

Customer: No, just that the modem won't sync. That's really the main issue.

Agent: Alright, I've got that all documented. The technician will be equipped to do a full line check and can identify if there's any damage from the storm. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help clarify about the appointment?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you trying to troubleshoot this with me.

Agent: Of course. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today, but I'm confident the technician will be able to get to the root of the issue tomorrow. Your confirmation details are being sent to your email now. Is there anything else I can help with?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow!

Customer: Okay, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
