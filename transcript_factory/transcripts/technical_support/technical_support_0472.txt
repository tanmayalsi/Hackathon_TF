# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm having trouble with my internet. It's completely down right now and I've been without it since this morning.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I grab your account information first? What's the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning? Can you walk me through what happened? Was it working last night?

Customer: Yeah, it was fine last night. I went to bed around eleven, and then this morning when I woke up, I tried to check my email and nothing was loading. Then I realized the modem was dark.

Agent: Okay, so the modem isn't showing any lights at all right now?

Customer: Right, nothing. It's completely off.

Agent: Alright, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you check if the power cable is securely plugged into both the modem and the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. The wall outlet looks fine, and... wait, actually the cable going into the modem feels a little loose. Let me push it in more firmly.

Agent: Good thinking. Go ahead and do that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing it... pushing it in... and... hmm, still nothing. No lights coming on.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Let's try a hard reset. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet completely?

Customer: Yeah, doing it now.

Agent: Great. Can you leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds? Just count it out.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm counting... thirty seconds... okay, it's been thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, I'm watching it... I see a light now. We've got a power light. That's good.

Agent: Excellent! That's a good sign. How many lights do you see on the modem right now?

Customer: Um, I see the power light, and there's... there's another one that's blinking orange right now.

Agent: Okay, so that orange light is typically indicating that the modem is trying to establish a connection with our network. That should turn green once it connects. Can you give that about sixty seconds to see if it changes?

Customer: Sure thing. (pause) Just waiting here... (pause) You know, I really need this working. I've got to get some work done today. I'm working from home.

Agent: I totally understand. Internet is pretty essential these days. (typing sounds) Let's see... is it still orange?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's still orange. Maybe a little less bright now? Like it might be changing? But it's still definitely orange.

Agent: Okay, that's still a good sign. Sometimes it can take a minute or two. Let's try something else in the meantime. Can you tell me, are you using WiFi or are you connected with an ethernet cable?

Customer: I'm on WiFi. My computer is across the room.

Agent: Alright, so once we get this modem connection stabilized, the WiFi should come back up too. (pause) How long has it been now since you plugged it back in?

Customer: About a minute and a half, I'd say.

Agent: Great, let's give it another thirty seconds. And while we're waiting, let me ask you a couple questions. Have you had any recent storms in your area? Or any power outages?

Customer: No, actually. The weather's been pretty clear. And the power in my house has been fine all day.

Agent: Okay, that's good. That rules out a few things. (pause) How about your router? Do you have a separate WiFi router?

Customer: No, the modem has the router built in. I think it's just the one unit.

Agent: Perfect, that makes things simpler. (pause) Let's check on that orange light again. What's it doing now?

Customer: (pause) It's still orange. Maybe a tiny bit dimmer, but yeah, still orange. Should I unplug it again?

Agent: Let me try something different before we do that. Let me put you on a quick hold while I check something on our end. I want to see if there's any service alerts in your area. It'll just be about thirty seconds.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (hold music for 20 seconds)

Agent: Alright, I'm back. I don't see any service outages in your area, so that's not it. Okay, let's try this. Go ahead and unplug the modem again, but this time, I also want you to unplug the battery backup if you have one.

Customer: Battery backup? Um, I'm not sure what that is.

Agent: It's usually a smaller box or device near your modem. Does that sound like something you have?

Customer: No, I don't think so. Just the modem.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Just unplug the modem again, but this time leave it unplugged for two full minutes. This is a deeper reset.

Customer: Alright, unplugging it now. (pause) So I'm just waiting two minutes?

Agent: Yep, just two full minutes. Sometimes the system needs a longer reset to clear out any connection issues.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Taking a while isn't it? (nervous laugh)

Agent: (chuckling) I know it feels long. So how long have you been a Frontier customer, James?

Customer: Um, about three years now, I think? Maybe a little longer. I've never had issues like this before.

Agent: That's good. We like to hear when our customers have good experiences. Alright, has it been two minutes?

Customer: Yeah, basically. Maybe a few seconds more.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, the power light's on again. And I'm watching for the other light...

Agent: Good.

Customer: (pause) It's... it's still orange again. Same thing as before.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let me put you on another brief hold. I'm going to check if maybe there's a line issue on our end. Just stay with me.

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (hold music for 45 seconds)

Agent: Alright, I'm back. So I've checked the line status and I'm not seeing any obvious issues from our equipment, but I am noticing something. Your modem seems to be having trouble authenticating with our network. This could be a few different things—it could be a problem with the modem itself, or it could be something on the line.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, there are a couple more things we can try. But I have to be honest with you, if this doesn't work, we might need to schedule a technician to come out and take a look at the line and the equipment.

Customer: Oh man, how long would that take? I really need internet today.

Agent: I understand. Let me see... (typing sounds) Our next available appointment is... tomorrow afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. 

Customer: Can't do it any sooner than that?

Agent: Unfortunately not today. But let's not give up yet. Let me try one more thing. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem from here. It might take a minute to process. Don't unplug anything this time.

Customer: Okay, what should I be looking for?

Agent: Just watch the lights. You might see them flicker or blink differently for a moment. It shouldn't take more than a minute or so.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm watching... (pause) The orange light is still there. It's steady. (pause) Hmm, nothing's changing.

Agent: Okay, give it another thirty seconds. Sometimes it takes a moment to register.

Customer: (pause) ...Still orange. I'm not seeing any change.

Agent: (pause) Alright, James, I wish I had better news for you. Unfortunately, the steps we've taken haven't resolved the connection issue on your end. At this point, I really do think we need to get a technician out there to diagnose what's going on with either your line or your equipment.

Customer: So I'm stuck without internet until tomorrow?

Agent: I know this is frustrating. But yes, unless something changes in the next little while, a technician visit is going to be our best bet to get you back online. The good news is that our technicians are usually pretty quick at finding and fixing these issues.

Customer: Alright. What do I need to do to schedule that?

Agent: I can actually go ahead and schedule that for you right now. Like I said, the next available slot is tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. There won't be any additional charge for the service call since we haven't identified any customer-caused damage. 

Customer: Okay, I guess that's something. Yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I'm going to add you to the schedule for tomorrow. A technician will arrive sometime between 1 and 5 PM. You should receive a confirmation text and email with more details within the next hour or so.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: And James, one more thing—just keep that modem plugged in and powered on overnight. Sometimes things do resolve on their own, so there's a small chance it could come back online before the tech arrives tomorrow. But if it doesn't, the technician will be all set to help.

Customer: I appreciate it. I'm not thrilled about losing a day of work, but I understand.

Agent: I really am sorry about this. We'll get you back up and running. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for calling Frontier, and again, sorry for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Thanks for trying.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
