# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, so my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here real quick so we can get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's the same number you just called me on. Area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Great, James. Thanks for that. So you're saying your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you had any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been a totally normal day. The power's fine, everything else is working. It's just... the internet's completely dead. No lights on the modem or anything.

Agent: Okay, so no lights on the modem—that actually tells me something. First thing I want you to do is let's do a hard reset on the modem. Can you locate your modem right now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it. It's just... nothing. All the lights are off.

Agent: All right. So what I need you to do is unplug the power cable from the back of the modem. Just pull it straight out.

Customer: (pause) Done.

Agent: Perfect. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds. I know it seems like a long time, but this really does help reset the system.

Customer: (pause) Okay... it's been like thirty seconds probably.

Agent: Great. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (plugging sound) All right, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Excellent. Now let's give it a minute or two to boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me—are you using a wireless connection or are you hardwired with an ethernet cable?

Customer: I'm wireless. My computer's upstairs and the modem's downstairs, so... yeah, wireless.

Agent: Got it. That's helpful to know. Go ahead and let me know once you start seeing some lights come on on the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm seeing... there's a light now. It's like amber or yellow colored. Um, still nothing else though.

Agent: Okay, that's normal. That's the startup sequence. It should cycle through a few different colors. Give it another minute or so.

Customer: (longer pause) All right, now there's like... I see green lights now. Multiple ones.

Agent: Perfect, James. That's exactly what we want to see. Now let's try connecting your computer to the network. Do you see your network name pop up when you go to connect?

Customer: Let me check... (pause) Yeah, I see my network, it shows up. Let me click on it... and... (pause) it's asking for my password.

Agent: Good, that's normal. Go ahead and enter your Wi-Fi password.

Customer: (typing sounds) All right, I'm entering it... and I'm trying to connect...

Agent: (pause) Is it connecting?

Customer: Um... (pause) It says "connected" but like... nothing's loading. I'm trying to open Google and the page just won't load. It's spinning and spinning.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Let's try a different approach. Can you tell me if you're seeing a light on the modem that says either "Internet" or "WAN" status?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see one that says Internet. It's... it's amber.

Agent: It's still amber? Okay, that typically means it hasn't fully connected to our network yet. Sometimes this takes a bit longer than usual. How long has it been since you plugged it back in?

Customer: Probably like... four or five minutes now?

Agent: All right, that's good. In most cases it should complete within ten. Let's give it another couple minutes and then we'll check again.

Customer: Okay, but... is this normal? Like, should it really take this long?

Agent: It can sometimes, especially if there's been an outage in the area or if the modem needs to resynchronize. But you know what, let me just check your account here... (typing sounds) Let me see if there's anything on our end that might be causing this.

(pause)

Agent: Okay, so on my end it's showing that your modem is currently offline. So it's trying to connect but it hasn't successfully registered with our network yet.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, how do I fix that?

Agent: Well, there are a few things we can try. First, can you check if there are any cables going into the modem? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's a couple cables. Let me... (pause) there's one going into the wall and then like a power cable. They both look pretty secure to me.

Agent: Okay, that's good. Um, can you try unplugging the cable that goes into the wall? The one that looks like a phone line or a thick coax cable?

Customer: The coax one?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Give that a try.

Customer: (pause) Unplugged. Now what?

Agent: Let's wait about fifteen seconds.

Customer: (pause) All right.

Agent: Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) It's back in. But honestly, the lights are doing the same thing. The Internet light went back to amber.

Agent: Yeah, that's expected. Let's give it another minute or two to see if it cycles to green.

(pause)

Customer: Still amber.

Agent: Still amber? Okay. (pause) Let me check something here. James, I'm going to put you on a quick hold while I check with our technical team about any possible outages or issues in your area. It should only be about a minute or two.

Customer: Okay, sure.

(hold music plays)

(hold music stops)

Agent: James, thanks for holding. So I checked and there are no outages reported in your area right now. I did see that we've got a signal issue coming from your modem connection. This could be a few different things. It could be an issue with the outside line, or it could unfortunately be that the modem itself is experiencing a hardware failure.

Customer: Oh no. So... what, I need a new modem?

Agent: Well, before we go there, I want to try one more thing with you if you have time. Have you noticed any damage to the cable that runs into your modem? Anything pinched or bent or anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... no, it looks fine to me. Looks normal.

Agent: Okay. Um, and how long have you had this modem with us?

Customer: I mean, we've had Frontier for like five years, so... I don't know, maybe three years? Four years?

Agent: Okay. All right, James, I hate to say this, but based on everything we've tried and the fact that the modem won't sync to our network, I think the modem might be failing. Usually we can work around these things, but in this case, the Internet light staying amber even after the reset is... it's pretty indicative of a hardware issue.

Customer: So you're saying I need to come pick up a new modem or...?

Agent: Actually, we can ship one out to you. It typically takes about five to seven business days. In the meantime, if you need internet, you might want to consider using your phone's hotspot or visiting a local coffee shop or something.

Customer: (sighs) Five to seven days? That's... that's a long time. Can't you guys send someone out here or something?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me see what options we have for expedited shipping... (typing sounds) Unfortunately, our next available expedited option would be two to three business days, and there would be a thirty-dollar rush fee associated with that.

Customer: (pause) So I'm just... without internet for that long?

Agent: I know it's not ideal. Is there any chance you could—

Customer: No, I really can't. I work from home. I need this.

Agent: I completely understand. In that case, the expedited shipping might be your best option. Or, if you have a Frontier store location near you, we might have modems available for immediate pickup. Do you know if there's a store location in your area?

Customer: I... not really. I don't think so. There might be one, but I'm not sure.

Agent: Okay, let me look that up for you. (typing sounds) I'm showing we have a location about eight miles from you in downtown. Would that be convenient for you at all?

Customer: (pause) I mean, it's not that far. How soon could I get one?

Agent: They're open until seven today, and they should have units in stock. You'd just need to bring your account number.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Yeah, I guess I could do that. What's the address?

Agent: (typing sounds) It's 2847 Commerce Drive. That's Suite 140.

Customer: 2847 Commerce Drive, Suite 140. Got it.

Agent: Perfect. And James, I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved remotely. I want to let you know that when you get the new modem, if you have any trouble setting it up, you can always call us back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks, I guess. I'll head down there now.

Agent: Thank you so much for your patience today, James, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: All right, have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
