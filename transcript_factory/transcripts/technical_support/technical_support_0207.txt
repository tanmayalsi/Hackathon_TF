Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... uh, (pause) it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Scottsdale area. So you're getting no internet connection at all right now?

Customer: Right, nothing. I tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in, like, twice. The modem has some lights on it but... I don't know, it doesn't seem right.

Agent: Okay, that's good that you already tried that. Let me ask you a few questions. When you look at the modem, what color are the lights that are on?

Customer: Uh... there's like a green light on the front, but then there's a red light that keeps blinking. Is that bad?

Agent: That red blinking light—that typically indicates there's no signal coming into your equipment. So let's troubleshoot this. Can you check the cable connections for me? There should be a coaxial cable coming from the wall into your modem.

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I see it. It looks... it looks fine. It's plugged in.

Agent: Okay, and it's tight? Can you just give it a gentle tug to make sure it's secure?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I just did. It seems pretty solid.

Agent: Great. And is the ethernet cable that goes from your modem to your router—do you see that one?

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) actually, I don't think I have an external router. Isn't the modem the... isn't that everything?

Agent: Oh, so you're just using the modem itself for your connection?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. It's the box that Frontier sent me.

Agent: Okay, that makes sense. Some of our equipment has the router built in. Let me ask you this—when you power cycle the modem, do you wait for all the lights to stop blinking and settle before you try to connect?

Customer: Hmm, I'm not sure. I just unplugged it, waited like... maybe ten seconds, and plugged it back in.

Agent: Okay, let's try that again, but this time give it a full two minutes. That allows the system to fully boot up. Go ahead and unplug it now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now.

Agent: Perfect. While we wait, I'm going to check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your line here and I'm not seeing any connectivity issues on our network side. So let's give it those two minutes. How long have you been a customer with us, David?

Customer: Uh, about eight months now. Actually, this is the first problem I've had, so that's... that's good, I guess.

Agent: That's great to hear. Well, we'll get this sorted out for you. (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's plugged back in. (pause) Now I'm seeing... the green light is on. The red one is still blinking though.

Agent: Okay, let me give it a few more seconds to fully boot. These things can take thirty to forty-five seconds sometimes.

Customer: (background noise—sound of waiting) Still blinking...

Agent: Alright, still blinking? That's concerning. Let me check something. David, do you have a desktop computer or a laptop?

Customer: I have a laptop.

Agent: Perfect. Can you go ahead and try to open your browser and see if you can connect to anything?

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) No, I'm getting... it says connection failed or something. (pause) No internet.

Agent: Okay. And you're not seeing any Wi-Fi networks available to connect to?

Customer: Oh wait, let me check the Wi-Fi. (pause) Actually, I do see my network name showing up. Let me try connecting to it.

Agent: Oh, good, good. Go ahead.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it says it's connected now, but... (pause) no, it's not loading anything. The pages won't load.

Agent: Hmm. Let me check the signal strength on your end. What does it show?

Customer: It says "excellent" signal.

Agent: Excellent signal but no internet access. (pause) Okay, David, I think we may be dealing with a line issue on our end. Let me try a few more things. Can you restart the modem one more time? This time, try unplugging it for about thirty seconds.

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) Unplugging it again.

Agent: And while that's unplugged, I'm going to check your account here for any service alerts in your area. (typing sounds) I don't see any widespread outages reported, but that doesn't necessarily mean...

Customer: Plugging it back in. (pause) And... (pause) nope, same thing. Still got that red light blinking.

Agent: Okay. (pause) David, I've got to be honest with you—given that the red light is persistent and we're not getting a signal on the line, I think there might be an issue with the connection from our network to your home. That could be anything from a splice issue in the line to a problem at the node level.

Customer: So... what does that mean? What do I do?

Agent: Well, normally what we'd do next is schedule a technician to come out and check your line. They can test the signal coming into your house and identify where the problem is.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet for work tomorrow.

Agent: I understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds, pause) It looks like we can get a technician out to you tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sighs) Tomorrow? That's... I mean, that's better than nothing. But I really need it today if possible.

Agent: I apologize, David. Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day appointments available in your area, but I can definitely prioritize this ticket and make a note that this is urgent for you. And if a technician opens up today, we can try to reach you.

Customer: Okay, I guess that's... that's the best you can do?

Agent: I'm sorry I couldn't get this resolved for you remotely. But the good news is, once a technician looks at it, we should be able to pinpoint the problem quickly. Is the 8 AM to 12 PM window tomorrow okay?

Customer: Yeah, fine. That works.

Agent: Great. I'm going to confirm that appointment for you. And David, I'm also going to add a service credit to your account for today—it's the least we can do for the inconvenience.

Customer: Oh, okay. Thanks, I appreciate that.

Agent: You're welcome. So to recap—you have a technician appointment tomorrow morning, 8 AM to 12 PM. Is there a best number to reach you at if they need to call ahead?

Customer: Same number you called, or I mean, the number on the account should work.

Agent: Perfect. I've got it noted here. You should receive a confirmation email shortly as well. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident they will. Again, I apologize that we couldn't resolve this today. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, David, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Alright, thanks Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
