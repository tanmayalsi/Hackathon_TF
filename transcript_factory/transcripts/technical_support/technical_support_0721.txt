# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went down this morning and I can't get it back up. I've been without service for like... three hours now and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147... and what's the name on the account?

Customer: Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got your account here. I can see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So your internet just went down this morning, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, like around 8 AM. I was working from home and everything just... stopped. The router's on, the lights are blinking, but I'm not getting any connection.

Agent: Alright. Well, let me start with some basic troubleshooting, okay? First, can you tell me what color the lights are on your modem right now? There should be a few different lights on the front.

Customer: Um... (pause) there's like a white light and then there's... it looks like it's amber? Or orange? One of them is definitely orange.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing an amber light. That typically indicates there might be a connection issue. Let's try a quick restart. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cord out.

Customer: (background noise of movement) Yeah, okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about thirty seconds. I'll count down for you here... (pause) And go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's back in. Now what?

Agent: Now we're just gonna wait a minute or two for it to fully boot back up. While that's happening, let me ask you a few questions. Have there been any recent storms in your area? Sometimes weather can affect the connection.

Customer: No, no storms. It's been clear all week actually.

Agent: Okay, and have you made any changes to your setup recently? New devices, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. It was working fine yesterday.

Agent: (pause) Alright, what are we looking at now on the modem lights?

Customer: Um... the white light is on now, but that orange one is still there. It's not... it doesn't look like it's changed much.

Agent: Okay. Let me try something else. Can you locate the reset button on the back of the modem? It should be a small button, might be recessed in a little hole.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's like a tiny button back here.

Agent: Perfect. I'm gonna have you hold that for about ten seconds. This will reset the modem to factory settings, so just be aware of that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... (another pause) ...ten seconds, right?

Agent: That's right. Go ahead and release it now.

Customer: (sounds of button release) Done. So... is that gonna help?

Agent: Well, we'll see here in a moment. Let's give it another minute to boot back up completely.

(pause - approximately 60 seconds of silence with occasional modem sounds)

Customer: Okay, so... same thing. Orange light. Still no internet.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your connection status... (longer pause) ...and I'm seeing that there might be an issue with the signal coming into your location.

Customer: What do you mean? Like, with my connection specifically?

Agent: It could be a few different things. It could be an issue with the line to your house, or it could be something at the node in your neighborhood. Let me pull up the network diagnostics here. (pause) I'm actually showing some intermittent signal drops in your area. There may be an issue with the fiber line itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long is this gonna take to fix?

Agent: Well, let me escalate this to our Technical Operations team. They may need to send someone out to inspect the line. Can you tell me... are any of your neighbors also experiencing issues? Do you know?

Customer: I mean... (pause) ...I haven't talked to anybody. I could knock on someone's door, but I don't really—

Agent: No, no, that's alright. I can check on my end here as well. (typing) Let me see if there are any reported outages in your area... (pause) I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported, so this might be isolated to your line.

Customer: Okay, so what's the next step? I kind of need my internet working today.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me place a service ticket for a technician visit. They typically try to schedule these within 24 to 48 hours. Would you prefer a morning or afternoon appointment?

Customer: I mean... sooner would be better, but I guess I need to work around whatever you have available. Morning might be better for me.

Agent: (typing) Alright, let me see what we have available. (pause) Okay, so we have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that works. Tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. And just to be thorough, let me try one more thing before we wrap up. Do you have your Wi-Fi password handy? Sometimes we can get around a connection issue by—

Customer: I mean, I tried connecting with my phone too. That didn't work either.

Agent: Right, right. Okay, so it's definitely not just a Wi-Fi issue on the router side. I had to ask. (pause) Alright, Michael, here's what I have set up for you. We have a technician scheduled for tomorrow morning, 8 AM to 12 PM. You'll receive a confirmation text and email shortly. The technician will inspect your fiber line and modem connection to identify the issue.

Customer: Okay. And if... what if they can't fix it tomorrow? What happens then?

Agent: Well, they're usually pretty good about identifying issues on the spot. If it's a modem issue, they can replace it. If it's a line issue, they may need to do some work outside, which they can do the same day. In rare cases, if it requires more extensive repair, they'll let you know what the next steps are.

Customer: Alright. I guess I'll just... have to wait it out till tomorrow then. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize that we couldn't get it resolved today. Our team will take good care of you tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with right now?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Just hoping this gets fixed.

Agent: We'll get you back online as soon as we can, Michael. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: Have a good day.
