# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I've got work calls scheduled and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847. That's the number tied to the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. One moment... Alright, I've got you here. It looks like you're on our Fiber 200 plan in the Glendale area. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So your internet's completely down? You're not getting any connection at all?

Customer: Nothing. I tried unplugging the router, waited like five minutes, plugged it back in... still nothing. The lights on the modem are just... I don't know, they're not doing what they usually do.

Agent: Okay, that's a good troubleshooting step. Let me ask you—when you look at the modem, do you see any lights on it at all?

Customer: Um, there's a red light, I think? Or maybe it's orange. It's definitely not the normal blue I usually see.

Agent: Alright, and just to confirm, the modem is the device that's connected to the wall outlet, right? Not the router?

Customer: Yeah, I know the difference. (pause) The modem is the box with all the lights, right?

Agent: Yes, exactly. And do you see a power light that's on?

Customer: Yeah, there's definitely power. The whole thing is lit up, but just with that red or orange color.

Agent: Got it. That red or orange light typically indicates either a connection issue or possibly an outage. Let me check our system here to see if there's anything on our end. (typing sounds) Are you in the 91201 zip code?

Customer: Yes, 91201.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported in your area at the moment. However, that doesn't mean there isn't an issue with your line specifically. Let's try a few more things. Can you unplug the modem one more time? Just for about 30 seconds this time.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, it's unplugged now.

Agent: Great, and while it's unplugged, can you also unplug the router if it's a separate device?

Customer: Okay, yeah, I'm doing that now. (pause) Both are unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give it about 30 seconds. While we're waiting, have you experienced any outages recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, this is the first time. I mean, I've had like, a brief hiccup here and there, but nothing like this. It was working fine last night.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: Alright, plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, it's back in. Now the router?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug the router back in as well.

Customer: (pause) Done. (pause) Hmm, I'm still seeing the same red light.

Agent: Still red. Okay. (pause) Can you give it about two minutes to fully boot up? Sometimes it takes a moment.

Customer: (pause) I can wait. (longer pause) It's been like two minutes now, still red.

Agent: Alright, I'm going to try something from our end. Can you hold for just one moment while I access your modem remotely?

Customer: Sure, go ahead.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, then returns) Okay, I'm back. I attempted to remotely connect to your modem, but I'm not getting a connection on our end either. That suggests that your modem might not be communicating with our network at all.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is the modem broken?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be the modem, or it could be an issue with the line coming into your home. Can you check behind your modem? There should be a cable going from the wall to the modem—do you see that?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's... (pause) it looks fine to me. The cable is plugged in.

Agent: Can you try unplugging that cable from the modem and plugging it back in? Sometimes they can come loose a little bit.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that now. (pause) Plugged it back in. (pause) Nope, still red.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Let me also ask—do you have a battery backup unit? Sometimes those can cause issues.

Customer: I... I don't think so? I just have the modem and the router.

Agent: That's fine. Let me check something in the system. (typing sounds) (pause) You know what, I'm going to be honest with you—based on what I'm seeing, and the fact that the modem isn't registering on our network at all, it sounds like there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or potentially a problem with the line connection that's going to require a technician to come out.

Customer: Wait, seriously? So I have to wait for a technician? How long is that going to take?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds, pause) I can actually get someone out to you tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't they come out today? This is urgent.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize. Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day appointments available in your area. Tomorrow is the earliest I can get someone out. But I'll make sure they prioritize your appointment, and if it is the modem, we can replace it on site.

Customer: (sighs) Tomorrow, 1 to 5... I guess that's fine. I mean, it's not ideal, but okay.

Agent: I really do apologize for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can try in the meantime? Any other devices you have that might help troubleshoot?

Customer: I mean... I have my phone, but that's just on cellular. That's not going to help, right?

Agent: No, unfortunately not. Okay, you're all set for tomorrow. Your appointment is confirmed for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's it. Hopefully the tech can figure it out tomorrow.

Agent: We'll do our best. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day.
