Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I'm showing service at 2847 Riverside Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So your internet went down this morning, you said? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Uh, around 7 AM, maybe 7:30. I tried to work from home and nothing. Just completely dead.

Agent: Okay, and just to confirm—you're not seeing any lights on your router or modem right now?

Customer: Well, the modem has some lights on it. Like, there's a green light and a red light. The green one is solid but the red one's blinking really fast.

Agent: Okay, so the red light is blinking quickly. That typically indicates a connection issue. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Have you tried unplugging the modem and router yet?

Customer: No, I haven't actually. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Let's try that first. Go ahead and unplug the modem for me—that's usually the device that has all the cables coming out of it—and just wait about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. How long do you want me to wait?

Agent: Just about thirty seconds. While we're waiting, let me ask—are you renting the modem from us or did you purchase your own?

Customer: I'm renting it. It came with the service when I signed up.

Agent: Got it. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in device) Alright, it's plugged back in. It's... it's booting up. I can see the lights coming back.

Agent: Great. So now what we want to see is... we want the lights to stabilize. Give it about a minute or so to fully boot up. Is the red light still blinking?

Customer: Yeah, it's still blinking pretty fast.

Agent: (pause) Okay. And just to double-check—do you see the ethernet cable going from the modem to your router? Is that cable plugged in tight on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Hold on, let me look back there. It's a little dark back here... yeah, the cables look like they're plugged in. There's a bunch of cables though.

Agent: I understand. So you should see—there's usually one cable that goes into the modem from the wall, and then there's an ethernet cable that should go from the modem to your router, if you have a separate router.

Customer: Right, yeah, I see both of those.

Agent: Okay, can you try wiggling those cables a little bit? Make sure they're really secure?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that now. Let me... yeah, let me check the one in the wall too. (pause) They seem pretty tight. Still got the red blinking light though.

Agent: Alright, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Hmm. I'm actually not seeing any connection from your modem to our network right now. That could be a few things. Let me ask you something—have there been any storms in your area recently? Any power outages?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Weather's been fine all week.

Agent: Okay. And this is the first time this has happened since you've had the service with us?

Customer: Yeah, first time. It's been pretty reliable up until today.

Agent: I appreciate you saying that. Let's try one more thing. Can you restart your router as well? Usually that's the separate device, typically a bit smaller—

Customer: Oh, it's one of those combo units, I think. It's just the one device.

Agent: Ah, okay. That's actually a combo modem-router. That makes it easier. So just unplug that device again, and this time leave it unplugged for about forty-five seconds. We really want to give it a full reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugged. I'm counting... (long pause) Alright, should be about forty-five seconds. Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. And while that's booting back up, let me ask—are you trying to connect a computer to it directly with an ethernet cable, or are you using WiFi?

Customer: WiFi. I've got a laptop.

Agent: Okay, so give it another minute to fully boot up, and then try connecting to your WiFi network. See if you can open a web browser and let me know if you're getting any internet.

Customer: (pause, sounds of keyboard) Okay, I'm connecting to the WiFi now... it's connecting... okay, it says I'm connected. But when I try to open, like, Google... (pause) nothing. Page won't load.

Agent: (pause) Okay. So you're connected to the WiFi but you're not getting any internet. That's... (typing sounds) Let me check the modem status again. (longer pause) I'm not showing any active connection to our network. The modem is recognized as a device, but there's no data connection coming through.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It typically means there's either an issue with the modem itself, or there's something on the line side—like the fiber line coming into your home. Given that you just unplugged and replugged everything, and you're still not seeing that green connection light... I'm going to be honest, it sounds like it might be a hardware issue with the modem or a connection problem that we'd need to investigate from our end.

Customer: So... what do I do? Can you send someone out here?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. We can set up a service appointment for you. However, before we do that, let me try one last thing. Let me see if I can send a reset command to the modem from here. Sometimes that can help. This might take just a moment...

(typing sounds, pause)

Agent: Okay, I've sent the command. Give it about two minutes and let's see if anything changes with those lights.

Customer: (pause) Okay. I'm watching it now. The green light is still solid but the red one is still blinking fast.

Agent: Yeah, I'm not seeing the connection come through on my end either. Unfortunately, I think at this point we're going to need to get a technician out to take a look at either the modem or the line. The good news is I can get you scheduled pretty quickly.

Customer: How quickly are we talking?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available... We can get someone out there tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we have an opening on Thursday afternoon, 1 to 5 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works better for me. Can we do that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. I'll need to verify your contact number, and then you should receive a confirmation. Is 555-0147 the best number to reach you on?

Customer: Uh, that's my home line, so yes, that works. Or I can give you my cell phone too if that's better.

Agent: No, your home number is fine. Just to confirm, we have you down for tomorrow, between 8 AM and noon. The technician will take a look at your modem and check your line. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can figure it out.

Agent: I understand. You should receive an email confirmation shortly, and the technician will also call about thirty minutes before they arrive. If you have any other questions before then, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Okay, thanks for trying.

Agent: You're welcome, and sorry again for the trouble. We appreciate your patience, and we'll get you back online as soon as we can.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye.
