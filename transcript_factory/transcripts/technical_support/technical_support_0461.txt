Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get this fixed. I work from home and I'm completely dead in the water here.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me get some information from you so we can troubleshoot this together. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Thank you. And just to confirm, this is for the service at 2341 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So your internet went down this morning, you said? Has it been completely out, or is it intermittent?

Customer: No, it's completely out. I don't have any connection at all. I tried restarting my router this morning, unplugging it for like a minute, and nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, I appreciate you already trying that. That's a good first step. Let me just pull up your account here... (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, I'm seeing your service is active on our end. No alerts or outages in your area. Do you have a modem and a router, or is it a combo unit?

Customer: Um, it's a combo unit. The one you guys provided.

Agent: Great. So right now, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on the modem? Are there any lights on at all?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's... let me look. The power light is on, it's green. But um, the internet light—I think it's the one that looks like a globe or whatever—that one's not on. It's dark.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on but the internet light is off. That tells me the modem isn't syncing with our network. Have you tried power cycling the modem? Just unplugging it from the wall for about 30 seconds?

Customer: I thought I did that already with the router...

Agent: I understand, but let's try it specifically with the modem if you haven't. Sometimes it needs a full reset.

Customer: (pause) Alright, give me a second. (background noise, rustling) I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and count to about 30 seconds and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) ...alright, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about 60 seconds to boot back up. While that's happening, can I ask—have there been any recent storms in your area? Or any construction work near your home?

Customer: (pause) No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine. It just... it just stopped working overnight. I don't know what happened.

Agent: I hear you. Sometimes these things just happen unfortunately. (pause) Okay, are you seeing any lights on the modem now?

Customer: (pause) Uh... still just the power light. The internet light is still off.

Agent: Still off? Hmm. Okay, let me try something else. I'm going to check your line from our end. (typing sounds) (pause) Can you hold for just one moment while I run a quick diagnostic?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music) (pause) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I ran a diagnostic and... I'm actually seeing signal on our end, which is interesting. The line looks like it's sending data. So the issue might be with the modem itself or the connection between the modem and your home.

Customer: So what do you mean? Like, the modem is broken?

Agent: Well, it could be, but let me walk through a couple more things before we go there. Can you check where the coaxial cable connects to the modem? Sometimes they can come loose, or if there's a splitter involved, that might be the issue.

Customer: (pause) Hold on, let me look behind the TV here... (background noise) Okay, I'm looking at it. It looks... it looks tight to me. I can see the cable going into the modem.

Agent: Can you try disconnecting it and reconnecting it? Just to make sure it's seated properly.

Customer: (pause) (rustling sounds) Okay, I disconnected it... now I'm plugging it back in. (clicking sound) It's back in.

Agent: Good. Now let's give it another minute to see if that helps with the connection.

Customer: (pause) ...Yeah, I'm still not seeing the internet light come on.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Okay, this is frustrating. Let me ask—when you say the internet light isn't on, is it completely dark or is it showing any color at all? Red, orange, anything?

Customer: [inaudible] No, it's just... it's off. It's dark.

Agent: Alright. And the power light is still solid green?

Customer: Yes, it's green.

Agent: Okay. (typing sounds) You know what, I think at this point the modem might need to be replaced. I'm not seeing any issues on our network infrastructure side, and we've done the standard troubleshooting steps. The fact that the internet light won't come on after all of this suggests the modem itself might be the problem.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long is that gonna take?

Agent: Well, we can definitely get you a replacement modem. Let me check our availability for a technician to come out. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest we have available is tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 6 PM. Does that work for your schedule?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean... I guess that's... can you do this faster? Like, is there any way to get someone out today?

Agent: Let me see... (typing sounds) (pause) Unfortunately, all our same-day slots are booked today. Tomorrow's our earliest availability.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, I really need this working for work tomorrow. I have meetings...

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry about the inconvenience. But I do want to try one more thing before we schedule that technician. Can you unplug the modem and wait about two minutes this time? Sometimes if we do a deeper reset, it can help.

Customer: (pause) I've already done this like... three times now.

Agent: I know, I know. I apologize. But this will be with a longer wait time, so let's give it a shot.

Customer: (sigh) Alright, fine. (background noise, unplugging sound) (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: (pause) Let's wait about two minutes. I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: Okay... (pause) (pause) So you think this is actually gonna work this time?

Agent: Honestly, it's a long shot at this point, but it's worth trying before we go with the replacement unit.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I think two minutes is up.

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (plugging sound) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) (pause) Let me look at the lights...

Agent: Anything?

Customer: (pause) No. Still just the power light. The internet light is still not coming on.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I'm sorry, but I think we're gonna need to go with that technician visit. The modem definitely needs to be replaced at this point. So let me get you scheduled for tomorrow between 2 and 6 PM. Is that still okay?

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, I guess it has to be. This is really not ideal.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize. When the technician comes out tomorrow, they'll bring a new modem and get everything up and running for you. In the meantime, if you have a mobile device, you could potentially use your phone's hotspot as a temporary workaround.

Customer: Yeah, I thought about that. My hotspot is pretty limited on data though.

Agent: I hear you. Well, hopefully the tech can get out there and get this resolved quickly tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

Agent: Thank you for your patience today. We really do apologize for the inconvenience. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details for tomorrow's appointment. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
