# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging the router and everything, and it's just... nothing.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick so I can help you out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking here... and I've got you down as a fiber customer in the Springdale area, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet is down. When exactly did you notice it went out?

Customer: It was sometime this morning, maybe around 8 or 9 AM? I went to check my email and nothing was loading.

Agent: Okay, and you've already tried unplugging the router. That's good. Let me walk you through a few more troubleshooting steps. First, can you look at your modem—that's the device connected to your wall outlet—and tell me what lights you're seeing on it?

Customer: (pause) Um, okay, so... I'm looking at it now. There's... well, it's mostly dark. There's like a tiny red light on the bottom, but that's about it.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing a red light. That typically indicates there might be a connection issue. Can you tell me if the cable going into the modem—the one from the wall outlet—is it plugged in securely?

Customer: Yeah, I checked that. It seems pretty tight to me.

Agent: Good. And just to confirm, your modem is the device we provided with the fiber installation, right? Not something you purchased separately?

Customer: No, it's the one you guys gave me. The Frontier one.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, here's what I want you to do. Go ahead and unplug the modem from the wall outlet for about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. Sometimes a hard reboot can resolve these issues.

Customer: Okay, (pause) unplugging it now... (pause) Alright, let's give it like 30 seconds... (pause) ...and plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about a minute or two to boot back up. What you should see is the lights starting to come back on. Can you describe what's happening?

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, so it's... the red light is still there, and now there's like a green light, but it's blinking?

Agent: Okay, the green blinking light is actually normal—that usually means it's trying to connect. Let's give it another 30 seconds or so to fully establish the connection.

Customer: (pause) Still blinking. Is that... is that bad?

Agent: Not necessarily. Let me just check on our end if there are any service issues in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm not seeing any outages reported in Springdale at the moment.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could mean a few things. It could be an issue with the modem itself, or possibly with the line coming into your home. Um, have you noticed any loose cables or anything damaged outside near your home? Sometimes weather or animals can affect the connection.

Customer: (pause) No, I didn't see anything unusual. Everything looked fine to me.

Agent: Okay. Let me try one more thing here. Can you check the back of the modem and make sure all the cables are nice and snug? There should be a cable coming from the wall and another that goes to your router.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking... (pause) ...both look connected to me. They're pretty tight.

Agent: Alright. And is your router powered on as well?

Customer: Oh, actually, let me check. (pause) Yeah, the router's on. It's got lights, but... I don't think it's receiving any signal from the modem.

Agent: Right, that makes sense if the modem isn't connecting. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that the modem is still blinking that green light, which tells me it's still trying to sync. This sometimes can take a while if there's a network issue. Let me check something on my end... (typing sounds) (pause) Can you hold for just a quick second while I look at your line status?

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (pause) (background hold music) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I'm not seeing any obvious issues from our network side, but I am seeing something interesting. It looks like we might need to send a technician out to check your equipment and your line connection. How does that sound?

Customer: A technician? Like, when would that be? I really need my internet back.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what availability we have... (typing sounds) (pause) Looks like we could get someone out there tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Isn't there any sooner? Like today?

Agent: Let me check... (pause) Unfortunately, today is pretty booked up. Tomorrow morning we might have something, but it would be pretty early, like between 8 and 11 AM. Would that be feasible?

Customer: (pause) I guess the morning would be better. Yeah, let me do tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm scheduling a technician visit for tomorrow, between 8 and 11 AM. Can I just confirm your address and maybe a phone number where we can reach you if there are any delays?

Customer: It's 447 Maple Street, apartment 3B. And my cell is 555-0198.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great. So that's 447 Maple Street, apartment 3B, and we'll call you at 555-0198 if needed. The visit is confirmed for tomorrow morning, 8 to 11 AM. A technician will come assess both your modem and your line connection. In the meantime, I'd recommend keeping your modem powered on so our systems can continue to run diagnostics if possible.

Customer: Okay, so I should just leave it plugged in?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Just leave it as is. That way, if there's anything our network can detect overnight, we'll have that information for the technician when they arrive.

Customer: Alright, I can do that. So... that's it, then? I just wait for tomorrow?

Agent: That's correct. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get it resolved over the phone today, but our technician should be able to identify the issue once they're there. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. You should expect someone tomorrow morning between 8 and 11 AM. If you don't hear from us or if anything changes, feel free to give us a call back. Your confirmation number for this visit is 847593. Do you have that?

Customer: Yeah, 847593.

Agent: Perfect. We really appreciate your patience, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
