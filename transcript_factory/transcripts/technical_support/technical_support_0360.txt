Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging everything and plugging it back in, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I grab your account information first? Can you provide me with your phone number or account number?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got your account here. I see you're in the Denver area. Let me pull up your service details... Alright, so you mentioned you already tried restarting your equipment. When exactly did the internet stop working?

Customer: Um, like I said, about an hour ago. I was just browsing and then everything just froze up and then the connection dropped completely.

Agent: Got it. And right now, can you tell me what you're seeing on your modem and router? Are there any lights on at all?

Customer: Well, the modem has some lights on it. Let me see... there's a power light that's green, but the internet light is red. And then my router is, uh... it's also on but I don't see any internet light on it either.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on, which is good. That red light on the modem typically indicates that it's not getting a signal. Let me check our systems here to see if there are any outages in your area... (typing sounds, pause) Hmm, I'm not seeing any reported outages in your zip code right now. 

Customer: Really? That's weird because everything was working fine this morning.

Agent: Let me try a few things with you. First, I want you to unplug your modem from the power source. Just pull the power cable out completely.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Done.

Agent: Great. Now can you wait about thirty seconds while it completely powers down? Sometimes the modem needs a full reset.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I can do that. (longer pause) Okay, I'm counting... thirty seconds should be up.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Plugged back in. (pause) Okay, I'm watching the lights. The power light came back on... it's green again. And now the internet light is... (pause) ...it's still red.

Agent: Hmm, still red. Okay, that's not ideal. Let me check a couple more things. Can you tell me—is the modem plugged directly into the wall outlet, or is it plugged into a power strip?

Customer: It's, uh... (pause) it's plugged into a power strip that's plugged into the wall.

Agent: Okay, try unplugging it from the power strip and plug it directly into the wall outlet. Sometimes power strips can cause issues.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me do that. (rustling sounds) Unplugging it... (pause) ...and plugging it into the wall now. (pause) Alright, it's powering back on. (longer pause) Okay... power light is green... and... the internet light is still red.

Agent: Still showing red. Okay. Let me check the service lines on your account. (typing sounds) I'm going to look at the connection coming into your house. Can you tell me—do you have a separate modem and router, or do you have a combo unit?

Customer: They're separate. So I've got the modem from you guys and then I have my own router that I bought.

Agent: Got it. So in your setup, the modem should be getting a signal before it sends it to your router. The fact that the modem itself isn't showing internet connection means the issue is likely between your house and our line or at our equipment. 

Customer: Oh. So is it something on your end then?

Agent: Possibly. Let me check your line status in our system. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm looking at your account... (pause) ...and I'm actually not seeing any major flags, but I am seeing that your modem hasn't communicated with our servers in about an hour and fifteen minutes, which aligns with when you lost service.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It could be an issue with the line coming into your house, it could be an issue with the equipment at the street, or in rare cases, it could be the modem itself. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you check the cable coming into your modem? It's usually a thick coaxial cable. Can you make sure it's screwed in tightly on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me look... Okay, I'm looking at it now. The cable that's going into the modem from the wall... (pause) ...it feels pretty tight to me. But let me try loosening it and tightening it again just to be sure. (sounds of unscrewing and screwing) Okay, tightened it back up.

Agent: Good. And do you see any lights on the modem yet?

Customer: (pause) No, still just the power light that's green. The internet light is still red.

Agent: Okay. Um... (pause) ...let me also check—have there been any storms in your area recently? Sometimes weather can affect the lines.

Customer: No, it's been clear all day. Perfect weather, actually.

Agent: Alright. I've tried a few standard troubleshooting steps with you here, but unfortunately we're not getting the modem to reconnect to the network. At this point, I think we might be looking at either a line issue or possibly a problem with the modem itself. 

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: Well, I have a couple of options for you. I can schedule a technician to come out to your house and check the physical line and the equipment. That would probably be the best way to diagnose exactly what's going on. Or, if you'd like, I can also send you a replacement modem to try, but that would take a few days to arrive.

Customer: How long would it take for a technician to come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... We have some openings tomorrow afternoon, or I could get someone out there Thursday morning. Given that it's an outage situation, we'd prioritize that.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be better. What time frame are we talking?

Agent: We typically do a four-hour window. We could do anywhere from noon to four, or two to six. What works better for your schedule?

Customer: Uh, two to six would be better.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to get a technician scheduled for you tomorrow between two and six p.m. You'll receive a confirmation text and email with those details. The technician will bring diagnostic equipment and can test the line, check the modem, and figure out exactly what's going on.

Customer: Okay, great. So I'll have internet back tomorrow?

Agent: Well, the technician will diagnose the issue, and in most cases, yes, they can resolve it on site. But I don't want to promise anything without knowing exactly what the problem is yet. But they'll do everything they can to get you back online.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. Thanks for trying to help troubleshoot.

Agent: Of course. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully the technician can figure it out tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident they will. Your confirmation will come through within the next few minutes. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we'll get you back up and running as soon as we can.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. Appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
