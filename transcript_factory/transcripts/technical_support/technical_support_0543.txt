# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, uh, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's area code 503, 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And your name?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you tried any troubleshooting steps on your end yet, or is this the first time you're reporting it?

Customer: Um, well I tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in, like... I don't know, maybe twenty minutes ago? But nothing changed.

Agent: Okay, that's a good first step. Let me pull up your account here... (pause, typing) Alright, I'm looking at your service. It shows you're on our fiber 500 plan in the Gresham area, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just to clarify—when you say the internet's not working, you're not getting any lights on the modem at all, or are the lights on but you're just not connecting?

Customer: Oh, um... the lights are on. There's like, a blue light and some other ones, but I can't actually connect to anything. Like, my phone won't load pages or anything.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the modem is powered on and the lights are illuminated. Do you see a light that's specifically labeled "internet" or maybe "online"?

Customer: (pause) Let me look closer... there's a blue one at the top, then below that there's like... one that's red? Or maybe orange? I'm not great with these things.

Agent: That's alright. The orange or red light typically indicates there might be a connectivity issue. Let me try something—can you give the modem about 30 seconds and then unplug the power cable from the back?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Unplugging it now.

Agent: Good, and while that's sitting unplugged, let me ask you—have you noticed any storms in your area recently or any physical damage you might be aware of?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been fine all week. This just happened overnight or something.

Agent: Understood. Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready. That should be about 30 seconds from when you unplugged it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in... (pause) It's booting up now. I can see the lights starting to blink.

Agent: Perfect. This usually takes about two to three minutes for the modem to fully restart and re-establish the connection. While we wait, let me check your account for any service alerts or outages in your area. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing any reported outages, so that's good news.

Customer: How long should I wait?

Agent: Give it another minute or so. Are you watching the lights right now?

Customer: Yeah, I am. The blue one's still blinking but that orange one... it's still lit up. It's not blinking or anything, just solid orange.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's... that's not ideal. Usually that solid orange light means the modem isn't syncing with our network properly. Have you tried unplugging the modem before I told you to?

Customer: Well, yeah, I did that like 20 minutes ago like I mentioned. I left it unplugged for maybe a minute, then plugged it back in.

Agent: Right, right. Let me try another approach. Can you check something for me? There should be a cable that goes from the wall into the back of your modem. Can you confirm that's securely connected?

Customer: (sounds of rustling) Oh, actually... let me see. (pause) Hmm, when I wiggle it, the orange light flickers a little bit. Is that... is that the problem?

Agent: That could definitely be part of it. So when you wiggle the cable, the light changes—that suggests there might be a loose connection. Can you try pushing it all the way in as firmly as you can?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that... (pause) There! Wait, did you see something? The orange light just... it went off for a second, now it's back on but it looks maybe a little brighter?

Agent: That's a good sign. Let me check your modem status on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm still not seeing a solid connection coming through. David, can you try disconnecting that cable completely, just for a few seconds, and then reconnecting it again?

Customer: Alright, doing that now. (pause) It's out... and back in... (pause) Okay, the orange light is still there.

Agent: I see. (pause, typing) Alright, I'm going to be honest with you—the fact that the light is responding to the cable movement suggests there might be a physical issue with either the cable itself or the port on the modem. Or it could be something on our end with the connection to your node.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it remotely or...?

Agent: Unfortunately, I'm not able to fix this particular issue remotely. There are a couple of options here. One would be to have a technician come out to your location to check the cable, the connection, and potentially replace the modem if that's what's causing the issue. The other thing we can try is if you have a different coaxial cable at home, you could try swapping it in to see if that resolves it.

Customer: (sighs) Do you have any extra cables there or...?

Agent: You know, I could arrange a technician visit for you. Typically we can get someone out within 24 to 48 hours depending on availability. Would that work for you?

Customer: I really need this fixed today if possible. Can they come today?

Agent: Let me check the schedule for your area. (pause, typing) (pause) I'm showing that we have pretty limited availability today—it looks like we only have a window between 4 and 6 PM. Would that work for your schedule?

Customer: That's... I mean, that might be tight but let me think. Actually, I'm not sure. Can I call back if I need to reschedule?

Agent: Absolutely, we can set it up provisionally and you can always adjust it. But before we go down that route, do you happen to have another coaxial cable anywhere in your house? Sometimes people have old ones from previous equipment.

Customer: (pause) I don't think so... well, I mean, I could look, but I wouldn't even know what to look for.

Agent: It's the cable that screws onto the back of the modem. Thick, with like a connector on each end. Typically gray or black.

Customer: (pause) Honestly, I don't think I have one. We just moved here like six months ago and I... I'm not really a tech person.

Agent: No problem, I understand. In that case, I think the best route is getting a technician out here. Let me set that up for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I can book you for today between 4 and 6 PM. There'll be a $99 service charge if it turns out to be something we can resolve in under an hour, and there's no additional charge if we need to replace equipment. Does that 4 to 6 PM window work?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I mean, I'll make it work. I just really need to get online.

Agent: I completely understand. Before we finalize this, let me try one more thing. I'm going to remotely reboot your modem from our end. This will take about three minutes, and you should see all the lights go off and then come back on. Keep an eye on that orange light, okay?

Customer: Okay, I'm ready.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, initiating the reboot now. (pause) Let me know when you see the lights go dark.

Customer: (pause) It's happening... everything just went dark.

Agent: Good. Now we wait for it to boot back up.

(long pause, background ambient noise)

Customer: Um, the lights are coming back on now...

Agent: Great, and the orange light—is it still orange?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... it's back to solid orange again.

Agent: (sigh) Alright, I was hoping that would clear it, but unfortunately we're back to the same state. At this point, I'm confident there's something on the physical side that needs to be addressed. I do want to get you set up with that technician visit for today if you're ready.

Customer: Yeah, okay, let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. So that's 4 to 6 PM today at your address on file—that's still correct, right?

Customer: Yes, that's the right address.

Agent: (typing) Excellent. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes with all the details and a confirmation number. If you need to reschedule, just call back and reference that confirmation number and we can get you sorted. Is there anything else I can help you with today, David?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just really hope they can fix it today.

Agent: I understand, and I'm confident our technician will be able to get you back online. If for some reason they can't today, they'll let you know what the next steps are. Thanks for choosing Frontier, David, and I apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
