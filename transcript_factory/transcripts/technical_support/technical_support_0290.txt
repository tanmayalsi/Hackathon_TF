Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I'm showing an account for a Mr. James Patterson at 412 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you're experiencing a complete outage? The internet isn't working at all?

Customer: Right, nothing. No lights on the modem, no connection. I tried unplugging it, waiting like five minutes, and plugging it back in. That usually works, but not this time.

Agent: Okay, that's actually a good first step that you already did. Let me have you try something else. Can you check the back of your modem and make sure all the cables are plugged in nice and tight? Sometimes they can wiggle loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, hold on... (background noise of shuffling) Okay, I'm looking at it now. There's the power cable, ethernet cable coming from the wall... (pause) Wait, actually... one second... (more shuffling)

Agent: Take your time.

Customer: Okay, so the ethernet cable that comes from the wall outlet—it looks like it might be a little loose. Let me push it in further... there we go. (pause) Hmm, still nothing though. The modem still doesn't have any lights on it.

Agent: Alright. Let's make sure the power cable is secure as well. Can you check that connection?

Customer: Already did that, yeah. It feels pretty solid. (pause) Should the modem have power lights on all the time, or only when there's internet?

Agent: Great question. It should have at least a power light on constantly, even if there's no internet connection. The fact that you're not seeing any lights tells me there might be a power issue. Can you try plugging the modem into a different outlet? Maybe in a nearby room?

Customer: Uh, sure. Give me a second. (pause, background noise of movement) Okay, I found another outlet in the hallway. (pause) Plugging it in... (pause) Still nothing. No lights at all.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I think we might be looking at a power issue with the modem itself. When's the last time you restarted it before this morning?

Customer: Honestly, I don't know. Weeks, maybe? It just sits there and works, so I usually leave it alone.

Agent: That's pretty normal. Um, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any service outages in your area right now, which is good news and bad news. The good news is it's probably not something happening on our end. The bad news is it's likely the modem hardware itself that's having an issue.

Customer: So it's dead? The modem's just... broken?

Agent: Well, I don't want to say for certain it's dead, but it does seem like there's a power issue. Before we jump to replacing it, let me ask—do you have a different power cable anywhere? Maybe from an old phone charger or something? We could try swapping it out just to rule that out.

Customer: (pause) Uh, I might have something. Let me look... (background noise) Okay, I'm checking my junk drawer here... I don't think I have one that would fit. These are all USB or the little round connector things.

Agent: Yeah, those won't work. The modem uses a specific connection. Okay, so here's where we're at. I've had you try two different outlets, you've checked all the cable connections, and the modem isn't showing any power indicators. That really does point to either the power adapter failing or an internal issue with the modem itself.

Customer: Can you send me a replacement? How long would that take?

Agent: We can definitely do that. Let me just try one more thing before we go down that road. Can you hold for just a moment? I want to check our system to see if we can remotely reset anything on our end.

Customer: Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

Agent: (pause, hold music plays briefly) Okay, I'm back. So I've done a remote reset on our side, but since the modem has no power, it wouldn't have any effect anyway. (pause) I think we need to get you a replacement unit. How soon do you need internet back up and running?

Customer: I mean, ideally today? I've got a work call this afternoon and I really need to be online.

Agent: (typing sounds) I understand. Unfortunately, our next available appointment for a technician to drop off equipment would be tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work with your schedule?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't you just ship one to me overnight or something?

Agent: (pause) Normally we'd offer that, but given that you need it today... I'm sorry, I really don't have an option for same-day delivery. The technician appointment is really the fastest way to get you back online at this point.

Customer: (frustrated) This is... I can't believe this. So basically I just have no internet until tomorrow?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry we can't get it faster. Is there anything else you need to try before we schedule that appointment? Do you have maybe a smartphone with a hotspot you could use for your work call?

Customer: I mean, I guess I could do that, but it's not ideal. My data plan isn't very big. (pause) Okay, fine. Let's schedule the appointment for tomorrow.

Agent: Alright, let me get that set up for you. I'm showing tomorrow, that's Tuesday, between 8 AM and noon. Will someone be home to receive the new modem?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. Is the address still 412 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation email and text within the next few minutes. The technician will just need to swap out your modem and make sure everything's connected properly. Should only take about 15 minutes or so.

Customer: Okay. And I'll definitely have internet after that?

Agent: (pause) Yes, assuming the new modem powers on and connects properly, which it should. If for any reason you have issues tomorrow, you can call us right back.

Customer: (sighs) Alright. Well, thanks, I guess.

Agent: I know this isn't the resolution you were hoping for, but we'll get you back online tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's... that's all. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. And again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
