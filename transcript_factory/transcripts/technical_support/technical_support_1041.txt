Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went down this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Scottsdale area. So your internet went down this morning... Do you remember if there was a power outage or anything like that in your area?

Customer: No, no power outage or anything. Everything else is working fine. The lights are on, my TV is on. It's just the internet that's not working.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what you're seeing? Like, is the modem showing any lights at all?

Customer: Um... (pause) yeah, it's got some lights on it. There's like a green one and then there's a red one that's blinking.

Agent: Okay, so we've got a green light and a red blinking light. The red light typically indicates an issue with the connection. Let me ask you this—did you restart the modem this morning at all?

Customer: No, I didn't. I didn't think about that. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Let's try that. Go ahead and unplug the modem from the power cable. Just pull it out completely.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now, let's wait about thirty seconds. This helps clear the modem's memory. (pause) Go ahead and count down for me while we wait, or just let me know when thirty seconds is up.

Customer: Okay... (long pause) ...and... now?

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (plugging sound) Done. Okay, it's plugging back in. I can see the lights are... they're kind of doing their thing, flashing and stuff.

Agent: Good, that's normal. When you restart a modem, it takes about a minute or two to fully boot back up. Why don't we give it about a minute and then we can check if you have internet again. Do you have a computer or phone nearby where you can test the connection?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my laptop right here. I can try to open a website or something.

Agent: Perfect. Just wait for the modem to finish restarting... (pause) Okay, go ahead and try now. Just open up your browser and go to any website. Google, Facebook, whatever you prefer.

Customer: (typing sounds) Um... (pause) still nothing. It's still loading. No, it's not loading. I'm not getting anything.

Agent: Okay, no worries. Let's check a couple more things. When you look at the modem now, what lights are you seeing?

Customer: The green light is on, but I still see that red blinking light.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That red light is still concerning. Let me check a couple things on my end here. (typing sounds) Let me see if there's any service alerts in your area... No, I'm not showing anything active right now.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It means there's nothing going on network-wide that would be causing this. It looks like it might be something specific to your line. Can you do me a favor and check your cable connections? Is the coaxial cable—that's the thick cable that connects to your modem—is it screwed in tight?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks pretty tight. It's screwed in.

Agent: Okay, good. And you just have the one cable coming in?

Customer: Yeah, just one coming into the modem.

Agent: Perfect. Let me try something else here. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem from my end. This might take a minute. Just stand by. (typing sounds, long pause) Okay, I've sent that signal. Your modem should restart automatically here in just a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. Yeah, the lights are flashing again.

Agent: Great. Give it about another minute to boot back up, and then try the internet again. Go ahead.

Customer: (pause) (typing sounds) Nope. Still nothing. The page isn't loading. [inaudible] this is ridiculous.

Agent: I understand your frustration, James. I really do. Unfortunately, at this point, it sounds like there may be an issue with either the line coming into your home or potentially an issue with the modem itself. I have a couple more options. I can schedule a technician to come out to your place and diagnose the issue. They can check all the physical connections and equipment.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone get out here?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) The earliest we have available is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. We also have an opening on Friday afternoon between 1 PM and 5 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works, I guess. But I really need this fixed today if possible. Isn't there anything else we can try?

Agent: I wish I had another option for you today, James. Believe me. Without seeing the physical equipment and the line, it's really hard for me to determine exactly what's going on. The technician will be able to test everything and get you back up and running.

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, okay. Let's do tomorrow morning then.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to go ahead and schedule that for you tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. You should receive a confirmation call about 24 hours before the appointment, just to confirm the time works for you. Is there a good number to reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, the same number you called me at.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap, you've got a technician visit scheduled for tomorrow morning, 8 AM to 12 PM. We'll have someone come out and investigate the issue with your internet connection. In the meantime, if anything changes or if it somehow comes back on, just give us a call back and let us know.

Customer: Okay, will do. And will there be a charge for the technician visit?

Agent: Since we weren't able to resolve this through troubleshooting and this is our first service visit for this issue, there won't be any charge for the technician visit itself. If it turns out to be something like equipment damage that's not covered under your service agreement, we'd discuss that with you, but typically there's no charge.

Customer: Alright, that's good to know. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, James. I really am sorry we couldn't get you back online today. Our technician will take great care of you tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it. I just hope this gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident it will be. We really appreciate your business with Frontier, and we'll have you back online as soon as we can. Have a good rest of your day, James.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Take care.
