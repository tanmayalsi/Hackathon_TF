# Frontier Communications - Customer Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out and I have no idea what's going on. I need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'm gonna do everything I can to help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up right now. And can I also get your name, please?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Thanks for that. I'm looking at your account here... So I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Phoenix area. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. And when exactly did you notice the internet go out?

Customer: Maybe like... fifteen, twenty minutes ago? I was working from home and all of a sudden, nothing. The WiFi just died.

Agent: Okay. Before we dive into troubleshooting, let me check if there's any service disruption in your area. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any reported outages at this time in your neighborhood, so that's actually a good sign. It's likely something we can resolve on your end.

Customer: Okay, that's... that's good, I guess.

Agent: So the first thing I want you to do is look at your modem. Do you have a Frontier-provided modem, or did you supply your own?

Customer: I... I think it's the one you guys provided. It's white and kinda rectangular, if that helps.

Agent: (chuckles) That sounds like ours. Perfect. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on the front of it right now?

Customer: Um, let me look. So I see... there's a power light that's on, I think. The light's green. But um... (pause) I don't see the internet light or whatever. That one looks like it's off.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is green, which is good. And the internet light is off—that's the one we need to fix. Those lights tell us a lot. Can you also look at the lights on the back or the side of the modem? There might be port lights there.

Customer: Yeah, I see some. They're all kind of... dark? I don't think anything's lit up back there.

Agent: Got it. Alright, David, here's what we're gonna do. I want you to unplug the modem from the power source. Just give it a few seconds, and then plug it back in. That often resolves these kinds of issues.

Customer: Sure, hold on. (pause) (sounds of plugging/unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Give it about ten seconds, and then go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay... it's lighting up. The power light's green again.

Agent: Excellent. Now let's give it a minute to fully boot up. While we're waiting, do you see any lights starting to come on? The internet light should turn on in a few seconds.

Customer: (pause) Um... yeah, I see some lights coming on now. There's like a white light or something... and... hmm. I don't know if that's the internet light. It's kind of hard to tell with all these lights.

Agent: I hear you. Those modems have a few lights. The main one we're looking for should be labeled something like "internet" or "online." Does it say that?

Customer: (pause) Let me look closer. Yeah, okay, I see it. It says "internet" on this one. And it's... it's still off, I think? Or maybe it's blinking? It's doing something, but it's not solid green.

Agent: Okay, so if it's blinking, that's actually normal during the startup process. It's trying to connect. Just give it another minute or so.

Customer: (pause) Okay. I'm just sitting here looking at it. (pause) Still blinking. (pause) Yeah, still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Alright. How long has it been since you plugged it back in? About a minute?

Customer: Yeah, about that.

Agent: Okay. Sometimes it can take a little longer. Let's give it another thirty seconds or so. In the meantime, I'm gonna look at a few things on my end here. Have you noticed any other issues with the modem recently? Any strange noises or anything like that?

Customer: No, not really. It's been working fine up until this.

Agent: That's good. And has your power been stable? Any power surges or blackouts in your area recently?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of, no.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright. Let me also check if there's a backup battery or anything running on the modem. Sometimes that can affect things. (pause) Okay, David, can you check if the internet light is still blinking?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... it's still blinking actually. It's been like thirty seconds or more.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. It shouldn't take this long. Let me try something else. I want you to do a factory reset on the modem. There should be a small reset button on the back—it might be recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something thin to press it.

Customer: Uh, yeah, okay. Let me find it. (pause) I think I see it. There's a little hole back here. Is that it?

Agent: That sounds right. Okay, I'm warning you now—when you press that, the modem is going to reset to factory settings, which means it'll take a few minutes to boot back up and reconnect. Are you ready to do that?

Customer: Yeah, let's do it. I need my internet back.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and hold it down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it down... (pause) Alright, I let it go. The lights are all going crazy now.

Agent: That's exactly what we want to see. The reset is in progress. Now just give the modem about three to five minutes to fully restart and reconnect to our network. Sometimes it can take a bit.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Should I try to connect on my computer or anything?

Agent: Not yet. Let's wait for the modem to finish booting up. Once it's done, that internet light should be solid green, and then we'll see if you're back online. While we wait, let me ask you a quick question—when you get back online, are you gonna be able to test the connection for me? Maybe run a speed test or something?

Customer: Yeah, I can do that. I have my laptop right here.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, let's check back in about three minutes. How are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Um, they've calmed down a bit. Most of them are off now except for the power light. The internet light is... I don't see it lighting up yet.

Agent: That's okay. It's still booting. Give it another minute or two.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, so... (pause) I'm still waiting. (pause) Still nothing on the internet light.

Agent: Still blinking or still completely off?

Customer: It's completely off now. It's not even blinking.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, that's... that's not ideal. Let me ask you—is there a coaxial cable running into the modem? It's the thick cable with the metal connector.

Customer: Yes, I see it. It's plugged in back here.

Agent: Okay, good. Can you check to see if it's firmly connected? Maybe give it a gentle tug to make sure it's tight.

Customer: (pause) It seems pretty tight, but let me... yeah, I'm giving it a little push to make sure. I think it's secure.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm, your router or WiFi device is powered on as well, right?

Customer: Oh, um... I'm not sure if I have a separate router. Is that different from the modem?

Agent: Good question. So your modem is the device we've been working with. A router is typically a separate device that broadcasts the WiFi signal. Some of our Frontier modems have a built-in router, so you might only have one device. But let me ask—are you getting a WiFi signal on your phone or laptop right now?

Customer: (pause) No, I'm not. The WiFi networks... they're not showing up.

Agent: Okay. That actually tells me that the modem likely hasn't fully connected yet, or there's still an issue. Let me check something on my end real quick. (typing sounds) (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, David, I'm not seeing your modem connecting to our network on my end. That's the core issue. The modem isn't establishing a connection with our infrastructure.

Customer: So... what does that mean? What do we do?

Agent: Well, let me try a couple more things. When you look at the modem right now, are there any other lights that are lit up? Any amber or red lights at all?

Customer: (pause) Um, no. Just the green power light. Everything else is dark.

Agent: Alright. Let me have you unplug the coaxial cable from the back of the modem for about thirty seconds. That sometimes helps.

Customer: Okay. (pause) (sounds of unplugging) Alright, it's unplugged. (pause) (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) The modem is still on.

Agent: Good. Let's wait another minute and see if any lights come back.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, I'm looking at it. Still just the green power light.

Agent: (pause) Alright, David, I've tried several of the basic troubleshooting steps here, and I'm not seeing the modem connecting on our backend system either. Unfortunately, this is pointing to either a hardware issue with the modem itself or a potential line issue from our network to your location. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to your place to do a proper diagnosis.

Customer: (sighs) Okay... so how long would that take?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability in your area. (pause) I can get someone out there as early as tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? Yeah, I mean, I guess so. I need the internet though. Is there any way to get someone faster? Like today?

Agent: Let me see if there's anything available today. (pause) Unfortunately, it looks like our technicians are fully booked for the rest of today in your area. But tomorrow morning is the earliest we have. I apologize for that.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Tomorrow morning is fine, I guess. Just... I really need this working. I'm working from home.

Agent: I completely understand. I wish I had better news for you right now. Let me get you set up for that technician visit. The appointment will be tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Do you have a callback number where we can reach you if the technician needs to get in touch?

Customer: It's the same number on the account, 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. And just to set expectations, the technician will likely bring a replacement modem if it turns out to be a hardware issue, or they might find an issue with the line itself. Either way, they should be able to get you back up and running.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything I should do tonight or before they get there?

Agent: Just try to keep the modem powered on so we can monitor it on our end. And have your account information ready when the technician arrives. Other than that, I think we've done everything we can for now remotely.

Customer: Okay. Well, I guess that's it then. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone, David. I know this is frustrating. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for your patience, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible. Have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
