# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've got no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm looking at that now. Okay, so I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Riverside area. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. Everything was working fine yesterday, and then this morning I woke up and just... nothing. No internet at all.

Agent: Okay, understood. So when you say no internet, are you able to see if your modem is powered on? Is there any lights on the device?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, actually, let me look at it. It's on the table right here. So I'm looking at it and... the lights are on. There's like a blue light and... yeah, the power light is on, but I think the internet light might be... it's not lighting up? Or it's red maybe?

Agent: Okay, so we're getting somewhere. If the internet light is red, that usually means we're not getting a good connection. Let me ask you a few questions. First, did anything change yesterday? Did you move the modem, restart it, or install any new equipment?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been sitting in the same spot for like six months. I didn't touch anything.

Agent: Got it. Alright, and just to rule out the basics—have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in? Give it about thirty seconds while it's unplugged?

Customer: Oh, no, I haven't tried that yet. Let me do that right now. (pause) Okay, unplugging it.

Agent: Perfect. So while that's powering down, I'm gonna let you know that I'm also gonna check a few things on our end. Can you give me just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I'm checking our system here and I'm not seeing any outages in your area, so that's good news. How much time has passed on that modem?

Customer: Um, probably like fifteen, twenty seconds?

Agent: Good, go ahead and plug it back in and let's see what happens. It might take a minute or two to fully boot up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm plugging it back in now. (pause) Alright, so... the lights are coming back on. There's the power light, and I see... (pause) okay, the blue light is on again but that red light is still there.

Agent: Still red?

Customer: Yeah, still red.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try something else. Can you tell me what model modem you have? There should be a label on the front or back.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me... (background noise) It says "Frontier Quantum Gateway." Is that right?

Agent: Yes, that's one of our models. Good. So with that model, sometimes we need to reboot it manually using the reset button. There should be a small button on the back. Do you see that?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I see it. It's tiny. Do I just press it?

Agent: Actually, hold on. Before we do that, let me make sure that's the right step. (typing sounds) What I want you to do is press and hold that button for about ten seconds. That should do a full reboot of the modem. Ready?

Customer: Yeah, I'm holding it. (pause) How long?

Agent: Keep holding for about... five more seconds. (pause) Okay, you can let go now.

Customer: (pause) Okay. So it's doing something. The lights are all going dark and... okay, they're coming back on.

Agent: Great, that's normal. So we're gonna wait about two to three minutes for it to fully boot up and stabilize. While we do that, let me ask you—do you have any other devices connected to the internet right now? Your computer, phone, anything like that nearby?

Customer: Um, yeah, my phone is connected to the WiFi. Or... wait, it was. I think it disconnected when we reset it.

Agent: That's perfectly normal. It should reconnect once everything is back online. How's that modem looking now? Any change in the lights?

Customer: (pause) Let me see... the blue light is on, and... (pause) the red light is still there. It's not changing.

Agent: Still red. Okay, that's not ideal. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds, longer pause) Hmm, I'm seeing that we do have a signal coming from your modem, but it's quite weak. That could indicate an issue with the line itself. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, there could be a few things. It could be something with the fiber line coming into your house, or possibly an issue with our equipment at the street level. Unfortunately, from here in the call center, I can't physically diagnose that. But let me try one more thing first. Are you familiar with your router at all?

Customer: Um, not really. I mean, I know I have one, but I don't really mess with it.

Agent: That's okay. Is it in the same location as the modem?

Customer: It's like two feet away. Right on the same table.

Agent: Okay, and do you see any lights on that router?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there are lights on it too. I see like... green and amber or orange?

Agent: And is the amber light steady or is it blinking?

Customer: It's blinking. It keeps blinking.

Agent: Okay, so that blinking light indicates the router is also having trouble maintaining a connection. This is all pointing to the same issue. The modem is getting a weak signal from our network. At this point, I think what we're looking at is... (pause) have you had any work done in your area recently? Construction, anything like that?

Customer: Not that I know of, no.

Agent: Alright. I want to try one more troubleshooting step. I'm gonna send a signal reset to your modem from our end. Just give me one second. (typing sounds) Okay, sending that now. It should take a few moments to process.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm waiting.

Agent: (pause) Do you see any change?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't think so. The lights look the same.

Agent: (pause, sighs) Okay, I'm not seeing the confirmation on my end that the reset completed successfully. That actually tells me we might have a more serious issue with the line connection itself. 

Customer: So... what does that mean? Does that mean I'm stuck without internet?

Agent: No, no, not permanently. But I think at this point, we're going to need to send a technician out to your location to check the fiber line and the connection box at your home. They can verify that everything is properly installed and connected.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) We have availability for a technician visit. The earliest we could get someone out is... it looks like tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have another slot on Thursday morning if that doesn't work for you.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. That's fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm gonna set that up for you. You should receive a confirmation email and a text message shortly with the technician's details and they'll have a two-hour window. Is the phone number on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. I have that scheduled for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM, at your Riverside address. I want to apologize that we couldn't resolve this over the phone today. Unfortunately, sometimes these issues require hands-on inspection.

Customer: I understand. So there's nothing else I can try tonight?

Agent: I'm sorry, but at this point, anything else would just be repeating what we've already done. The issue appears to be with the line infrastructure rather than your equipment. The technician will be able to diagnose it properly.

Customer: Alright, well, I appreciate you trying. I guess I'll see what happens tomorrow.

Agent: Absolutely. Again, my apologies for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications. Your ticket number is 847392 if you need to reference this call. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
