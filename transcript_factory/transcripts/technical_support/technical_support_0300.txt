Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried basically everything I can think of. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your phone number or account number?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan in the Dayton area. And you're saying the internet's completely down?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. My router's lit up like normal, but I can't get anything to load. I've restarted it like three times already.

Agent: Alright, I appreciate you already trying that. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you able to see the WiFi network showing up on your devices?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually. The network shows up, but when I try to connect to anything, nothing happens. It just won't load.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So you're able to see and connect to the network, but no data is going through. Let me have you try something for me. Can you unplug the modem—not the router, the modem—and leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds?

Customer: The modem? Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Just leave it like that for about 30 seconds while we talk. In the meantime, have you noticed any outages in your area that you're aware of?

Customer: No, not that I've heard about. I mean, my neighbor said his internet was fine when I checked with him this morning, so I don't think it's an outage.

Agent: That's good to know. Alright, go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Plugging it back in. (pause) I see the lights coming back on...

Agent: Great. Give it about a minute to fully boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me when this started exactly? Was it this morning when you woke up?

Customer: Yeah, I'd say around 8 or 8:30 this morning. I got up, tried to check my email, and nothing was working. I tried resetting things, and that's when I realized the internet was completely out.

Agent: Okay, so this was pretty sudden. Did you experience any storms last night or this morning? Sometimes that can affect the line.

Customer: No, actually it's been clear all day. That's why I'm so confused.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, let me just pull up... (pause) Okay, on my end I'm not seeing any alerts or outages in your area right now. But let me check something. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on the modem right now?

Customer: Um, there's a green light on the top that says Power. There's another light that's blinking orange. And there's a couple others that are either off or... I'm not sure.

Agent: The blinking orange light—that's typically indicating that it's still booting up. Let's give it another 30 seconds or so. In the meantime, can you do me a favor and check if any cables are loose? There's usually a cable going into the modem from the wall and then another going to the router.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it. The one from the wall seems pretty secure. Let me check the other one. (pause) The router cable looks fine too.

Agent: Okay, good. Sometimes we forget about those. Alright, what are you seeing on the modem now?

Customer: Um, the orange light is still blinking. It's been like, what, a minute now?

Agent: It can take a couple minutes sometimes. Let's just wait another... (pause) What does it say on the front of the modem? Do you see any model number or—

Customer: It says... FiberMax 3000 or something like that?

Agent: Okay, FiberMax 3000. That's one of our standard units. Alright, let me try accessing your modem remotely if that's okay. I can run a diagnostic on it from here.

Customer: Yeah, go ahead.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm attempting to access the device. (pause) Hmm, okay. I'm not getting a connection. Let me try again. (pause) Yeah, I'm still unable to establish a remote connection to your modem. That usually means either the modem isn't fully synced with our network yet, or there might be a connectivity issue on the line itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it broken?

Agent: Not necessarily. It could just mean the modem is still initializing. But it's been a few minutes now, so let's try a different approach. Can you do a factory reset? There should be a small button on the back of the modem. You'll need to press and hold it for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. It's a really small button on the back. Pressing it now. (pause) How long do I hold it?

Agent: About 10 seconds. Just... count to 10 while you hold it down.

Customer: (pause) Okay, 10 seconds. (pause) I'm letting go. Now what?

Agent: Now we wait for it to fully reset and reboot. This will take a couple minutes. While that's happening, let me check the line status from our end. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up the diagnostics for your address. (pause) Huh.

Customer: What? Is something wrong?

Agent: Well, I'm seeing some signal degradation on the line. Nothing that would typically cause a complete outage, but it's... it's lower than it should be. When was the last time you had a technician out at your home?

Customer: I don't know, maybe... a year ago? When we first got the service set up.

Agent: Alright. Well, that could be part of it. Sometimes the connection at the splice point or the fiber line can degrade over time. Are you seeing the modem lights doing anything different now?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually. More lights are lit up now. There's still the blinking orange one, but now there's a blue light and a green light that are solid. Is that... is that better?

Agent: The blue light is actually good—that typically means it's connected to our network. But that orange light shouldn't still be blinking at this point. (pause) Let me try accessing the modem again. (typing sounds) (pause) Still not connecting from my end. 

Customer: This is really frustrating. I have work I need to do today.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Um, here's what I'm thinking. I've tried a few basic troubleshooting steps, and the modem itself should be responding to my diagnostics but it's not. Combined with that signal degradation I'm seeing on the line, I think we might have a hardware issue with either the modem or potentially a problem with the fiber connection itself.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: I think at this point, we need to get a technician out to your address to investigate further. They'll be able to test the line, check all the connections, and determine if it's the modem that needs replacing or if there's an issue with the infrastructure.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) The earliest I can get someone out is... it looks like tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sighs) Tomorrow? I really need it fixed today.

Agent: I know, and I wish I had something available today. We did have a technician in your area this morning, but all appointments for today are booked. I'd be happy to put you on a waiting list in case something opens up, but I can't guarantee anything.

Customer: Yeah, yeah, okay. Put me on the waiting list. But also schedule me for tomorrow just in case?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that set up for you. So I have you down for the waiting list for today, and I'll get you scheduled for tomorrow, January 15th, between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will call you 30 minutes before they arrive. Does that number 555-0147 still work for them to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's the number they can call.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess... I just hope you guys can figure this out tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sure our technicians will be able to get to the bottom of it. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve it over the phone today. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll get someone out to you tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
