# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and router but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. Let me pull up your account here. And your name is...?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see you're on our 500 megabit fiber plan in the Riverside area. So you mentioned you already unplugged the modem and router?

Customer: Yeah, I did that right away. Waited like five minutes before plugging them back in, which is what I've always been told to do.

Agent: That's exactly right. Okay, so after you plugged them back in, did you see the lights come back on?

Customer: Um, yeah, the modem's got some lights on it. There's like... a green one and a red one, I think? But I'm not totally sure what they're supposed to look like.

Agent: (pause) Okay, no problem. Let me walk you through this. Can you look at the modem right now? It should be a white box, probably about so big... (gestures) well, you know, roughly rectangular.

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it. It's got all these little lights on the front.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to need you to tell me which lights are on and what color they are. Start from the left.

Customer: Okay, um... there's a green light that says "Power," that one's solid green. Then there's one that's... oh, this one's red. It says "Internet" I think?

Agent: Okay, so the Internet light is red. That's actually the issue we're seeing. That light should be green when you have a good connection. Have you had any outages in your area recently, or any weather issues?

Customer: Well, it was raining pretty hard this morning, but it stopped like an hour ago. That's around when the internet went out, actually.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our system here for any reported outages in your area. (pause) I'm not seeing any active outages at the moment, but we may have had some weather-related issues. Let me try a few more things with you. Can you unplug the modem again, but this time keep it unplugged for about thirty seconds?

Customer: Sure, hold on. (rustling sounds) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we wait, let me ask—are you getting any error messages on your computer or phone?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I just tried to open a website and it said it couldn't connect. My WiFi shows up but then it won't actually load anything.

Agent: Understood. Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) (plugging sounds) Okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Alright, this usually takes about two to three minutes for the modem to fully boot up and reestablish the connection. While we wait, let me just verify—your router is also plugged in and turned on?

Customer: Yeah, it's right next to the modem. The lights are all... (pause) ...actually, one of the lights just turned off on the router. Is that normal?

Agent: It might be rebooting along with the modem. They can communicate with each other. Just give it another minute or so. Is there anything else I should know about? Any recent storms, power outages, anything like that?

Customer: Well, actually, yeah. Last week during that storm we had, my power went out for like ten minutes. But the internet came back fine after that, so I didn't think it was related.

Agent: That could potentially be it. Sometimes power surges can affect equipment. But let's see if the modem recovers here. (pause) How are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the Power light is still green, and the Internet light is... still red. It's not changing.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's not what we want to see. Let me try a different approach. Can you look on the back of the modem? I'm going to have you perform what we call a factory reset.

Customer: Oh, um... is that going to mess anything up?

Agent: It shouldn't affect anything permanently. It will just restore the modem to its default settings, and we can reconfigure it. There should be a small button on the back—it might be recessed, so you might need a pen or a paperclip to press it.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's got a little hole.

Agent: Perfect. Now, I want you to hold that button down for about ten seconds while the modem is powered on. Ready?

Customer: Yeah, I'm ready. (pause) Okay, holding it down. (pause) How long should this take?

Agent: Just a few more seconds... and you can release it now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, released it. Now what?

Agent: Now the modem's going to reboot. This might take a couple of minutes. The lights might flash and do some different things—that's totally normal. Let me pull some information while we wait. Have you noticed any other issues with your service recently? Any slowness or drops?

Customer: No, it's been working fine until today. Just suddenly went out.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at our notes here, and I'm showing that we've had some weather events reported in your neighborhood. Is it still raining where you are?

Customer: No, like I said, it stopped about an hour ago. That's when it went out.

Agent: Right, right. Sometimes the equipment takes a little time to recover. Okay, um, what are the lights looking like now?

Customer: Still the same. Green power light, red internet light.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me try to reach out to our network operations center here to see if there's anything on the line side that might be causing this. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays) (after about 45 seconds) Thanks for holding, James. Okay, so I've checked with our team and we're not seeing any issues with your line from our end. The signal is reaching your equipment, which tells me the problem is with the modem itself or the connection between your modem and the line.

Customer: So like... is the modem broken?

Agent: It's possible. You mentioned you had a power surge about a week ago. That can sometimes damage equipment over time. Let me try one more thing. I'm going to reboot your modem remotely from here and see if that helps. This will take your internet down for about a minute, but it might help reset the connection.

Customer: Okay, go ahead.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, restarting now. Give it about ninety seconds and let's see what happens with those lights.

Customer: (pause) (pause) Okay... the green light's still green, but the red light's still red.

Agent: (sigh) Yeah, I'm not seeing any change from our end either, unfortunately. At this point, I think the modem itself may have been damaged. It's not recovering properly, and we're not able to establish the connection.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can I get a new one?

Agent: Absolutely. I can arrange a replacement modem for you. It'll be shipped out to you within 1-2 business days. I'll expedite it since you're without service. In the meantime, if you have a mobile phone, you could potentially use your cellular data or find a hotspot.

Customer: How much is a new modem going to cost me?

Agent: Well, the good news is that if this is equipment failure and not your fault, we'll replace it at no charge. However, because of the power surge damage, this might be considered outside our standard warranty. Let me see what I can do for you. (typing sounds) You know what, James, I'm going to go ahead and send you a replacement unit at no charge. We want to make this right for you.

Customer: Really? Okay, that's great. How long did you say it would take?

Agent: 1-2 business days, and I'm marking it as priority. You should see it by Friday at the latest. Once you get it, you can just unbox it, plug it in the same way you had the old one, and it should work right out of the box. If you have any issues when it arrives, just give us a call back.

Customer: Alright, thank you. I appreciate that.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. When I get the modem and plug it in, hopefully that'll solve it.

Agent: I hope so too. Again, I'm really sorry for the inconvenience today. We'll get this sorted out for you. Your reference number for this ticket is 447829. You can use that if you need to call back. Thanks so much for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day.

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
