Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you taken care of. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm seeing your account for 2847 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Okay, so you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Can you tell me... did anything change before it went down? Like, did you restart your router, or was there a storm or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I was just using it fine yesterday, and then I got up this morning and, uh, nothing. The router's just... it's not doing anything.

Agent: Alright, let's start with the basics then. Can you tell me what you're seeing on the router right now? Are there any lights on at all?

Customer: Um, yeah, there's... let me look. Okay, so the power light is on—that's the green one—but the internet light, I think it's supposed to be blue or something? It's not on.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the power's on but no internet light. That usually means the router's not connecting to the modem. Do you have a separate modem, or is it all one unit?

Customer: I think it's separate? I don't know, I'm not really tech-savvy with this stuff. (pause) There's like a box, and then there's the router thing.

Agent: No problem, no problem. That's what I'm here for. So there's definitely two separate units then. Can you go check on that other box—the modem—and tell me what color lights you see on that one?

Customer: (background noise, sounds of movement) Okay, hold on, it's in the hallway. Um... (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it. It's got... the power light is green, and then there's some other lights but they're all... they're all red or orange or something. They're not green.

Agent: Alright, so we're getting somewhere. Red or orange lights typically indicate an error status. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While that's unplugged, go ahead and unplug the router too. The wifi router.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about thirty seconds just to let everything reset. (pause) And while we're waiting, I'm also noticing here that... let me see... it looks like we should have service on your line. I'm not seeing any outages in your area on my end.

Customer: So like, it should be working?

Agent: Theoretically, yes. But let's finish getting these devices reset and we'll see where we're at. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged in.

Agent: Good. Now, while that's booting back up, why don't you plug the router back in as well.

Customer: (pause) Alright, router's in.

Agent: Awesome. This usually takes about a minute or so for everything to fully boot up and connect. While we wait, can you tell me—have you had any issues with your service recently? Any slowness or disconnections?

Customer: No, it's been pretty solid. This is just... sudden.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. (typing sounds) So, uh, I'm looking at your modem here in our system and I'm actually seeing something a little unusual. It looks like the modem might not be syncing properly with our network. Have you noticed any changes to the cables going into the modem? Like, are they all plugged in pretty firmly?

Customer: (background noise) Let me look... Yeah, I see the cables. There's like a cord coming from the wall and then it goes into the modem, and then there's another one going to the router. They look... I don't know, they look fine to me?

Agent: That's good. Can you follow the one coming from the wall and just make sure it's firmly connected? Sometimes they get jostled loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I checked it. It seems pretty tight to me.

Agent: Alright, and do you have any other devices connected to the modem? Any cable boxes or phone units or anything?

Customer: Um, no. Just the router and the modem.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let me check the lights on the modem again. What are we seeing now?

Customer: Um... the power's still green, but the other lights are still red and orange. They haven't changed.

Agent: They haven't changed? (typing sounds) Okay, hmm. Let me try something else. I'm going to have you do a factory reset on the modem. To do that, there should be a small reset button, usually recessed into the back of the modem. Do you see that?

Customer: (background noise) Um, I'm looking... I see a bunch of ports and cables and stuff, but I'm not sure... there's like a tiny hole?

Agent: That's probably it. You might need a paperclip or something thin to press it. It's recessed so you can't just press it with your finger.

Customer: Oh, okay, um... (pause, sounds of rummaging) Let me find something... (pause) Okay, I've got a pen. Will that work?

Agent: A pen should work fine. Go ahead and just press that button and hold it for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Okay, I'm holding it... (pause) Still holding... (pause) Okay, let go?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and let go. Now it's going to restart and reinitialize. This could take a couple minutes. Why don't we just stay on the line?

Customer: Sure. (pause) So like, how much longer do you think this will take to fix?

Agent: Well, it depends. We're just trying to get the modem to reset and reconnect. If it's a hardware issue, that could be a different story. But let's see what happens here. (pause) I'm actually going to put you on a brief hold while I check something on the back end. Is that okay?

Customer: Uh, yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music playing) Thank you for your patience.

(pause, hold music continues)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. Sorry about that. I was just checking the lines in your area. So I'm not seeing any outages on my end, which is good. How are those lights looking now on the modem?

Customer: They're... they're still doing the same thing. Still red and orange.

Agent: Still the same? (pause) Okay. Let me think about this. (typing sounds) You know what, um... (pause) So I've tried a few standard troubleshooting steps with you and the modem just isn't syncing with our network. At this point, I think we might be dealing with a hardware issue with the modem itself.

Customer: So like... what does that mean?

Agent: It means the modem might be failing internally. When that happens, it usually can't establish a connection with our network, which is why you're not seeing any lights change. Um, let me check something real quick. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account and your modem—it looks like it's been with us for about... four years now?

Customer: I mean, I guess? I'm not sure. I just got it when I signed up.

Agent: Right, yeah. So modems typically have a lifespan of around five to seven years, but sometimes they fail earlier. Given what we're seeing here, I think we're probably looking at a modem replacement.

Customer: Oh, so I need a new one?

Agent: Yeah, it looks that way. Now, I can go ahead and ship you out a replacement modem today. It should arrive within three to five business days, depending on your location. In the meantime, unfortunately, you won't have internet service.

Customer: Three to five days? That's... that's a long time. I have work I need to do. Can't you guys come out and like, bring one or something?

Agent: Let me see if we have any expedited shipping options available. (pause, typing sounds) Unfortunately, looking at the options available for your address, I'm not seeing anything faster than the standard three to five business days for a replacement modem. We do have some customers who are able to pick them up at local Frontier locations, but let me check if that's available in your area. (pause, typing sounds) [inaudible] ...yeah, there is a Frontier location about fifteen minutes from you. You could potentially go pick one up today or tomorrow if you wanted to do that.

Customer: Oh, really? Where is it?

Agent: It's at 412 Commerce Drive. It's open until 6 PM today if you want to head over there. Otherwise, they open at 9 AM tomorrow morning.

Customer: Okay, um... I might be able to do that. But do I need like, an appointment or something?

Agent: No appointment necessary. You can just walk in. I'll need to put a note on your account that you're coming to pick up a modem. Can you give me your name?

Customer: It's James. James Patterson.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, James, I've added a note here. When you go in, just give them your account number, which is 555-0147, and they'll have a modem ready for you. Now, when you get the modem, the installation is pretty straightforward, but if you run into any issues, you can always call us back.

Customer: Okay. Um, and there's no charge for this, right? Since it's the modem that broke?

Agent: That's a good question. Modem replacement is typically covered under your service agreement, so it shouldn't cost you anything. You'll just need to bring it back to the location or... we can ship you a return label. The associate at the store can give you all those details.

Customer: Okay, alright. Well, I guess I'll head over there. Thank you.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. I'm sorry you had to deal with this today. Is there anything else I can help you with before I let you go?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Great. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
