# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up and running. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get a name, please?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. Thanks for that. So you're saying your internet is completely down as of this morning?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. I tried unplugging the modem and router earlier, like I usually do, but it didn't help. The modem's got lights on it, but... I don't know, nothing's really working.

Agent: Okay, that's a good first step that you already tried. Let me pull up your account here real quick. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm seeing your account. And just to confirm, you have our Fiber 200 service, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. Whatever the standard package is.

Agent: Great. So first, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your modem right now? Are they green, red, blinking?

Customer: Um, so there's like... the power light is green. And then there's one that says, uh... "online" maybe? That one's red. And there's another one that's blinking orange.

Agent: Okay, so the online light being red is telling me that your modem isn't connecting to our network. That's what we need to fix. Can you check the back of the modem for me? There should be a cable coming from the wall into the modem. Can you see that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. The cord's plugged in.

Agent: Good. And is it plugged in firmly? Sometimes they can loosen up a bit.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Let me... yeah, it looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Alright. And on the other end, where it connects to the wall, can you check that connection too?

Customer: (pause) Oh, huh. Actually, it's a little... it's not quite all the way in. Let me push that in. (sound of clicking)

Agent: Perfect. Do you see any change in the lights?

Customer: (pause) Umm... not yet. Still red.

Agent: Okay, give it just a moment. Sometimes it takes about thirty seconds to establish the connection. Just keep an eye on that online light for me.

Customer: (long pause) ...Still red. It's still red.

Agent: Alright. Is it still blinking orange on the other light, or has that changed?

Customer: Yeah, it's still blinking orange.

Agent: Okay. Let's try a full restart of the modem. Can you unplug the power cable from the back of the modem?

Customer: Yeah, doing it now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Let's leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. While we wait, let me ask you—have there been any recent storms in your area or any work done on the lines nearby? Anything like that?

Customer: Um, no, nothing that I know of. It just stopped working this morning. I woke up and tried to check my email and... nothing.

Agent: Understood. Okay, go ahead and plug that power cable back in for me now.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, plugged back in. The lights are... coming back on now.

Agent: Perfect. And just like before, let's give it a moment to boot back up and try to establish connection. This usually takes about a minute.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, I'm... I'm watching it. The power light came back on green. The other light is still red though. Still blinking orange.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Is your router also powered on? The separate device?

Customer: Oh, yeah. Yeah, the router's on. It's the box next to the modem.

Agent: Good. And that one has lights too?

Customer: Yeah, it's got some lights. Looks pretty normal, I guess. Green and blue lights on that one.

Agent: Alright. So the router seems to be fine, but the modem isn't connecting. James, I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I check some things on the backend here. It'll just be a moment.

Customer: Okay, no problem.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Okay, James, I'm back. So I'm looking at the signal on your line and I'm actually seeing a pretty significant signal degradation on your fiber connection. That could definitely be causing this issue.

Customer: Is that... is that something I can fix?

Agent: It might be something on our end, actually. This could be a line issue somewhere between the network and your house. But let me try one more thing with you first. Can you look at the modem again and see if there's a small reset button? It might be recessed in a little hole.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's like a tiny little button.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to have you hold that button for ten seconds. You might need to use a paperclip or a pen to reach it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, getting a pen... (pause) I'm pressing it.

Agent: And keep it pressed for the full ten seconds...

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, ten seconds is up. (pause) The lights are all going off now.

Agent: Right, that's the reset. It should reboot completely now. This is a full factory reset, so it'll take about two to three minutes to come back online.

Customer: (pause) Okay. How long do you want me to wait?

Agent: Let's give it a solid three minutes. I'll wait on the line with you.

Customer: Alright.

(long pause with background noise)

Agent: Still waiting for those lights to come back?

Customer: Yeah, still waiting. The power light just came back on actually.

Agent: Okay, good. And the others?

Customer: (pause) ...The online light is still... it's still red. Same thing.

Agent: (pause) Still red?

Customer: Yeah. Same as before.

Agent: Okay. James, so the signal degradation I'm seeing is pretty significant, and given that we've tried the basic troubleshooting steps and the reset hasn't helped, I think we're looking at a physical line issue here. That's not something we can fix over the phone.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long will it take to fix?

Agent: What I'd like to do is escalate this to our field service team. They can send a technician out to your location to check the fiber line and see if there's a break or damage somewhere. Let me get you scheduled for that.

Customer: Okay... when could they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) So let me see what our availability looks like. When are you typically home?

Customer: I work from home, so I'm here most of the time. Anytime this week works.

Agent: Great. We actually have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning, yeah, that's fine. I can do that.

Agent: Perfect. I've got you scheduled for a technician visit tomorrow between 8 and noon. You should get a confirmation text and email shortly. The technician will assess the line and let you know what's going on. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I mean, I wish we could have fixed it right now, but... I guess tomorrow is okay. Thanks for trying.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't resolve it over the phone. I know that's frustrating. But our field service team is really good, and they should be able to get you back up and running quickly. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.
