# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I work from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's... (pause) it's the number you just called me from, actually. The area code is 602.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. So your internet has been down since this morning. Have you tried unplugging your modem and router yet?

Customer: Yeah, I did that like an hour ago. I waited like thirty seconds and plugged it back in, but nothing changed. Still no connection.

Agent: Alright, that's a good first step that you already did. Can you tell me—when you say there's no connection, are you not seeing any lights on the modem, or are the lights on but you're just not getting online?

Customer: The lights are on. I see the power light and... um... (pause) there's a couple other lights, but they're not doing anything. I think one of them is supposed to be blinking or something?

Agent: Right, yeah. So ideally you should see a light that indicates internet connection—that's usually green and it should be solid or blinking. The fact that it's not lit up suggests the modem isn't connecting to the network. Let me ask you this—do you see a cable going from the wall into the back of your modem?

Customer: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at it now. There's a coaxial cable, I think you call it? It's plugged in.

Agent: Perfect. And is that cable, uh, is it plugged in firmly, or does it seem a little loose?

Customer: (pause) Hmm, let me... (sounds of movement) ...no, it feels pretty tight to me.

Agent: Okay, good. Can you try unplugging it anyway and then plugging it back in really firmly? Sometimes these can wiggle loose.

Customer: (sound of disconnection) Alright, I'm unplugging it now... (pause) ...okay, plugging it back in... (pause) Nope, still nothing. The lights are still the same.

Agent: Alright. And you have the modem plugged directly into the wall outlet, correct? Not through a power strip?

Customer: No, it's directly in the wall.

Agent: Good. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, so it's not a widespread issue. Can you tell me—is your modem a Frontier-issued modem, or is it one you provided yourself?

Customer: It's the one you guys gave me when we signed up. It's been working fine for like two years, so...

Agent: Okay, understood. Let me have you do a full restart on the modem. I want you to unplug the power cable this time, and wait for about two minutes before plugging it back in. That'll do a complete reset. Can you do that now?

Customer: (sighing) Yeah, okay. (sound of disconnection, pause) Two minutes, right? I'm starting the timer on my phone.

Agent: (pause) (background hold music faintly audible)

Customer: Alright, it's been two minutes. Plugging it back in now. (sound of connection) And... (long pause) ...nope. Same thing. The lights are still not showing anything.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Let me check a couple other things here. Can you look at the back of the modem and tell me if you see a button that says "Reset" on it?

Customer: Um... (pause, sounds of movement) Yeah, there's a button here that says "Reset" but there's also a warning on the modem that says resetting will erase your settings.

Agent: Right, so we're not going to press that just yet. That's usually a last resort. Let me see... (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to need to dig a little deeper on my end. This might take a moment. Are you still able to stay on the line with me?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here. Like I said, I just really need to get this working because I have calls coming up this afternoon.

Agent: I completely understand, and we're going to do our best to get you back online. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like we should be provisioning signal to your modem, but... (pause) ...I'm not seeing an active connection from your unit. That's unusual. Can you tell me—have you experienced any bad weather recently, or any storms in your area?

Customer: No, not that I can think of. It's been pretty clear here all week.

Agent: Alright. And you haven't had any recent power outages or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that either.

Agent: Okay. (pause, typing sounds) I think at this point, we might be looking at a hardware issue with the modem itself. It's possible the modem has failed. But before we go down that road, let me try one more thing. Do you have access to a different power outlet you could try? Just to rule out an issue with the outlet itself?

Customer: Oh, that's a good idea. (sounds of movement) Let me try... (pause) ...okay, I'm moving it over to the outlet by my desk. Unplugging it... (pause) ...and plugging it in here. (pause) Nope. Still the same.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so it's not the outlet. Alright, uh... (pause) ...let me be honest with you. Based on what we're seeing here, I believe the modem might have reached the end of its life. These devices typically last about five to seven years, and you mentioned you've had yours for two years, but sometimes they just fail unexpectedly.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you send me a new one?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. We can ship you a replacement modem at no charge. However, I do want to mention that there's one more thing I could try, and that's having a technician come out to your location to check the line coming into your house. There's a possibility—it's a small one, but it's possible—that the issue isn't the modem but the line itself.

Customer: How long would that take? Can they come today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... (pause) I'm seeing that our earliest availability is actually tomorrow morning between 8 and 12. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sigh) I guess it'll have to. I can't work without internet anyway.

Agent: I understand. So we have two options: I can schedule the technician visit for tomorrow, or I can send out a replacement modem to you right now via expedited shipping, and it should arrive tomorrow as well. If it's a hardware issue, you could potentially be up and running by tomorrow afternoon.

Customer: Can't you just... I don't know... send both? That way we cover all the bases?

Agent: (pause) That's actually not a bad idea. Yes, I can do that. I'll schedule the technician visit and we'll send out the replacement modem. The modem will likely arrive before the technician, so you can try that first.

Customer: Okay, yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) So just to recap what we're doing here: We're sending a replacement modem via overnight shipping to your address on file, and I'm scheduling a technician visit for tomorrow morning. If the modem fixes the issue, great—you'll be back online. If not, the technician can investigate further when they arrive.

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Can you give me a reference number or something?

Agent: Of course. Your service request number is FR-9847521. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with that number, and the modem tracking information should be available within the next couple hours. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that's it. I just... I really hope one of these fixes it.

Agent: I completely understand your concern, and I'm confident we're going to get you back online soon. I apologize again for the frustration this has caused. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's everything.

Agent: Alright, thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. We really appreciate your business, and we'll get this resolved for you.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye.
