Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back on. I've tried unplugging the modem and router but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And what's the best name I can have for you today?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) Okay, I've got you. So you're in the Denver area, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned you've already tried unplugging your modem and router. When you plugged them back in, did you wait for all the lights to come back on before trying to connect?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I waited like five minutes. The modem lights are on, but the internet still isn't working. Like, I can't load any websites or anything.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. And are you getting any error messages on your devices, or does it just seem like there's no connection at all?

Customer: No error messages. It's just like... the WiFi shows up on my phone, but when I try to connect, it won't actually load anything. My laptop's the same way.

Agent: Got it. So the WiFi is broadcasting, but you're not actually getting internet access. James, let me ask you—are you able to plug a device directly into the modem with an ethernet cable? Sometimes that helps us figure out if it's a WiFi issue or a broader connection problem.

Customer: I... yeah, I think I have a cable somewhere. Hold on. (pause, background noise of drawers opening) Okay, found one. (pause) Alright, plugging in now. (pause) Yeah, it's plugged in. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, so it's not a WiFi issue then. Let me check something on the modem itself. Can you tell me what color the lights are on the front of it right now?

Customer: Um, there's a green light at the top, and then below that there's... it looks like a red light, maybe? It's definitely not green.

Agent: A red light. Okay. That red light—is it next to anything that says "Internet" or "WAN" or anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, actually, I think it says... yeah, "Internet" or something. Why is it red?

Agent: The red Internet light typically indicates that the modem isn't detecting a signal from our network. This could mean a few things. Let me check our systems here to see if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds, pause) One moment, James...

Customer: Okay, no problem.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm not seeing any major outages reported in your zip code right now. But let's try a few more things. Can you unplug the modem again, wait about 30 seconds, and plug it back in? Sometimes it just needs to completely reset.

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, okay. Unplugging now. (pause) Thirty seconds... (pause) Okay, plugging back in.

Agent: Alright, just give it a minute or so to boot back up. While we wait, is your modem a newer one or has it been a while?

Customer: I mean, I think I got it a couple years ago? Maybe three years? It's the one you guys provided.

Agent: Okay, that should still be fine. (pause) How's it looking now? Is the Internet light still red?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... yeah, still red. And my phone is still showing no connection.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Let me check something. Are you able to see the back of the modem? I want to make sure all the cables are properly connected.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, yeah, I'm looking at it. There's the power cable, and then there's another one coming in from the wall...

Agent: Perfect. That second one is the line coming from our network. Make sure it's snug. Just give it a gentle tug to verify.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it feels pretty secure. It doesn't move or anything.

Agent: Alright. You know what, James, I'm going to be honest with you—the red Internet light combined with the system check I'm running suggests there might be an issue on our end with your line coming into the house. This could be a fiber line issue or something in the network equipment outside.

Customer: Oh, so... what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, typically this would require a technician to come out and check the line from the street to your house. But before we schedule that, let me try one more thing. I'm going to send a refresh signal to your modem remotely. It'll take about 30 seconds. Just keep an eye on those lights.

Customer: Okay, yeah, do whatever you can.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, sending it now. (pause) It should be processing... (pause) Okay, James, what are you seeing on the modem?

Customer: (pause) Um... the lights are... they're kind of flickering now. Does that mean it's working?

Agent: That's actually a good sign. Those should settle in just a moment. (pause, longer pause) How about now?

Customer: (pause) Okay, the green one is solid again, but the Internet light is still red. (frustrated sigh)

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately... it's still red. Okay, I'm going to be straight with you—I've done what I can from my end, and the system isn't showing a connection coming through to your modem. That really does point to something outside your house on our network infrastructure.

Customer: So what happens now? How long before someone can come out?

Agent: Let me get you scheduled for a technician visit. We do have availability, typically within the next 2 to 3 business days depending on your area. Is there a day that works better for you than another?

Customer: Really? 2 to 3 days? I need my internet for work. Can't someone come out sooner?

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds, pause) Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day appointments available in your area. The earliest I can get someone out there is actually tomorrow between 1 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Yeah, okay, I guess that'll have to work. That's better than waiting three days.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, we're looking at (pause) tomorrow from 1 to 4 PM. A technician will come to your residence to check the line and identify what's causing the connection issue. Is there a phone number where they can reach you if there are any issues?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147, same as my account.

Agent: Perfect. And James, I do want to apologize for the inconvenience. I know you need this working for your work. Unfortunately, with the modem not receiving a signal from our network, this is beyond what I can troubleshoot remotely.

Customer: Yeah, I get it. It's frustrating, but I appreciate you trying.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help clarify before your appointment tomorrow?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully they can fix it quickly.

Agent: I'm sure they will. Thank you for your patience, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. Bye.

Agent: Bye, James. Have a good day.
