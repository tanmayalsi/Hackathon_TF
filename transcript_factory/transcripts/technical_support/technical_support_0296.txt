# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Marcus. Um, my internet just completely went out about an hour ago and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account here under the name... Robert Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, thanks Robert. So your internet service went down about an hour ago, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, like right around one o'clock. I was working from home and everything was fine, and then suddenly nothing. No internet, no WiFi, nothing.

Agent: Alright, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what you're seeing? Is your modem powered on? Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, the modem's on. I see... let me look... I see a couple lights. There's a green light and then... I think there's a red light?

Agent: Okay, can you describe which lights are on and where they're located? Like, is the red light next to a WiFi symbol or an internet symbol or something?

Customer: It's... honestly, I'm not great with this stuff. There's lights on the front. One's green, one's red. The red one... it might be blinking? It's hard to tell.

Agent: No problem at all. The red blinking light is usually an indicator that there's an issue with the connection. Let's do a restart. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Yeah, it's off.

Agent: Great. And while that's unplugging, let me also ask – do you have a router as well, or is it all-in-one?

Customer: I think it's just the modem. That's the thing Frontier gave me when they installed it.

Agent: Perfect. So go ahead and leave that unplugged for about thirty seconds. Just give it a little breather.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) ...still counting?

Agent: You can go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's booting up. The lights are coming back on. (pause) So now I've got the green light and... the red light's still there but I don't think it's blinking as much? Or maybe it is, I can't really tell.

Agent: Okay, that's good. Give it just a minute to fully boot up. Those lights should stabilize. In the meantime, can you try opening up a web browser on your computer or phone and see if you can load a website?

Customer: Yeah, let me try. (pause) I'm trying to go to Google... (pause) Nope. Nothing. It's just... it's not loading.

Agent: Alright, and are you connecting to the WiFi from the modem, or do you have an ethernet cable plugged in?

Customer: WiFi. I'm on my laptop.

Agent: Okay, so let's try connecting via ethernet just to rule out a WiFi issue. Do you have an ethernet cable?

Customer: Um... (pause) I might have one somewhere. Let me look... (pause) This is gonna take me a second. I've got a bunch of stuff in my desk drawer.

Agent: No problem at all, take your time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I think I found one. It's been a while since I've used one of these.

Agent: [inaudible] just plug one end into the back of the modem and the other end into your laptop.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, so I'm plugging it in... (pause) Okay, it's connected. Let me try the browser again. (pause) Nope. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful information. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm. So I'm looking at your modem status here and I'm seeing that it's showing as offline on our end. That's interesting because the modem appears to be powered on for you.

Customer: What does that mean? Like, the modem's not working?

Agent: It could be a few things. It might mean the modem itself is having an issue, or it could be a problem with the line coming into your home. Let me check if there have been any outages in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages in your neighborhood, which is good news and bad news – good that it's not a widespread thing, but it means we need to dig a little deeper.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: Well, let's try a couple more things. Can you take a look at the modem and tell me if there's a cable coming out of the back of it that's connected to a wall outlet?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, there is. It's like a coax cable, I think? Like the cable TV kind?

Agent: That's exactly it. Can you check that the cable is securely connected? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking at it now... I'm gonna wiggle it a little bit. (pause) I don't know, it seems pretty secure to me. It's not moving much. But I can try unscrewing it and reconnecting it if that helps?

Agent: Yeah, that's actually a great idea. Go ahead and do that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm unscrewing it... (pause) Got it. (pause) Now I'm screwing it back in. (pause) Okay, it's snug now.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give it another minute to see if that helps it reconnect. In the meantime, are you still seeing that red light on the modem?

Customer: Yeah, it's still there. (pause) Do you think the modem might just be broken? Because I've had it for like... I don't know, five or six years maybe?

Agent: That's very possible. Modems do have a lifespan, and five or six years is actually getting up there. But let's not jump to conclusions yet. Let me check your line. Have you experienced any issues recently? Any outages or slow speeds before today?

Customer: Not really, no. It's been pretty steady. This just came out of nowhere.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Robert, I'm going to be honest with you – from what I'm seeing on my end and what we've tried so far, it does seem like either there's an issue with your modem or potentially a problem with the line itself. But I'm not able to definitively diagnose it over the phone.

Customer: So what does that mean? What happens now?

Agent: Well, we have a couple of options. One is that we can send a technician out to your home to physically check your equipment and the line. That's probably going to be the most reliable way to figure out exactly what's going on. Or, we can try sending a replacement modem to you – that's sometimes faster if you're comfortable doing a self-installation.

Customer: How long would a technician take? And how much would that cost?

Agent: For a technician visit, we'd be looking at probably within the next two business days. And since we haven't been able to resolve this on the phone, a service call would be covered under your service plan – there shouldn't be a charge for the visit itself.

Customer: Okay, and if we do the replacement modem?

Agent: If we send a replacement modem, you'd get it in about three to five business days, depending on your location. Then you'd set it up yourself, which is pretty straightforward. But that would likely take a bit longer than getting a technician out here.

Customer: I mean... I really need my internet back as soon as possible. I work from home. How soon could a technician get here?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm seeing we have some availability tomorrow afternoon or the following morning. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be ideal if that's possible.

Agent: Great. Let me get some information for the appointment. Are you available between one and five PM tomorrow?

Customer: Yeah, that should work.

Agent: Perfect. And just to cover all our bases before we lock in the appointment – can we try one more thing? Let me have you do a factory reset on the modem. That's a little different from just unplugging it.

Customer: Okay, what do I do?

Agent: There should be a small button, usually recessed, somewhere on the back or bottom of the modem. You might need a paperclip or a pen to press it. While the modem is powered on, press and hold that button for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking... I see a little button here. Is it like super small?

Agent: Yeah, it should be pretty small.

Customer: Okay, I found it. I'm gonna use a pen. (pause) Pressing it... (pause) ...holding it... (pause) Okay, I held it for about ten seconds. Now what?

Agent: Just let the modem reboot completely. It might take a minute or two. You'll see the lights reset and come back on.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Yeah, it's rebooting. (pause) Lights are coming back on. The green light's back. And... (pause) the red light's still there.

Agent: Still the red light?

Customer: Yeah. Still blinking red.

Agent: (pause) Alright, Robert, I think at this point we've done everything we can troubleshoot remotely. That red light is persistent, and the modem isn't registering on our network, which tells me there's something that needs hands-on attention. I'm going to go ahead and schedule that technician appointment for you tomorrow afternoon. Let me get your address to confirm.

Customer: It's 447 Maple Street, apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 447 Maple Street, apartment 3B. And is that in Portland?

Customer: Yes, Portland.

Agent: Perfect. So we have you scheduled for tomorrow, [inaudible], between one and five PM. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. You should receive a confirmation email shortly, and you can also call back to check on the status of the appointment if you need to.

Customer: Okay, so tomorrow. Got it. Is there anything I should do in the meantime?

Agent: Just leave the modem plugged in and powered on so the technician can see what's happening when they arrive. And if by some chance it comes back online on its own – and sometimes these things do surprise us – just give us a call and let us know so we can cancel the appointment.

Customer: Will do. Thanks for your help, Marcus.

Agent: Of course, Robert. I'm sorry we weren't able to get you back online today, but the technician will definitely take care of you tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and sorry again for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
