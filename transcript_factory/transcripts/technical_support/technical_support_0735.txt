Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got work calls coming up and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you taken care of. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account here for... is this James Mitchell?

Customer: That's me, yeah.

Agent: Great, James. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage right now?

Customer: Yeah, complete. No connection at all. The router's still on—I can see the lights—but nothing's connecting to it.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me just ask you a few quick questions. Do you have a modem in addition to the router, or just the router?

Customer: Um, I think I have both? There's like... there's a white box that's connected to the wall jack, and then there's the router sitting next to it.

Agent: Perfect, that's exactly what we want to hear. So the modem—that white box—do you see any lights on it right now?

Customer: Let me look... yeah, I see some lights. There's a couple that are on. One's red though, I think.

Agent: Okay, which light is red? Is it the one on the left, right, or...?

Customer: (pause) It's like... in the middle area. Hard to say exactly.

Agent: No problem. Here's what we're gonna do. Let's do a quick restart of your equipment. Can you unplug the modem—that white box—from the power outlet?

Customer: (pause) Unplugging now... done.

Agent: Great. Just leave that unplugged for about 30 seconds while I'm here with you. (pause) So James, how long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, probably about two years now? I've had pretty good service until today.

Agent: We appreciate that. Okay, it's been about 30 seconds. Go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in... okay, lights are coming back up.

Agent: Excellent. While that's booting back up, let me ask—did you have any storms in your area recently? Power fluctuations, anything like that?

Customer: There was some weather yesterday, but nothing major today that I saw.

Agent: Okay, good to know. Give it about another 20 seconds or so to fully boot up. (pause) Alright, is the modem showing any different lights now?

Customer: Um... I'm still seeing that red light in the middle.

Agent: Still red? Okay. Let me try something else here. Can you tell me what the lights look like? Do they say anything next to them?

Customer: Let me see... it says "Power," "Online," and I think "Signal" maybe?

Agent: Perfect. So that red light you're seeing—is that the "Online" light?

Customer: I think so, yeah. It's definitely not the power one since that one's green.

Agent: Okay, that makes sense. If the Online light is red, that usually means the modem isn't connecting to our network. Let's try power cycling the router as well now. Can you unplug your router?

Customer: Sure. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds, same as before.

Customer: (pause) Thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Go ahead and plug that back in.

Customer: Doing it now. (pause) Okay, it's back on.

Agent: Great. Give that a minute to fully boot. While we're waiting, I'm gonna check a few things on our end here. (typing sounds) (pause) Are you able to connect to any wireless networks on your phone or any devices?

Customer: No, nothing. I tried my phone and my laptop. Both show no available networks.

Agent: Okay, that confirms the router isn't broadcasting. That's actually pointing more toward the modem connection issue. Let me check something—is the cable that connects to the modem secure? The one going into the wall or wherever it's coming from?

Customer: (pause) Hold on, let me look behind here... yeah, it looks pretty snug to me.

Agent: Try unplugging it and plugging it back in. Sometimes these connections get a little loose.

Customer: (sounds of rustling) Okay, unplugged and... back in. (pause) Hmm, the Online light's still red.

Agent: Still red, huh? (pause) Alright, let me check on our network here for your address. Can I confirm your service address with you?

Customer: 447 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing) Okay, I'm looking at 447 Maple... (pause) ...3B. Hmm. (pause) James, I'm not seeing any active alerts or outages in your area. The network appears to be up and running on our end.

Customer: So it's something with my equipment then?

Agent: Well, it could be. Let me try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? There should be a small button, maybe recessed, on the back or bottom.

Customer: Oh man, a factory reset? I don't know if I want to do that. Does that mess everything up?

Agent: It'll reset the modem back to default settings, so we'd need to get you set back up with your network, but it's worth trying. Sometimes a reset can resolve connection issues like this.

Customer: (pause) Yeah... okay. I'm looking for the button now. (pause) There's a small hole back here. Is that it?

Agent: Probably. You might need a paperclip or something thin to press it. Hold it down for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (sounds of rustling) Okay, I've got a paperclip. (pause) Pressing it now... (pause) Okay, lights are going crazy. (pause) Alright, it's done.

Agent: Perfect. Let's wait about a minute for it to fully reboot. (pause) You should see the lights stabilize here in a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay... the lights have calmed down. But... the Online light is still red, unfortunately.

Agent: (pause) Still red? Okay, that's... that's not great. (typing sounds) (pause) James, I'm gonna be honest with you—if the modem isn't connecting after the restart and the reset, this is likely something on the hardware level or potentially a line issue we'd need to investigate further.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, do I need a new modem?

Agent: It could be the modem, or it could be an issue with the line coming into your building. I don't want to guess here. What I'd recommend is we get a technician out to your place to do a full diagnostic. They can check the line, the modem, all of that.

Customer: How long does that usually take to set up?

Agent: (typing) We have availability tomorrow afternoon, or we could potentially get someone out there the day after. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be great, actually. What time?

Agent: Let me see what we have... we could do 2 to 4 PM or 4 to 6 PM. Which is better for you?

Customer: The 2 to 4 window works better.

Agent: Excellent. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing) You're all set for tomorrow, 2 to 4 PM, at 447 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B. A technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive. Is the number we have on file the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Great. James, I really apologize we couldn't resolve this over the phone today. But our technician should be able to get to the root of the issue tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate you trying. Do I need to do anything else before they get there?

Agent: Just make sure the modem and router stay plugged in, and maybe have them easily accessible. That's about it. We'll take it from there.

Customer: Sounds good. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
