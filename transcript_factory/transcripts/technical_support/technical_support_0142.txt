Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I'm showing an account for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So your internet service went down this morning around what time would you say?

Customer: Yeah, maybe around 9 AM? I was trying to work from home and just... nothing. Won't connect.

Agent: Okay, and have you tried unplugging your modem and router yet? Sometimes that can solve the issue pretty quickly.

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead. Just unplug the modem—that's the device that usually has the Frontier logo on it—and the router, and then wait about thirty seconds before plugging them back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Alright, they're both unplugged. How long did you say?

Agent: About thirty seconds, yeah.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging them back in. (background noise of devices powering up) The lights are coming back on... the modem's got the blue light now...

Agent: Perfect. And does your router have any lights on it?

Customer: Uh, yeah, the power light is on, and... let me see... there's a blinking light. I think it's the internet light?

Agent: Good, that's normal. It can take a minute or two for everything to sync back up. Do you have a device nearby you can try connecting to?

Customer: I've got my phone here. Let me see if I can... (pause) Hmm, still not showing up. Like, my WiFi network isn't even appearing.

Agent: Okay, give it just another minute. Sometimes it takes a little longer to broadcast the network. While we wait, let me ask—did anything change with your setup recently? Any storms, power outages, anything like that?

Customer: Well, yeah, actually. We had that bad storm last night. Really heavy rain, lot of wind. But I don't see how that would... I mean, everything's indoors.

Agent: Right, but sometimes power surges from storms can affect equipment. Is your modem plugged into a surge protector?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't think so. It's just plugged into a regular outlet.

Agent: Ah, okay. Well, that could potentially be it. But let's... let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) I'm going to check if we're showing any issues on the line to your address. (pause) Hold on just one second...

Customer: Yeah, no problem.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any outages in your area, and your modem is registering on our network, which is... that's actually a good sign.

Customer: Wait, so it's registering? But I still can't get online.

Agent: Right, so the modem is communicating with us, but it sounds like maybe your router isn't connecting properly. Um, is there a reset button on your router? It might be small and recessed.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see one. It's really tiny.

Agent: Okay, so what I want you to do is use a paperclip or something thin and hold that button down for about ten seconds. That'll do a factory reset.

Customer: (pause) Doing it now... okay, I held it for like fifteen seconds to be safe. The lights went off and now they're coming back on. (pause) Okay, so now I'm checking for the network again... (longer pause) I'm not seeing it still.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, let me try something else here. Can you check the back of your modem? There should be some lights on it. What do you see?

Customer: Um, there's one that says "Internet" and it's... it's solid green.

Agent: Okay, that's good. And there's one that says "WiFi" or has a WiFi symbol?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's... orange? Is that bad?

Agent: Orange usually means the WiFi is having trouble connecting. That could mean the router and modem aren't talking to each other properly. (pause) Have you tried... this might sound silly, but have you tried restarting your computer or phone? Just to make sure it's not a device issue?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me restart my phone real quick. (pause) Okay, booting back up... (pause) Nope. Still not seeing the network at all.

Agent: Alright, um... (pause) I'm wondering if maybe the power surge from the storm affected your router. That does happen, unfortunately. Let me ask you this—do you remember roughly how old your router is?

Customer: I mean, you guys gave it to us... I want to say three years ago? Four maybe?

Agent: Okay, so it's possible that after the surge, it may have been damaged. The modem seems to be okay, but the router might be the issue. (typing sounds) Looking at your account, I'm showing you should be eligible for a replacement router. I can definitely get one out to you, but it will take... looks like five to seven business days.

Customer: Five to seven days? I need internet before that. I work from home. This is... can't you just send it faster?

Agent: I understand, and I really wish I could. Unfortunately, that's the fastest shipping we have available right now. Though if you wanted to try purchasing one on your own in the meantime from an electronics store, any router should be compatible with our modem.

Customer: (frustrated) I mean... I guess. But I shouldn't have to pay for that if the equipment you provided got damaged.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me see what I can do here. (pause) Let me try one more troubleshooting step before we go down the replacement route. Can you try plugging the ethernet cable directly from the modem to your computer? Just to see if you can get a wired connection?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Give me a second. (pause) I'm going to have to move my desk a bit. (pause) Okay, I've got the cable plugged in now. (pause) Oh! Oh wow, I'm connected!

Agent: You are? That's great!

Customer: Yeah, the internet's working through the ethernet cable. So the problem is definitely the router then?

Agent: It looks that way, yeah. The modem is fine, but something's preventing the WiFi router from functioning properly. So the good news is it's not your internet service itself. The bad news is we need to get you a new router.

Customer: (sigh) Okay. And there's really no way to speed up that shipping?

Agent: Let me check one more time... (typing sounds) (pause) Unfortunately, no. Five to seven business days is the standard. But I can absolutely get that order placed for you right now, and I won't charge you for it. I'll also add a courtesy credit to your account for the inconvenience of being without WiFi during that time.

Customer: How much of a credit are we talking?

Agent: I can do $25 for this month.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I guess that's something. Yeah, go ahead and order the router.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got an order confirmation number here. That's going to be... 847-556. You should receive tracking information within 24 hours to the email on your account. Can I just confirm that email is still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And in the meantime, you can use that ethernet connection if you need to work from home. I know it's not ideal, but at least you'll have internet access.

Customer: Yeah, I mean, it's not perfect, but it beats nothing. I'll just have to move my laptop around.

Agent: I really do apologize for the inconvenience, Robert. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help, even though we couldn't get the WiFi working.

Agent: Of course. And again, sorry we couldn't troubleshoot it further. Your router should arrive within that week, and if you have any issues when you install it, please don't hesitate to call us back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, Robert. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
