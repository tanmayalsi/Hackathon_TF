Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without connection all day. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And your name?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, David. I see your account here. You have our Fiber 200 plan. So your internet just went out this morning, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, around 8 AM. One minute it was working fine, the next... nothing. No lights on the modem, nothing.

Agent: Alright. First thing I want to try is the simplest fix. Can you locate your modem for me? It's the white box, probably near your router.

Customer: (background noise of footsteps) Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. Like I said, there's no lights on it at all.

Agent: Okay, so no lights. That typically means there's no power getting to it. Can you check the power cable for me? Make sure it's plugged in securely on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Um... yeah, it's plugged into the wall. Let me check the other end... (rustling) It looks like it's connected to the modem, but... wait, actually, let me trace this. The cable's a little loose here.

Agent: Try tightening that connection for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I've got it tightened down. Still... nothing. No lights.

Agent: Hmm. Can you try unplugging the power cable from the wall for me? Just wait about 30 seconds, then plug it back in.

Customer: Yeah, give me a second. (pause) Unplugged. (long pause) Okay, plugging it back in now... (pause) Alright, come on... (pause) Still nothing, Marcus. Still completely dark.

Agent: Okay, that's... that's unusual. While we're waiting, sometimes it takes a moment to boot back up. Let's give it another 10 seconds or so. Is there any light activity at all? Even faint?

Customer: No, nothing. I'm staring right at it. Dead.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright. Let me ask you a few questions. Have you experienced any storms recently? Any power outages in your area?

Customer: No, everything else in my house is fine. The lights are on, my TV works. It's just... it's just the modem.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. Um, do you have a backup battery or a different power outlet you could try? Sometimes the outlet itself can go bad.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I can try a different outlet. (pause) Let me unplug it again and move it over here... (rustling sounds) Okay, I've got it plugged into the outlet by my computer now.

Agent: Great. Let's see if that does anything.

Customer: (long pause) No. Still nothing. This is... I mean, is the modem just broken?

Agent: It's possible, but let me try one more thing before we go down that road. Can you tell me—when you say there's no lights, are you absolutely certain? Sometimes the indicator lights can be pretty dim.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking at it with my phone flashlight. Trust me, there's nothing. Completely black.

Agent: Okay. (pause) And you're sure the power cable itself is undamaged? No... no fraying or anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Looks fine to me. The cable looks totally normal.

Agent: Alright. (typing sounds) I'm going to check something on my end. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, then returns) Okay, I'm back. I don't see any service outages in your area, and your account shows everything active on our end. So the issue is definitely with the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it dead?

Agent: Well, it's likely a power issue with the modem. The fact that it won't respond to anything we're trying suggests the power supply inside might have failed. Or... (pause) have you had the modem for a long time?

Customer: I don't know, maybe three years? Four years?

Agent: That could be it. These modems typically last about five to seven years, so it could just be reaching end of life. The power supply in these units can degrade over time.

Customer: Okay, so what do I do? I need internet for work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. So here's what we can do. We can send you a replacement modem at no charge. Typically that takes about five to seven business days.

Customer: Five to seven days? I can't wait that long. I work from home. I need internet tomorrow.

Agent: (pause) I... I understand that's frustrating. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) Unfortunately, we don't have expedited shipping available for warranty replacements, but you could potentially pick one up at a Frontier retail location if you have one nearby?

Customer: (frustrated) There's one like 20 minutes away, but they're going to have one in stock?

Agent: That I can't guarantee, but it would be worth calling them. Do you want me to give you that number?

Customer: Yeah, give it to me.

Agent: (typing sounds) That would be 555-0289. But David, before you go, I do want to make absolutely sure. You're certain the modem isn't powering on? Because I'd hate for you to make a trip if there's something we're missing.

Customer: (pause) I mean... it's not powering on. There's nothing. I've tried everything you said.

Agent: Right, I hear you. Unfortunately, I think we've exhausted the troubleshooting options on my end. At this point, I'm fairly confident we're looking at a hardware failure.

Customer: (sigh) Alright. Well, I guess I'll head out to that store and see what they can do. What's going to happen with my service? Am I still being charged?

Agent: That's a good question. Let me make a note on your account that you're without service due to equipment failure. We can apply a service credit for today. And once you get the new modem set up, you should be back online immediately.

Customer: Okay. So one more time, the number is 555-0289?

Agent: That's correct. And just to confirm, you'll need to bring a form of ID with you, and we can get you set up with a replacement modem right away.

Customer: Alright, thanks. I guess I'll call you back if they don't have one.

Agent: Sounds good. Again, I apologize we couldn't get this sorted over the phone. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks for trying.

Agent: You're welcome, David. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we hope to get you back online soon.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye.
