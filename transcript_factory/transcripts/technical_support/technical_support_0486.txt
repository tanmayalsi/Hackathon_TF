Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, so my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I've got some work stuff I need to handle.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. Michael, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you're saying your internet went down this morning. Have you tried power cycling your modem and router yet?

Customer: Um... I think so? I unplugged the thing—the white box—for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in. That's... that's what you're supposed to do, right?

Agent: Yes, exactly. That's the modem. Did you also unplug the router? That's usually a separate device. Sometimes it's black or has little antennas on it.

Customer: Oh. No, I didn't. I just... I didn't realize those were different things. Let me do that now.

Agent: Yeah, go ahead. Just unplug it for about thirty seconds and plug it back in.

Customer: (background noise of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged. I'm waiting... thirty seconds. (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, the lights are coming back on.

Agent: Good. Go ahead and give it about two minutes to fully boot up. In the meantime, can you tell me... do you see any lights on the modem right now?

Customer: Um, yeah. There's a green light on the front. And some other lights.

Agent: Perfect. You should see a green light that indicates internet connection. Is that solid green or is it blinking?

Customer: It's... it's blinking. Is that bad?

Agent: Blinking usually means it's trying to connect or sync. Let's give it just a little more time. (pause) So while we wait, have there been any storms in your area recently? Sometimes that can cause issues with the line.

Customer: Oh, actually, yeah. There was like a pretty bad storm last night. Really heavy rain. Could that be it?

Agent: That could definitely be a factor. Hopefully just a temporary thing. (pause) Okay, check on that internet light again for me. What's it doing now?

Customer: Still blinking. It's been like... (pause) ...maybe a minute and a half, two minutes now since I plugged it back in.

Agent: Let's give it just a bit more time. Sometimes after a storm, the line can take a little longer to stabilize. (pause) Why don't you try opening a web browser on one of your devices and see if you can reach a website? Just try something simple like Google.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm opening... (typing sounds) Nope. It's just showing "no internet connection."

Agent: Alright. And that light's still blinking?

Customer: Yeah, still blinking.

Agent: Okay. Let me try a couple of other things here. Can you look at the modem and tell me if there are any red lights on it?

Customer: (pause) No... no red lights. Just the green one blinking and then some other ones.

Agent: Any amber or orange lights?

Customer: Um, there's like a yellow one. Is that orange? I'm not sure.

Agent: Yellow could be a connection issue. Where exactly is that light?

Customer: It's... it says "WAN" next to it, I think?

Agent: Okay, that's the wide area network port. That's actually pretty common if the modem is having trouble connecting to our network. Let me just pull up some diagnostics on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm checking to see if there's any issue on our network side. (pause) Hmm. 

Customer: What? Is something wrong?

Agent: No, no, I don't see any outages in your area from the storm or anything like that. But I am noticing that your modem might not be syncing properly with our network. Let me have you try something. Can you unplug the modem—just the modem this time, not the router?

Customer: Okay. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Leave it unplugged for about a full minute this time. Sometimes a longer reset helps.

Customer: (pause) Alright. One minute... (longer pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Good. And while that's booting up, let me check your account notes to see if there's anything else I should know.

Customer: How long does this usually take?

Agent: Should be about two to three minutes for a full boot. You doing okay?

Customer: Yeah, yeah. It's just frustrating, you know? I've got this deadline today.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll get this sorted out. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your service history here. I see you've had solid service. This is definitely unusual. (pause) How's that modem looking now?

Customer: Um... the internet light is still blinking. Same as before. The yellow one's still on too.

Agent: Alright. This is odd. We may be dealing with a couple of things here. Let me try a factory reset. I'm going to walk you through it. On the back of the modem, there should be a small button—usually recessed. Do you see it?

Customer: On the back? Let me... (pause) There's this tiny button here. Really small.

Agent: That's the one. Using something like a paperclip or a pen, I need you to press and hold that for about ten seconds. This is going to completely restart the modem and clear any settings.

Customer: Okay... (pause) I'm holding it down. One... two... three... (longer pause) ...and it's resetting. The lights just went out and came back on.

Agent: Good. Now let's let that boot up again.

Customer: (pause) Okay. We're at like two minutes now.

Agent: Any luck?

Customer: No. Still blinking. This is... I don't know what's going on.

Agent: I know this is frustrating. Unfortunately, it sounds like we might have a hardware issue with your modem. The light pattern you're describing—the persistent blinking on the WAN port and the yellow light—typically indicates that the modem isn't syncing with our network properly.

Customer: So... so what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, I have a couple of options for you. The first would be to have a technician come out to your location. They could test the line and replace the modem if needed. That would probably be the quickest solution.

Customer: How long would that take? Can someone come out today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our technician availability. (pause) I'm showing that we could have someone out to you... it looks like we have a window tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. But today would be pretty tight. We're pretty booked this afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need this working today.

Agent: I understand. Let me see if there's anything I can do. (pause) I can put you down as a priority appointment and we might be able to get someone out this evening, but I can't guarantee it. You'd be on a call list.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, yeah, I'll take it. I mean... I need to get this working.

Agent: Alright. Let me get that set up for you. Your address is still 447 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: And your phone number?

Customer: 555-0142.

Agent: Perfect. So I've got you down as a priority service call for today if we can fit you in, otherwise tomorrow 1 to 5 PM. Is there anything else I can help you with while we wait?

Customer: (pause) No, I... I guess I'm just stuck. Is there anything I can do on my end to... I don't know, try to get it working?

Agent: Honestly, at this point I think a technician visit is really your best bet. I've tried the standard troubleshooting steps and the modem just isn't connecting to our network. It could be a line issue on our side too, but I can't diagnose that from here.

Customer: Alright. So I should just... wait?

Agent: Yeah. You'll get a call from our dispatch team within the next couple hours if we can get someone out today. If not, you're locked in for tomorrow. Worst case, you've got service by tomorrow evening.

Customer: (pause) Okay. I guess that's... I guess that's fine. Thank you for trying anyway, Derek.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone, Michael. That technician will definitely be able to help you. And again, we'll try to get someone out today.

Customer: Yeah, thanks.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your patience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
