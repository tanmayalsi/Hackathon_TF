# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet isn't working at all. I've been without service since this morning and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I'm showing you're at 428 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, I'm gonna walk you through some troubleshooting steps to see if we can get you back up and running. First, can you tell me—is your modem powered on right now? Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Um... (pause) yeah, the modem is on. It's got some lights, but I think they're red? Or maybe orange? I'm not really sure.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the modem is powered on, which is good. Do you have the router as well, or are you just using the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I have the router too. It's separate.

Agent: Great. And is that one powered on as well?

Customer: Yes, both of them are on.

Agent: Okay, perfect. Let me ask you this—when you say your internet isn't working, are you not getting any connection at all, or is it just really slow?

Customer: No connection. I can't even pull up a webpage or anything. My laptop won't connect to the WiFi, and when I try to plug in an ethernet cable, that doesn't work either.

Agent: Alright, so nothing's connecting. That tells me a lot. Let's do this—I'm gonna have you restart both devices. Let's start with the modem first. Can you unplug the power cable from the back for me?

Customer: Okay, (pause) yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds before you plug it back in. While we're waiting, let me just check something on my end. (typing sounds) Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: Okay, I'm plugging it back in. (pause) It's lighting up again. It's still got that orange color though.

Agent: Yeah, that's normal when it's starting up. It should turn solid green or blue in just a moment. Give it about a minute to fully boot. While that's happening, let's go ahead and restart your router too. Can you unplug that one as well?

Customer: Sure. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and wait about thirty seconds on that one too, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's plugged back in now.

Agent: Good. Now let's just give these a minute or two to fully come back online. (pause) While we wait, let me ask—have you had any recent weather or anything like that? Sometimes storms can affect our lines.

Customer: Actually, now that you mention it, there was a pretty bad storm last night. Do you think that could've knocked something out?

Agent: It's definitely possible. Weather can sometimes cause temporary outages in the area, but usually that clears up on its own. Let me check our system real quick to see if there are any outages reported in your area. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not showing any active outages at your location right now, so that's a good sign.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: Alright, so the devices should be coming back online now. Can you check your laptop and try to connect to the WiFi again? Do you see your network name showing up?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I can see my WiFi network. Let me try to connect... (pause) I'm entering my password... (pause) Okay, it says it's connected, but I'm not getting any internet.

Agent: Hmm, okay. So the WiFi is connecting, but no internet. Let me try something else. Can you try using an ethernet cable directly from the modem to your laptop?

Customer: I don't have one readily available, but I think there might be one in a drawer. Give me a second. (pause, background noise of drawers opening and closing) Okay, I found one. (pause) Plugging it in now.

Agent: Alright, let me know once it's connected.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's connected. I'm opening my browser and... (pause) nope, still nothing. The page won't load.

Agent: Alright, I see. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at the modem status and... actually, I'm not seeing a connection coming in from your address right now. That suggests it might be an issue with the line itself rather than your equipment.

Customer: What does that mean? Is something wrong with the line?

Agent: It could be a few things. It might be a damaged line from the storm, or there could be an issue at our distribution point. Have you looked outside to see if there's any visible damage to the cables or anything?

Customer: Um... I mean, I can go check real quick.

Agent: That would be helpful, yeah.

Customer: (pause, background noise of door opening) Okay, I'm looking around... I don't really see anything that looks obviously broken. There's cables and stuff, but they look fine to me.

Agent: Okay, that's good. Let me try one more thing here. Can you go back to your modem and tell me what the lights are doing now? Are they all solid?

Customer: (pause) Let me see... the power light is green now, but there's a light that says "Online" and that one is... not on. It's off.

Agent: Okay, so the Online light isn't lit up. That confirms what I'm seeing on my end. There's no signal coming through on the line. (pause) Unfortunately, this is something we're going to need a technician to look at in person. It's likely a problem with the connection coming into your house.

Customer: Wait, so I have to wait for a technician? How long is that gonna take? I need my internet working.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get you scheduled for a technician visit. I can likely get someone out there tomorrow or the next day. Let me pull up our availability. (typing sounds) What time works best for you?

Customer: Um, I work from home, so really any time is fine. The sooner the better, honestly.

Agent: I hear you. Let me see what we have... (pause) Okay, I can get a technician scheduled to come out tomorrow between 2 and 6 PM. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works. Will they be able to fix it?

Agent: In most cases, yes. If it's a line issue, they can repair or replace the damaged section. If there's something else going on, they'll be able to diagnose it properly. (pause) I'm just gonna give you a confirmation number for this appointment. Can you grab a pen?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay.

Agent: Your confirmation number is 447829. That's 4-4-7-8-2-9. The technician will arrive tomorrow between 2 and 6 PM. Is there a phone number they can call if they need to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's the same number I gave you.

Agent: Perfect. Just to recap, we've done all the troubleshooting we can do on the phone, and it appears to be a line-level issue that a technician needs to assess. They'll give you a call before they arrive tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just really hope they can get this fixed quickly.

Agent: I understand, and I'm sure they'll get you taken care of. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks for your help.

Agent: Thank you so much for your patience, and thanks for being a Frontier customer. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
