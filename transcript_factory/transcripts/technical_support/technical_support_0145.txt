# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I work from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be, especially when you're working from home. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that now. And your name is?

Customer: James. James Morrison.

Agent: Great, James. I've got you here. So the internet's been down since this morning? When did you first notice it wasn't working?

Customer: Around 8 AM, I think. I was trying to log into a meeting and nothing was loading. I tried restarting my router, but that didn't help.

Agent: Okay, that's a good first step that you already tried. Let me ask you a few questions. Are you seeing any lights on the modem right now? Any lights at all?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, actually, there's a red light. It's steady red on the front.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful. So the modem is powered on but we're seeing that red indicator. Can you tell me which light is red? Is it the power light or is it one of the other lights?

Customer: Uh, I'm looking at it now. It's... it looks like it's the one that says "internet" or something like that. Yeah, the internet light is red.

Agent: Okay, perfect. That tells me the modem is powered up but it's not connecting to our network. Let me try a couple of things here. First, can you check the cable that goes from the modem into the wall? Just make sure it's plugged in all the way on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... it looks like it's plugged in pretty tight. Should I unplug it and plug it back in?

Agent: You know what, let's do that. Go ahead and unplug it from the wall outlet, not the modem itself, and just wait about ten seconds.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Unplugging now... (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now just count to ten for me.

Customer: One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged back in. (pause) The lights are coming back on... red light's back.

Agent: Alright, so we're still seeing that red internet light. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any service issues reported in your area, so it's likely something specific to your connection. Let me check your account status here... (pause) Okay, I'm seeing that your service should be active. Let me try to reboot your modem from here. This might take a minute.

Customer: Okay, how long is this gonna take?

Agent: Just a minute or two, James. Your modem might restart and the lights might go dark for a second, so just hang tight.

Customer: Alright, I'm just... I'm watching it now. The lights are... (pause) oh, they just went off.

Agent: Yep, that's normal. The modem's rebooting. It should come back up in about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) They're coming back on now.

Agent: And is that internet light still red?

Customer: (pause) Yeah... yeah, it's still red. This is... this is really frustrating.

Agent: I understand, James. I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Let me try a different approach. Have you had any recent weather, or... or anything unusual happen? Any storms or power outages last night?

Customer: Actually, yeah, now that you mention it, we did have a pretty bad storm last night. Power went out for a bit. I didn't think it would affect anything though.

Agent: That could definitely be related. Power surges can sometimes damage the equipment. Let me ask you this—when you look at the back of the modem, do you see any burnt marks or anything that looks... out of the ordinary?

Customer: (pause) I mean... (pause) not that I can see, no. Looks normal to me.

Agent: Okay. Well, let me check your line status one more time. (typing sounds) (pause) James, I'm seeing something here that might be the issue. It looks like there might be a problem with the connection coming into your home from our side. This could be something with the fiber line or the connection point.

Customer: Wait, so it's not my equipment?

Agent: It doesn't appear to be. Your modem and router seem to be functioning normally based on what I'm seeing. But without a signal coming from our network, the modem can't establish that connection. I think we might need to schedule a technician to come out and check the lines.

Customer: How soon can someone come out? I really need this working. I've got important meetings all day tomorrow.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) I can schedule someone to come out tomorrow between 1 PM and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: It has to work, I guess. But is there anything else we can try right now? Like anything at all?

Agent: (pause) Let me try one more thing. Can you do me a favor and unplug the modem completely? I want you to leave it unplugged for a full minute this time. Don't plug anything back in.

Customer: Okay... (unplugging sounds) It's unplugged.

Agent: Alright. And just let it sit for a full minute.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, it's been a minute. Now what?

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in and let me know once all the lights are back on.

Customer: (plugging in sounds) (pause) Lights are powering up... (pause) Okay, they're all on. Internet light is... (pause) still red.

Agent: Yeah, I figured as much. I'm sorry, James. I think at this point we need to get a tech out there to diagnose the issue. It's almost certainly something external to your modem and router. 

Customer: (sighs) Alright. Yeah, go ahead and book that appointment.

Agent: Perfect. So I have you down for tomorrow, [inaudible] between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will come out and check the line. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour or so. In the meantime, if you want to try anything else, you can always restart your router—that's the separate device—but honestly, I think the issue is on our end. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully your tech can figure it out tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sure they will. I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved today. We'll get you back up and running. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
