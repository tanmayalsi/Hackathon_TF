# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up and running. I'm working from home and I've got a meeting in like an hour.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be, especially when you need it for work. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So your internet went down this morning?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around like 8 or 8:30. I woke up and tried to check my emails and nothing. The modem's just... I don't know, it's not working.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Before we dive in, let me just check if there are any outages in your area. (pause) I'm not seeing any active outages reported, so that's good news. That usually means we can get this resolved pretty quickly. Let me ask you a few questions. Is your modem powered on right now?

Customer: Um, yeah. I mean, it's plugged in. The lights on it are... they're not showing what they normally show. Usually there's like a green light, and right now it's just... I think it's yellow or orange or something?

Agent: Okay, so the status light is showing orange instead of green. That's helpful. And do you see any other lights on the modem at all?

Customer: There's like a little light that's blinking, yeah. I think it's the power light, maybe?

Agent: Alright, let's try a basic restart. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out of the back.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds. This helps clear the modem's memory. Just... (trailing off) take a breath. I know this is frustrating.

Customer: (background noise of television) Yeah, no, I appreciate it. How much longer do you think this'll take? Like I said, I've got that meeting...

Agent: Totally understand. This should just take a few minutes. We're at about thirty seconds now, so go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: Plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait for it to boot up. This can take a minute or so. You should see the lights come back on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see the power light again. It's still... it's still kind of that orange color. But now there's another light that's blinking red.

Agent: A red light? Okay, that's... that usually indicates a connection issue. Let me ask you—do you see the cable that connects the modem to the wall outlet? The coax cable?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's connected.

Agent: Can you check and make sure it's screwed in all the way? Sometimes these can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) I'm checking now. It feels pretty tight to me, but let me see if I can... (sounds of movement) Yeah, it seems like it's already tight.

Agent: Alright, no problem. Let me try something else. Do you have a router separate from your modem, or is it an all-in-one unit?

Customer: I think it's just the one box. It's the thing you guys installed like... I want to say six months ago?

Agent: Okay, so it should be a combo unit then. Perfect. Now, I want you to look at the back of the modem and tell me if you see a small button that might say "reset" on it.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's a little button that says reset.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to have you hold that for about ten to fifteen seconds. But fair warning—this will reset the modem to factory settings, so we might have to go through a setup process after. Are you comfortable doing that?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, let's try it. What's the worst that could happen, right?

Agent: (slight laugh) That's the spirit. Go ahead whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Holding it down... ten, eleven, twelve... fifteen seconds. Okay, I'm releasing it now.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it another couple of minutes to fully reboot. While we're waiting, let me just ask—have you experienced any issues with your internet before this? Any weird outages or slow speeds?

Customer: Not really, no. It's been pretty solid up until this morning. Like I said, I just woke up and turned on my computer and there was nothing.

Agent: That's good to know. Okay, so are you seeing any changes in the lights now?

Customer: (pause) Um... still orange. And that red light is still blinking too. It's been like... it's been like three, four minutes now?

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm, okay. Let me check something on my end. (pause) I'm looking at our system and I'm not seeing a connection from your unit to our network. That's unusual.

Customer: What does that mean? Like, is something broken?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be an issue with the modem itself, or it could be an issue with the line coming into your home. Let me ask you this—when you look outside or wherever your cable connection comes into your house, do you see anything unusual? Any cuts or [inaudible]?

Customer: I... I'm not really sure where that is exactly. Is it like in the basement or...?

Agent: It could be in the basement, on the outside of your house, could be in a utility box nearby. But if you're not comfortable checking that, don't worry about it. Let me try one more thing from my end here. (typing sounds) I'm going to try to manually trigger a connection on our servers.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Is that... is that something that'll fix it?

Agent: It might. Sometimes the signal just needs a little push to recognize the modem. Let me give that a moment to process. (pause) Let's give it about thirty seconds and then check your modem lights again.

Customer: (pause) Alright. (pause) Still the same. Orange light, red blinking light. I'm... I'm getting a little worried here. Like, how long is this usually going to take?

Agent: I know, I know. I understand your concern. Look, I've tried the standard troubleshooting steps and the modem should be connecting but it's not responding on our end. At this point, I think we might be dealing with either a hardware issue with the modem itself or potentially something with the line.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, what's the next step?

Agent: The next step would be to get a technician out to your home. They can diagnose the actual issue—whether it's the modem that needs replacing or if there's something with the line. Unfortunately, I can't get your internet working remotely at this point.

Customer: (frustrated) A technician? How long would that take? I need this working today. I've got meetings and I have to [inaudible] clients.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our tech schedule for you. (pause) (typing sounds) The earliest I can get someone out is... looks like we have availability tomorrow morning between 10 AM and 12 PM, or we have an afternoon slot at 2 PM tomorrow.

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... that's not ideal. Like, is there anything else we can try right now?

Agent: (pause) I wish I had better news. I've walked through all the standard troubleshooting steps—power cycle, reset, line checks—and the modem isn't connecting to our network. Without the technician being physically there to test the equipment and the line, I'm not able to pinpoint the exact issue. I don't want to keep you on the phone troubleshooting steps that won't resolve this.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Yeah... I guess you're right. So it's probably the modem then? Or do you think it's something else?

Agent: Honestly, it could be either one. The red light usually indicates a connection issue, which could mean the modem isn't receiving signal properly, or it could mean the signal isn't getting to it. The tech will be able to test it and let you know for sure.

Customer: And they'll bring a new modem if that's the problem?

Agent: They should have replacement equipment with them, yes. But they'll need to diagnose it first. Can you do tomorrow? Would morning or afternoon work better for you?

Customer: (pause) Morning, I guess. That way I can at least hopefully get it working before the end of the business day.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get you set up for that. (typing sounds) I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, March 14th, between 10 AM and 12 PM. Our technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive. Your confirmation number is 847-F-9. Do you have something to write that down?

Customer: Yeah, I got it. 847-F-9. (pause) Alright. I'm really hoping this gets fixed tomorrow because this is costing me work time today.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I'm truly sorry we couldn't resolve this today. Is there anything else I can help clarify about the appointment?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully your tech can get this fixed.

Agent: I'm confident they'll take good care of you. Thank you for your patience, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. You have a good day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
