Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I'm working from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that must be, especially when you're trying to work. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment... And just to confirm, is this the service address on file at 342 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet is completely down right now. Can you tell me what you're seeing? Do you have any lights on your router or modem?

Customer: Um, yeah, so the modem—it's got the power light on, that's green. But the internet light is... it's red. And it's not blinking or anything, it's just solid red.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The solid red light typically means there's no connection being detected on the line. Let me ask you—have you tried unplugging the modem and router and waiting a few minutes before plugging them back in?

Customer: No, I haven't done that yet. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, let's start there. Go ahead and unplug the modem first, and then unplug the router. We'll wait about 30 seconds and then plug them back in. The modem first, and then the router.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging now... (sound of objects being moved) Alright, they're both unplugged.

Agent: Good. Let's give it about... thirty seconds or so.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, that should be about thirty seconds.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first, please.

Customer: (plugging sound) Yeah, it's plugged in. The lights are coming back on... the power light's green again.

Agent: Good, and now go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (plugging sound) Okay, router's plugged in. Let me give it a second to boot up... (pause) Still just the red light on the internet connection though.

Agent: Okay. And do you know how long this usually takes to light up? Generally it should take maybe 45 seconds to a minute or so.

Customer: Right, yeah. Let me wait a bit longer... (pause) ...still red. It's been about a minute now.

Agent: Alright, let's try a few more things. Can you check the cables for me? There should be a cable running from the wall outlet into the modem. Can you make sure that's nice and snug?

Customer: (sound of movement) Yeah, so there's a cable running from the wall jack to the back of the modem... let me check it. It seems pretty... wait, actually it does feel a little loose. Let me tighten it.

Agent: Good catch. Go ahead and make sure it's as tight as you can get it.

Customer: (grunting slightly) Yeah, okay. It's tighter now. Let me check the light... (pause) ...still red, unfortunately.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Can you also check the cable on the other end? The one going into the router from the modem?

Customer: Yeah, one sec... (sound of movement) That one feels pretty solid actually. They both seem connected now.

Agent: Alright, let's give it another minute or two to see if the light changes.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, it's still... still red. I've been waiting a couple minutes now and nothing's changed.

Agent: Okay. Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm not showing any service alerts in your area, so that's good news. But I am seeing that your modem did sync briefly about forty minutes ago and then dropped off. That timing lines up with when you noticed the outage?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right, actually.

Agent: Let me try to send a reset signal to your modem from here. This might take a couple minutes. Just keep an eye on those lights for me.

Customer: Okay, I'm watching them now. (pause) ...nothing yet. (pause) Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, let me try that reset again. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm sending it now.

Customer: (pause, sound of movement) Still red. I don't think it worked.

Agent: Yeah, I'm not seeing it respond on my end either, which is a bit unusual. Let me ask you—have there been any storms in your area recently? Any power outages?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of, no. It was clear this morning when I noticed it.

Agent: Okay. And you haven't made any changes to your setup recently? No new equipment or anything?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine this morning.

Agent: Alright. (pause) I'd like to try one more thing here. I'm going to have you do what we call a factory reset on the modem. This will clear any settings, so just be aware of that. Are you comfortable trying that?

Customer: I guess so, yeah. How do I do it?

Agent: There should be a small reset button on the back of the modem. You'll need something like a paperclip or a pen to press it. Hold it down for about ten to fifteen seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me find a... (sound of searching) Okay, I've got a paperclip. (sound of movement) I'm looking at the back of the modem... I see a small button that says "Reset." Is that it?

Agent: That's the one. Go ahead and press and hold it for about ten to fifteen seconds.

Customer: (sound of button press) Okay, I'm holding it... (pause) ...still holding... (pause) ...okay, I think that's about fifteen seconds. Let me let go.

Agent: Good. The modem should reboot now. You might see the lights flash or change. Let's give it a minute or two to fully reboot.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, it's rebooting. I see the lights doing their thing... they're all blinking now actually, which is different. (pause) And... okay, it seems to be settling down. The power light's green again, but the internet light is still... still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's frustrating. I'm looking at the modem status here on my end, and I'm still not seeing it connect to the network. At this point, I think we might have an issue with either the modem itself or there could be a line issue that I can't see from here.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can we fix it?

Agent: Well, let me see what I can do. The next step would be to have one of our technicians come out and physically check the line and the equipment. They'd be able to do a more thorough diagnosis than I can do over the phone.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back today if possible.

Agent: Let me check our availability... (typing sounds, pause) I'm looking at our service appointments for today. It looks like we have a technician who could come out between 2 and 4 PM this afternoon. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, 2 to 4 works for me. Can you make sure they know it's urgent?

Agent: Absolutely. I've flagged this as a priority. The tech will be aware that you need internet restored. Is 342 Maple Street the address where they should come?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And they'll have your phone number on file, so they may call a few minutes before they arrive. Is the best number to reach you 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell phone, so that should be fine.

Agent: Great. I want to apologize again for the trouble today. Before the technician gets there, if you want to try one more thing—and this is completely optional—you could try unplugging everything again and waiting five minutes before plugging back in. Sometimes that helps, but I don't want to give you false hope. 

Customer: Yeah, I can give that a shot, I guess.

Agent: Okay. So to recap, you have a technician scheduled for 2 to 4 PM today at 342 Maple Street. They'll contact you before arriving. In the meantime, just monitor that modem. Do you have any other questions for me?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I really hope they can fix it. I've got meetings this afternoon I need to join.

Agent: I completely understand. Hopefully the technician will have you back up and running quickly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you this afternoon.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
