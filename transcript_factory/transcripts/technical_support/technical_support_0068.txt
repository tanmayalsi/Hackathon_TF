Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so uh... my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got work stuff I need to do and it's kind of urgent.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage—it's not working at all right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. My router's on, the lights are blinking and everything, but I'm not getting any connection. I checked all the cables and they seem fine.

Agent: Good, good. That's helpful that you've already checked that. So the router is powered on and you're seeing the lights... which lights are you seeing? Are they green, red, or amber colored?

Customer: Um, there's a green light on top, and then there's like... I think it's an orange or amber light that's blinking pretty fast on one of the other ports.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is solid green, and you're seeing a blinking amber light on another port. That amber light usually indicates that the connection to our network might not be established. Let me have you try a couple of things. First, can you locate the reset button on the back of your router? It's usually a small recessed button.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's like a tiny little button, right?

Agent: Exactly. Okay, so I'm going to have you hold that for about thirty seconds while the router's powered on. That'll perform a soft reset. Go ahead and do that now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, holding it... okay, it's resetting. (pause) The lights are all going crazy now... and we're waiting...

Agent: Yeah, that's normal. This should take about a minute or two to fully reboot. While that's happening, just out of curiosity, did anything change with your setup recently? New equipment, storm activity, anything like that?

Customer: No, not really. We had some lightning a couple weeks ago but the internet was fine after that. This morning I just woke up and everything was offline.

Agent: Uh-huh. Okay, and you're not seeing any physical damage to any of the cables or the equipment?

Customer: No, everything looks fine.

Agent: (pause) Alright, is the router back up now?

Customer: Um... yeah, I think so. The green light is back to solid, but that amber light is still blinking like crazy.

Agent: Still blinking amber, okay. That's... (pause) Let me try something else. Can you unplug the ethernet cable that connects your router to the modem? There should be a gray cable running between the two devices.

Customer: Oh, I didn't realize there was a separate modem. Let me look... uh, yeah, I see it. There's a white box next to the router.

Agent: That's the one. Go ahead and unplug that ethernet cable for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now wait about ten seconds, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in... (pause) Hmm, the lights on the modem are doing weird stuff now.

Agent: What do you mean by weird? What are you seeing?

Customer: The lights are like... really bright orange, and they're flickering. One of them went red for a second.

Agent: (pause) Okay, James, I'm looking at our network here and... let me check for any outages in your area. Can you give me your service address?

Customer: It's 442 Maple Street, Apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Let me see... 442 Maple... (pause) Okay, I'm not showing any active outages in your area. That's... (pause) The modem, when you look at it, is there a port that says "Internet" or "WAN" on it? There should be a cable coming in from the wall.

Customer: Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's a cable coming in from the wall. That's still plugged in.

Agent: Okay, good. Can you unplug that cable from the wall port and plug it back in as well?

Customer: (pause) Alright, did that. (pause) Same thing though—the lights are just going all orange and red. This doesn't look right.

Agent: Yeah, I understand. (pause) Okay, let me have you try something. Can you power cycle the modem completely? Unplug the power cable from the back for about thirty seconds.

Customer: Sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) How long was that supposed to be?

Agent: Thirty seconds should do it. You can go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in... (pause) Okay, the lights are going through their startup sequence... and... (pause) ...we're still getting that red and orange. This is weird.

Agent: (pause) I know this is frustrating. The modem should be showing a solid green light within about three minutes of powering on. The fact that it's showing red... (pause) Let me ask you this—when you look at the cable coming in from the wall, does it look damaged in any way? Any fraying, kinks, anything like that?

Customer: No, it looks fine. It's tucked pretty neatly actually.

Agent: Okay. (pause) James, I'm going to be honest with you. The red light on the modem is typically indicating that we're not getting a valid signal from our equipment on our end. This could be a few things. It could be a bad modem, it could be an issue with the line to your unit, or it could be something on our network that I'm not seeing yet.

Customer: Okay... so what do we do?

Agent: (pause) I think at this point, we're going to need to send a technician out to your location to do a physical inspection of the line and potentially swap out the modem. How does your schedule look? We have technician availability... let me see here... (typing sounds) ...we have morning slots available tomorrow, or we can schedule for later in the week if that doesn't work.

Customer: (sighs) Tomorrow morning would be better than later in the week. I really need this fixed soon.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get you scheduled. We'll have someone out between 8 AM and 12 PM tomorrow. Can I get a callback number?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Perfect. So to confirm, James, we've got you down for a technician visit tomorrow morning between 8 and noon at 442 Maple Street, Apartment 3B. You should receive a confirmation email and a text message shortly. In the meantime, I'd just leave the modem and router powered on so we can continue to monitor things remotely, okay?

Customer: Alright, I will. I really appreciate you trying to figure this out.

Agent: Of course. I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved over the phone today, but our tech team is excellent and they should be able to get you back online quickly. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
