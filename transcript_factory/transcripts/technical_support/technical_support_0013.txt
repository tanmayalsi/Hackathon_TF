# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet has been out since this morning and I really need to get it back up and running. I work from home and I have calls scheduled.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here... Alright, I see your account. And you said your internet went down this morning?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 AM. I was checking emails and everything just... stopped. The modem's still on, the lights are on, but nothing's working.

Agent: Got it. Okay, so first things first—let me just confirm what I'm seeing here. You're in the Columbus area, correct?

Customer: That's right, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. And just to rule out the basics, is your modem powered on? Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on the front of it?

Customer: Um, okay, let me look... (pause) There's a green light on the left, and then there's a... I think a yellow or orange one in the middle? And another green one on the right.

Agent: Okay, so you've got the power light, that's good. Is the internet light—usually that's the one in the middle—is it solid green or is it blinking?

Customer: It's... it's orange and it's blinking.

Agent: Alright, that's actually telling us something. When that light is orange and blinking, typically that means the modem is searching for a connection to our network. Have you tried doing a hard reset on the modem yet?

Customer: No, I didn't want to mess anything up.

Agent: No, that's totally fine. That's actually a pretty common troubleshooting step. What I'd like you to do is—and don't worry, this won't cause any problems—unplug the modem from the power outlet, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. I'll hold here while you do that.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. Should I count to 30 or...?

Agent: You can if you'd like, or just wait until you feel comfortable. There's no exact science to it, but we like to give it a solid 30 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been like a minute. Plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's... the lights are coming back on.

Agent: Great. So give it about a minute to fully boot back up. We should see that orange light turn green once it reconnects.

Customer: (pause) ...It's still orange.

Agent: Still orange? Okay. Is it still blinking or is it solid now?

Customer: Still blinking.

Agent: Hmm, alright. Let me check a couple things on my end. (typing sounds) So I'm not seeing any service alerts in your area, but let me check if there are any issues on the network... (pause) One second, I'm gonna check the modem's signal levels here.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, so I'm showing... actually, the signal is pretty low. Have you noticed any weather issues today? Sometimes heavy rain or storms can affect the connection.

Customer: It was a little cloudy this morning, but nothing crazy. No rain or anything.

Agent: Okay. Well, the signal being low could indicate an issue with either the line coming into your house or potentially the modem itself. Let's try a couple more things. Can you tell me where your modem is located?

Customer: It's in my office, upstairs. It's right by the router actually.

Agent: Okay, so you have a separate router? That's fine. Um, let me ask—have you checked the cable that runs from the wall outlet into your modem? Sometimes those can get a little loose or... you know, sometimes pets or kids will mess with them. Can you just visually confirm that the cable is plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks fine to me. Both ends are plugged in pretty tight.

Agent: Alright. Okay, and just to double-check—you're not seeing any damage on the cable itself, right? No cuts or anything?

Customer: No, it looks fine.

Agent: Good. Alright, so here's what I'm thinking. The low signal levels combined with the orange blinking light suggests there might be an issue between our line and your modem. Have you experienced any outages in the past or any recent weather damage?

Customer: Not that I know of, no.

Agent: (typing) Let me see if there's anything else I can check here. (pause) Hmm. Okay, I'm gonna have you try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem again, but this time also unplug the power cable to the router? Then wait about 30 seconds and plug them both back in, starting with the modem first.

Customer: Both of them?

Agent: Yeah, sometimes if the router gets into a weird state it can cause issues, even though it looks like the problem is upstream. Let's just reset the whole thing.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Unplugging modem... and router... (pause) Both unplugged now.

Agent: Great. Just take your time there.

Customer: (pause) Alright, 30 seconds is up. Plugging the modem back in first. (pause) Okay. Now the router. (pause) Okay, they're both on now.

Agent: Alright. Let's give it about two minutes to fully boot this time. Sometimes the router takes a little longer when you're doing a cold boot.

Customer: (pause) ...Alright, so the modem light is... still orange. Still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Still blinking orange. Okay. (typing sounds) Yeah, so... I hate to be the bearer of bad news here, but at this point what we're looking at is likely either a problem with the connection from our network to your house, or it could be an issue with the modem itself. I'm not able to fully resolve this over the phone.

Customer: What do you mean? Like, it's broken?

Agent: It could be, or it could be something with the line outside. Honestly, with the signal levels being this low and the modem not connecting after those resets, we'd need a technician to come out and do some physical diagnostics.

Customer: (sighs) So I can't get this fixed today?

Agent: Well, let me see what we can do. (typing sounds) What does your schedule look like? I can potentially get a technician out to you... (pause) We have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or... it looks like we might have a same-day window if you can do between 4 and 6 PM this evening?

Customer: (pause) The evening works better. Can they make it?

Agent: Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I have a technician scheduled to arrive at your address between 4 and 6 PM this evening. You should get a confirmation text and email in the next few minutes with all the details.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. So they'll be able to fix it?

Agent: They'll be able to diagnose what's going on and determine the best course of action. There's a good chance they can get you back up and running, but if it is the modem, we can provide a replacement. You'll find out more when they arrive.

Customer: Okay. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved remotely, but you should be all set for this evening. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's... that's it. Thank you.

Agent: Alright, thanks for calling Frontier, and sorry again for the inconvenience.

Customer: No problem. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
