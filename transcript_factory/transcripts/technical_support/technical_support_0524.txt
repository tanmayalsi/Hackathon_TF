Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got a bunch of stuff I need to do for work.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. 201 Maple.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Just to get a clear picture here, is everything completely down, or are you seeing any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um, well, the modem... let me look. Yeah, the modem has a couple lights on it. There's like, a green light, I think, but the internet light—I don't know which one that is, honestly.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the green light is good. What about the router? Do you see any lights on that?

Customer: The router? Yeah, it's got some lights. They're all red though, which... that doesn't seem good.

Agent: Yeah, that's what we want to check out. Red lights on the router typically mean there's a connection issue between the modem and the router. Let's try the basics first. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, doing that now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And go ahead and unplug the router as well.

Customer: Alright, one second. (pause) Okay, unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about 30 seconds for everything to fully power down.

Customer: (pause) Yep, waiting...

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in... okay, it's back in. Lights are coming on.

Agent: Good. Give that about a minute to fully boot up, and then go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, the router's plugged back in too. (pause) So... should I be seeing something different?

Agent: Give it just another minute or so to fully boot up. Sometimes it takes a little while for everything to sync back together.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, I'm looking at it... the modem still has that green light, but the router... yeah, the lights are still red. Pretty sure they're all red.

Agent: Hmm, okay. (pause) Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any service disruptions in your area, so that's good news. Can you tell me what kind of router you have? Is it one of ours that we provided?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I think so. It's... let me look at the back... it says Frontier on it.

Agent: Okay, good. And just to double-check—you're sure the internet cable is plugged in? The one that goes from the modem to the router?

Customer: (pause) Oh. (pause) Um... let me check. (pause) Oh, okay, I see it. Yeah, it's plugged in.

Agent: Alright. And the cable looks okay? Like, it's not damaged or anything?

Customer: Looks fine to me. It's pretty standard looking.

Agent: Okay. And just for completeness, the power cable on the modem is... that's definitely fully seated in there?

Customer: Yeah, I just plugged it back in, so...

Agent: Right, right. Let me try something here. On the modem itself, you should see a small reset button—usually it's recessed. Do you see that?

Customer: Um... (pause) Where would that be exactly?

Agent: Usually it's on the back of the modem, and it's really tiny. You might need to use something like a paperclip to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking... yeah, I see it. I think. It's a real small one on the back?

Agent: That's the one. Go ahead and hold that down for about 10 seconds with a paperclip or something similar.

Customer: (pause) Alright, holding it... (pause) ...and releasing. (pause) Okay, now what?

Agent: Now let's wait for the modem to boot back up. That'll take a minute or two.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, yeah, it's booting up. The lights are... it looks the same as before though. Green light on the modem, and the router is... still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let me check your service status here. (typing sounds) I'm checking the line and... hm. (pause) Actually, I'm showing some activity on your line that's a little unusual. Have you noticed anything else going on? Like, has the modem been making any weird sounds or getting hot?

Customer: No, it seems fine. It's not hot or anything. It's in my closet, so...

Agent: Okay. This might be a hardware issue on our end. Let me pull up your history here. (typing sounds) How long have you had this modem?

Customer: Honestly, I don't even remember. Years at this point. Maybe... five years? I'm not sure.

Agent: Okay, so this unit has been with you for quite a while. It's possible the modem itself is starting to fail. That would definitely explain why your router isn't getting a signal from it.

Customer: So what do I... what do I do about that?

Agent: [inaudible] ...let me just try one more thing before we go down that route. I'm going to reset your line from our system. This'll take just a moment. (pause) Okay, I'm doing that now. Give it about two minutes to complete, and then check your router lights again.

Customer: (long pause) Two minutes... okay. (pause) ...checking it now. (pause) Still red.

Agent: Still red, yeah? Okay. (pause) Unfortunately, it does sound like we might be dealing with a modem that's reached the end of its life. These things typically last about four to five years, and after that, they can start having communication issues.

Customer: So you're saying I need a new modem?

Agent: That does seem to be what's happening here. I can definitely arrange to have a new one shipped out to you, or you can come in to one of our locations and pick one up today if you need internet right away.

Customer: How long would shipping take?

Agent: It typically takes about three to five business days depending on your location.

Customer: (pause) That's... a long time. Can I just come pick one up?

Agent: Absolutely. We have a location just off Commerce Drive. They're open until 6 PM today if you want to swing by.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that might be... that might be better. Do I need to do anything or just go in?

Agent: Just head in and let them know you need a replacement modem. I'm going to make a note on your account right now so they have everything ready for you. Just give them your phone number or account number and they'll take care of you.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Alright, well... thanks, I guess. I just hope this fixes it.

Agent: I'm pretty confident this will get you back up and running. These modems are pretty reliable until they start to go, and all the signs point to this being a hardware failure on the modem itself rather than anything with your service.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Well, I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. And hey, if you do pick up that new modem and you're still having issues, just give us a call back and we'll walk you through the setup.

Customer: Sounds good. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, and sorry again for the trouble today.

Customer: No problem. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
