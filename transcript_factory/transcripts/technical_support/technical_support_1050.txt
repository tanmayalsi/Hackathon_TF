Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. My internet is completely down. I've had it for about two years now and this is the first real problem I've had, so I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm seeing the account for... Marcus Thompson at 412 Elmwood Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So your internet is completely down right now? No connection at all?

Customer: Nothing. I tried restarting the router about an hour ago and that didn't do anything. The lights on it are weird too. Normally they're all green and blinking, but now it's just... I don't know, the power light is on but the internet light isn't, I think.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. So the power light is on but you're not seeing the internet indicator light. Let me ask you a few quick questions. First, are you still looking at the router right now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm standing right here looking at it.

Agent: Great. Can you tell me what color the lights are that you're seeing?

Customer: Um, there's a white light on the front that says "Power" and then there's... (pause) ...looks like there's an amber light below it. That one's solid, not blinking.

Agent: Okay, an amber light is usually an indicator light showing an issue with the connection. Let me have you do a couple of things for me. First, I need you to look at the back of the modem—not the router, but the modem. Can you see where the cable comes in from outside?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. There's like, a bunch of cables back here.

Agent: Perfect. Can you check if that main cable from outside is still firmly plugged in? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Let me... yeah, it's plugged in pretty tight. I don't think that's it.

Agent: Alright, no problem. Let me have you do a full reset of the equipment. I'm going to have you unplug both the modem and the router for about thirty seconds, then plug the modem back in first, wait for it to boot up fully—that'll take a minute or two—and then plug the router back in. Can you do that?

Customer: Sure, yeah. (pause) Unplugging everything now. (pause) Okay, they're unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just give me one moment while I pull up some information on our end. (pause) We're actually going to want to wait about thirty seconds to give the equipment a chance to clear.

Customer: (pause) So... just standing here?

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, I know it's the worst part. Just about twenty more seconds. And you know what, just to make sure I have all the right information, when exactly did you first notice the internet went down?

Customer: This morning around 9 AM. I was working from home and it just... stopped. At first I thought maybe my laptop was the problem, so I checked my phone and nothing was connecting either.

Agent: Okay, so it's been down since around 9? And you tried the restart about an hour ago?

Customer: Yeah, about an hour ago.

Agent: Alright. Go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in... (pause) Okay, it's in.

Agent: Perfect. Now we're going to want to give it a minute and a half to fully boot up. You should see the lights starting to turn on and cycle through.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I can see stuff happening. Some lights are coming on. Okay, now... the power light is bright white, and I'm seeing like a green light that's blinking now.

Agent: That's a good sign! That's progress. Go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: (pause) Router's plugged in... (pause) Okay, and... (longer pause) ...lights are coming on. Um, I'm seeing different lights lighting up here but... (pause) ...the internet light is still amber. It's not green.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me check on our end if there's an outage in your area. (typing sounds) Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Sure.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any active outages in your area right now. Let me ask you this—do you see any other amber or red lights on the router? Any error indicators?

Customer: Just the one. The internet light. Everything else looks... mostly normal, I guess. There's like a WiFi light that's green and blinking.

Agent: Okay, so WiFi is powered but no internet connection. Let me try something else. I'm going to send a reset command to your modem from here. This is going to take just a moment, and you should see the lights flash. Ready?

Customer: Yeah, ready.

Agent: (pause) Sending it now... (pause) Do you see any activity?

Customer: (pause) The lights went through... like a cycle, I think. But um... it's back to the same thing. Amber light on the internet.

Agent: Okay, let me have you try one more thing. Do you know where your modem's reset button is? There should be a small button on the back—it might be recessed so you'd need a paperclip or something.

Customer: (pause) Oh yeah, I think I see it. It's like a tiny button on the back?

Agent: That's the one. Now, I want to warn you that if you press this, it's going to reset your modem completely, which means all your settings will be wiped. You'll need to reprogram it after. Are you okay with trying that?

Customer: Yeah, at this point I'll try anything. What do I do?

Agent: Take something small—a paperclip or ballpoint pen—and press that button and hold it for about ten seconds. You should see the lights cycle through again.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... (pause) ...and the lights are going crazy now. Let me... let me just wait for this to finish.

Agent: Take your time. This might take a couple minutes to fully reboot.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been a couple minutes now and... (sigh) ...we're back to amber again. Still just the amber light.

Agent: Alright. (pause) I'm going to be honest with you—that's typically what we'd try, and if that doesn't resolve it, it usually indicates either a service issue on our line or potentially a hardware failure with the modem itself. Let me look at your service status one more time here. (typing sounds) (pause)

Customer: Is that... bad?

Agent: Not necessarily. Let me check a couple other things. On your modem, there's usually a model number printed on the sticker. Can you read that to me?

Customer: Um, yeah. It says... "Frontier Fiber Modem FG2425-B."

Agent: (pause) Okay, so that's one of our standard models. (pause) You know what, I think at this point the best move is going to be to get a technician out to your location. There could be an issue with the line coming into your house, or it could be a hardware issue with the modem itself. But I want to make sure we get this resolved properly.

Customer: Okay, um, how long would that take? I work from home and I really need my internet back.

Agent: I understand. Let me see what availability we have. (pause) (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest we have an available technician is tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for your schedule?

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow? That's... not ideal, but I guess I don't have a choice. Is there anything else I can try tonight?

Agent: Unfortunately, we've gone through all the standard troubleshooting steps. At this point, trying anything else would likely just make things worse. The technician will be able to diagnose the actual problem when they get there. There's a good chance they might have a replacement modem with them if that's the issue.

Customer: Alright, I guess I'll just have to use my phone hotspot for tonight. Let me get that scheduled.

Agent: Absolutely. So I have you down for a technician visit tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. We'll send you a confirmation text and email at the address we have on file. The technician will call you about 15 minutes before they arrive. Does the number we have, 555-0147, is that still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved today, but I'm confident the technician will be able to take care of this for you tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, thanks for trying anyway. I appreciate you going through all those steps with me.

Agent: Of course. And hey, if anything changes before tomorrow or if you think of anything else, feel free to give us a call back anytime. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
