Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I work from home and I'm kind of losing it here.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's the number you're calling from, actually. 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. Just give me one second here... Alright, I have you pulled up. I'm showing a service address on Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So your internet went down this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 or 9 AM. I was just in the middle of a work call with my team and everything just... froze. Then I looked at my router and all the lights were off basically.

Agent: Got it. Okay, so when you say the lights were off, you mean on the router itself?

Customer: Yeah, the modem and router, both of them. Completely dark.

Agent: Alright, let me ask you a few questions. First, can you confirm that the power cables are plugged in securely to both devices? Sometimes they can get jostled loose.

Customer: (pause) Um, let me check. (sounds of movement) Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. The power cables look like they're in there pretty good.

Agent: Okay, good. And are there any lights on the devices at all right now?

Customer: No, nothing. It's like they're completely off.

Agent: Hmm. Can you try unplugging the power cable from the modem for about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in? I want to see if that helps reset the device.

Customer: Sure, yeah. (sounds of unplugging) Alright, it's unplugged. (pause) Should I wait the full thirty seconds?

Agent: Yes, please. Just let it sit there.

Customer: (pause) Okay, counting down... and... (plugging sounds) alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's just give it about a minute to boot back up. While we're waiting, can you tell me if you've experienced any storms or power outages in your area recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been pretty clear all morning. The power in my house is fine, all my other stuff is working.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. (pause) Do you see any lights coming on the modem now?

Customer: (pause) Nothing yet. Should they be on by now?

Agent: They usually take about 60 to 90 seconds to fully power up. Let's give it another few seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, still nothing. This is weird.

Agent: Yeah, that is unusual. Are you looking at the power light specifically?

Customer: Yeah, the power light should be first on the unit, right? That's what I remember.

Agent: Yes, exactly. There should be a power indicator light, usually green or white. If that's not coming on, it might indicate a power delivery issue to the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is the modem broken?

Agent: It could be, but let me have you try one more thing before we determine that. Can you try plugging the modem into a different outlet? Maybe somewhere else in your house? Just to rule out an outlet issue.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, sure. Let me... (sounds of movement) Okay, I'm going to try the outlet in my bedroom.

Agent: Alright.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I've got the modem over here. (sounds of plugging in) Let me plug it in... and... (pause) ...still nothing. No lights.

Agent: Hmm. Still nothing at all?

Customer: Nope. Dead as a doornail.

Agent: (pause) Alright. I'm going to be honest with you—that does suggest there might be an issue with the modem itself. But before we go down that road, let me check something on my end. Give me just one moment. (typing sounds)

Customer: Sure.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at your account here and I'm not seeing any service interruptions reported in your area. The network on our end looks good. No outages showing for your location or the surrounding areas.

Customer: So it's definitely the modem then?

Agent: It's looking that way, but here's what I want to try. I want to check if there's a known issue with the equipment we sent you. Can you tell me what model modem and router you have? It should be listed on the device itself.

Customer: (pause) Let me look... it says... uh... it's a Frontier-branded thing. The model is... NXGN2-2411. Does that mean anything?

Agent: (typing sounds) NXGN2-2411. Okay, let me look that up in our system. (pause) Alright, I'm seeing that model in our database and... no, there are no widespread issues reported with that equipment. So it's probably isolated to your specific unit.

Customer: So what do we do? Can you send me a new one?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. We can definitely do that. However, before I initiate a replacement, let me just try one more troubleshooting step, if you don't mind. Sometimes the issue could be with the power adapter rather than the modem itself. Do you have another compatible power adapter you could try?

Customer: I don't think so, no. I mean, I have chargers and stuff, but I don't have another one for the modem.

Agent: That's okay. Unfortunately, the modem has a proprietary power connector, so you'd need a Frontier-branded adapter. (pause) You know what, I think at this point, the best course of action is to get you a replacement unit. I can have a technician bring that out to you, or we can send it via mail depending on what works best for you.

Customer: How long would either of those take? I really need to be online for work.

Agent: Well, if we send it by mail, you're probably looking at 3 to 5 business days. If you want expedited shipping, that might bump it to 2 to 3 days. Or we could schedule a technician visit, which depending on availability, could be as soon as tomorrow or the day after.

Customer: Tomorrow would be ideal. Can you do that?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) What does your schedule look like tomorrow? Are you available during the day?

Customer: Yeah, I can work from somewhere else if I need to. What time would they come by?

Agent: (pause) I'm pulling up the service calendar here... (pause) Okay, we have a window available tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works. That's perfect.

Agent: Great. Let me just get your contact information confirmed. Your phone number is still 555-0147, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: And is there a best number for the technician to call if they're running a few minutes behind or if they can't locate your address?

Customer: That's the same number.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to get this set up for you. (typing sounds) I've scheduled a technician visit for tomorrow, between 1 and 5 PM. They'll bring out replacement modem and router equipment. Is there anything else I should note about your address? Like, is it easy to find, or...?

Customer: No, it's pretty straightforward. It's on Maple Street, corner lot.

Agent: Alright, I've got that. Now, I want to mention that in the meantime, if you have a mobile hotspot on your phone, that could potentially help you get some work done until the technician arrives tomorrow.

Customer: Oh, yeah, I actually do have that. I could do that if I really need to. I was just hoping to avoid using up my data.

Agent: I totally understand. Well, hopefully the visit tomorrow will get you back online. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. What time should I expect them exactly?

Agent: It'll be within that 1 to 5 PM window tomorrow. They should call you within 30 minutes of arriving in your area to give you a heads up.

Customer: Okay, got it. Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. I really do apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get you back up and running tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
