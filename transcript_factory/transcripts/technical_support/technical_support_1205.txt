Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of, but I can't get it back up and running.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I'm showing an account for... is this Michael at 442 Oakmont Drive?

Customer: Yep, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you noticed any outages in your area, or did it just suddenly stop working?

Customer: No, there's no outage that I know of. I was just working from home, and suddenly the connection just... dropped. Like, one second I'm on a video call and the next second, nothing.

Agent: Okay, and when you say nothing, is there any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, actually. The modem has some lights on it. There's like a blue light and a green light, but they're not... I don't know, they seem kind of dim?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So we've got some power getting to the device, which is good. Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in yet?

Customer: Yeah, I did that already. I unplugged it, waited like thirty seconds, plugged it back in. Same thing happened.

Agent: Alright, and after you did that, did you wait a few minutes for it to fully boot back up?

Customer: Yeah, I gave it like five minutes. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay. And what about your router? Do you have a separate router, or is it all in one unit?

Customer: I have a separate router. It's the Netgear one you guys... or that I have anyway.

Agent: Got it. Is your router powered on as well?

Customer: Yes, it's on. The lights are on it too, but they're also kind of... I mean, they're brighter than the modem, but I'm not sure what they should look like normally.

Agent: That's okay. So what we want to see on the modem is typically a solid green light for internet connectivity. Can you tell me, is that green light solid or is it blinking?

Customer: (pause) It's blinking. It's blinking pretty fast, actually.

Agent: Okay, so a blinking green light usually means the modem is trying to establish a connection but hasn't quite gotten there yet. Let me try a few more things with you. Can you unplug the modem one more time, but this time, let's also unplug your router?

Customer: Sure, hold on. (pause) Okay, unplugging now... (pause) Both are unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's leave them unplugged for about two minutes while we let them fully discharge.

Customer: Okay... (long pause) It's been like a minute already. This is so frustrating. I have a bunch of work I need to get done today.

Agent: I totally understand. I know this is inconvenient. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it in now.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait for about ninety seconds for that to fully boot up, and then we'll plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Okay, I'm counting... alright, it's been about ninety seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it another full minute or two to fully boot up and establish the connection.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, so... I'm looking at the modem and the green light is still blinking. Still doing the same thing.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Still blinking. Can you tell me, are you getting any internet connectivity at all? Can you try opening a web browser or checking your phone if you have it connected to the WiFi?

Customer: (pause) Let me try... (pause) No, nothing. My phone won't connect either. I'm trying to connect to the WiFi network and it's just... it won't go through.

Agent: Okay, so the WiFi network is showing up on your phone, it's just not connecting?

Customer: Right, exactly. It shows up, I put in the password, and it just times out or something.

Agent: Alright. And the WiFi network name—is it showing the normal network name, or is it showing something like "Netgear" with the default name?

Customer: It's... (pause) it says "Netgear-5G," so it seems like it's working, but like I said, I can't actually connect to it.

Agent: Okay, that's actually a sign that the router is powering on but might not be receiving a signal from the modem. Let me try one more thing. Can you check the cable that runs from the modem to the wall outlet—the coaxial cable? Can you just make sure it's firmly connected on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm checking it now... (pause) Okay, it looks pretty tight. But let me unplug it and plug it back in to make sure.

Agent: Good idea.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's unplugged and... plugging it back in now.

Agent: (pause) Okay, any change?

Customer: (pause) No, still the same. Still blinking.

Agent: [inaudible] Alright, I'm going to check our systems real quick to see if there are any issues on our end. One moment, please. (hold music plays for about 30 seconds)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So I'm not seeing any service issues in your area, and your modem is registering on our network, which tells me it's able to communicate with our equipment. But the fact that it's not fully syncing up is... well, it's unusual.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: It could be a modem issue, yes, or it could be something with the connection itself. But I think at this point, we should probably get a technician out to your house to do a more thorough inspection. They can check the line coming in from the street and test the equipment directly.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what our availability looks like... Okay, so I can schedule you for tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM, or we do have some availability on Friday morning between 8 and 12 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow at 12 to 4 would work for me, I guess.

Agent: Perfect. So I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, December 15th, between 12 and 4 PM. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. Is the number we have on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Okay, great. And just to confirm, we're still looking at 442 Oakmont Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you should receive a confirmation email shortly, and the technician will text you when they're about thirty minutes away. In the meantime, I'd recommend keeping your modem and router unplugged just to avoid any potential issues, and we'll get someone out to you tomorrow to get this sorted out.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: Honestly, I'd just leave everything off for now. We don't want to potentially damage anything. The technician will take a look at everything tomorrow and figure out what's going on.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate it. This is still really frustrating because I need my internet to work today, but I guess there's not much we can do.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone. But our technician is really skilled and should be able to resolve this for you quickly tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. We'll see you tomorrow, Michael.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
