Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and plugging it back in, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll definitely get this sorted out for you. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. Thanks for that. So you're saying your internet went down about an hour ago, and you've already tried the basic restart. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I unplugged the modem and the router, waited like a minute or two, and plugged them back in. Still nothing. The lights on the modem aren't even turning on now that I think about it.

Agent: Okay, that's actually helpful information. The lights being off could indicate a power issue. Let me ask you—when you look at the modem right now, is there a power cable connected to it?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... it's plugged into the wall. Wait, hold on. (background noise, sound of movement) Let me check the back of it. Oh, huh. The power cable is a little loose. I'm gonna plug it in tighter.

Agent: Good thinking. Go ahead and do that for me.

Customer: (more background noise) Okay... yeah, I pushed it in. But... the lights still aren't coming on.

Agent: Hmm, alright. Can you try plugging the modem into a different outlet? Sometimes the outlet itself can go bad.

Customer: Sure, I can do that. (pause, more background noise) Okay, I'm moving it over to the outlet by the TV. (pause) Plugging it in now and... no, still nothing. Still dark.

Agent: I see. Alright, Michael, I'm checking our system here to see if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) What's your street address?

Customer: It's 4782 Maple Drive, apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what zip code?

Customer: 97201.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, I'm looking at that now. I don't see any service outages reported in your area. The network on my end appears to be working normally for your location. What I want to do is try a few more troubleshooting steps. Let me walk you through a factory reset on the modem. That sometimes helps with these situations.

Customer: Okay... how do I do that?

Agent: Alright, so on the back of the modem—and this is important—there should be a small recessed button labeled "Reset." You're gonna need something thin like a paperclip or a pen to press it. Do you have something like that handy?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think I have a pen right here. One second. (background noise) Okay, I'm looking at the back. There's a lot of cables and stuff, but I see... yeah, I see a little button that says "Reset."

Agent: Perfect. Alright, so what I want you to do is hold that button down for about 10 to 15 seconds. But first, make sure the modem is plugged in—which it is—and then just hold that button.

Customer: Okay, here we go. (pause, background noise) Holding it... and... (pause) okay, I'm at like 15 seconds. I'm letting go now.

Agent: Good. Now the modem should restart. This might take a couple minutes, so just let it sit for a moment and watch those lights on the front.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm waiting. Um... (longer pause) ...still nothing. The lights aren't turning on.

Agent: Alright, still nothing. That's... okay. That suggests the modem itself might be the issue here. Let me ask you this—have there been any recent storms in your area? Any power surges or anything like that?

Customer: Uh, not that I'm aware of. I mean, we had some rain yesterday, but nothing crazy.

Agent: Okay. And you mentioned the modem was working fine before about an hour ago?

Customer: Yeah, it was working perfectly. I was using it this morning, and then when I got home from work, it was just... dead.

Agent: (pause) I understand. Michael, at this point, based on what we've tried—the restart, the different outlet, the factory reset—and the fact that the modem isn't powering on at all, it does sound like the modem itself may have failed. That can happen sometimes, especially if there was any kind of power fluctuation.

Customer: So what do I do? I need my internet back. I work from home sometimes, and I've got stuff I need to do.

Agent: I completely understand. What we can do is get a replacement modem sent out to you. Typically, our standard modems ship within one to two business days, and we can have a technician come out if needed. However, I do want to try one more thing before we go down that route. Can you check if you have a battery backup or a UPS device anywhere? Something that might be providing power?

Customer: (pause) A battery backup? I... I don't think so. Let me look around. (background noise, pause) No, I don't see anything like that.

Agent: Alright. Let me put you on a very brief hold while I check your service options and what we can get processed for you today.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (hold music plays for about 20 seconds, then agent returns) Okay, Michael, thanks for your patience. I've reviewed your account, and I do want to try something. Do you have a smartphone or a tablet, anything with a USB power adapter?

Customer: Yeah, I have my phone charger. Why?

Agent: Alright, so as a last-ditch effort, I want you to try plugging the modem in using your phone's USB-C charger, just to rule out a power supply issue. It probably won't work because modems need more power than that, but it's worth trying.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm grabbing my charger. (background noise) Alright, I've got it here. Finding the USB port on the modem... okay, plugging it in. (pause) Nothing. Same as before.

Agent: Alright, I had to ask. Michael, I think at this point we're looking at a modem failure. Unfortunately, that's not something we can fix over the phone. What I'm going to do is set up a replacement modem to be shipped to your address. You should receive it within one to two business days.

Customer: And then I can just plug it in and it'll work?

Agent: Exactly. It should arrive pre-configured for your account, so you just unbox it, plug in the power and the coax cable from your wall—that's the cable that looks like a TV antenna cable—and it should connect automatically.

Customer: What about in the meantime? I don't have internet for two days?

Agent: I know that's frustrating. Unfortunately, with a modem failure, there's not much we can do remotely. If you need internet urgently, your options would be to use mobile data or visit a local coffee shop or library with WiFi. I'm really sorry about this situation.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, no, I get it. Can you at least make sure it ships out ASAP?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm flagging this as a priority shipment, so it should go out first thing tomorrow morning. You'll receive a tracking number via email within a few hours. And Michael, I also want to credit your account for the downtime. I'm applying a $15 credit that'll show up on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, well... I appreciate that, I guess. So I should get the modem by... Thursday or Friday then?

Agent: That's right. Most likely Thursday, but possibly Friday depending on your location. You'll know for sure once you get that tracking email.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope, just keep an eye on your email for that tracking number and the modem should arrive ready to go. Once you get it and plug it in, if you have any issues with it, just give us a call back and we'll help you out.

Customer: Okay, will do. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. We really do apologize for the inconvenience. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we'll have you back up and running real soon.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day. Bye now.
