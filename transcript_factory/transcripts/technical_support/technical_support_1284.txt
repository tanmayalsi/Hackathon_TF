Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I've tried restarting the modem a couple times but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I see your account here. So you mentioned the internet's been down since this morning? Have there been any recent weather or power outages in your area?

Customer: No, no, the power's been fine. I mean, everything else is working. It's just the internet that went out. I don't understand why it would just stop working like that.

Agent: Right, I understand your frustration. Let me ask you a few questions. When you look at your modem and router, are there any lights on them at all?

Customer: Um, yeah, so the modem has some lights on it. Let me see... there's a green light on the front and... yeah, I think there's an orange or red light blinking?

Agent: Okay, so you have power to the modem. That's good. The red or orange blinking light typically indicates there might be a connection issue. Can you tell me which light exactly is blinking? Is it near a label?

Customer: (pause) It's kind of hard to tell from where I'm sitting. Hold on, let me move closer. (background noise) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. There's one that says "Internet" and it's red.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. That's actually really helpful. The Internet light being red means the modem isn't detecting a signal from our network. Let's try a few things. First, can you locate where your cables connect to the modem? There should be a coaxial cable coming in from the wall.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's plugged in.

Agent: Great. Can you try unplugging that cable from the modem, wait about ten seconds, and then plug it back in?

Customer: Sure, one second. (background noise, pause) Okay, I unplugged it... and now I'm plugging it back in.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait a moment and see if that Internet light changes. What are you seeing now?

Customer: Uh... (pause) ...still red. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Okay, no worries. Sometimes it takes a bit longer. Let me try something else. Can you do a hard reset on the modem? What I want you to do is hold down the reset button for about fifteen seconds. There should be a small button, maybe recessed, usually on the back of the modem.

Customer: Oh, I see it. I'm holding it now. (pause) Okay, how long do you want me to hold it?

Agent: About fifteen seconds. It might feel like a long time, but just count it out or watch for the lights to go out and come back on.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm counting... fifteen seconds. (pause) The lights went off and now they're coming back on.

Agent: Excellent. Now let's watch those lights for a moment. (pause) What are you seeing on the Internet light now?

Customer: (pause) It's... still red. It's still blinking red.

Agent: Hmm, okay. (pause) Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at our network here and I'm actually not showing your modem connecting to our network at all, which is consistent with what we're seeing on the device itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is there like a service outage or something?

Agent: It's possible, but let me rule out a few more things first. Can you check the physical connection where the cable comes into your house? It might be where your cable enters the wall from outside. Is there a cable box or connection point there?

Customer: I... I'm not really sure where that would be. I don't want to mess with anything outside.

Agent: I totally understand. Let me see if I can help from here. Actually, let me put you on a brief hold while I check if there are any outages reported in your area code. It should just be a moment.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (hold music, typing sounds) Thank you for holding. I've checked and there don't appear to be any reported outages on our end right now. However, I do want to try one more thing before we potentially escalate this. Let me make sure your modem is on the latest firmware. Can you tell me what model modem you have? It should be written on a sticker on top.

Customer: (pause) It says... it's a Frontier... uh... looks like a GigaHub or something?

Agent: Okay, a GigaHub model. That's fairly recent. And just to confirm, you've tried restarting it, unplugging the cable, and doing a hard reset. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, I've done all that. And still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I want to be honest with you. Given that the modem isn't connecting to our network at all and we're not seeing any outages, this could be a couple of things. It could be an issue with the connection coming into your house, or there could be an issue with the modem itself that we'd need to investigate further or possibly replace.

Customer: So what do I do? I need my internet working. I have work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I completely understand. I think at this point, we should schedule a technician to come out and check both the line coming into your house and the modem itself. They'll be able to diagnose it properly. How does that sound?

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. We have some open slots this week. It looks like we could get someone out to you... we have Thursday afternoon or Friday morning available. Which works better for you?

Customer: Friday morning would be better. I could take some time off work for that.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get you scheduled for Friday morning. We'll send a technician between 8 AM and 12 PM. Can you confirm the address on your account is still... (reading) ...124 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Wonderful. So to recap, we've done some troubleshooting, the issue appears to be with the line connection coming into your home or the modem itself, and we have a technician scheduled for Friday morning between 8 and 12. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all those details.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything I should try in the meantime?

Agent: You can try leaving it powered off for a couple hours and then powering it back on, but honestly, based on what we've tried, I don't expect that to resolve it. The technician will take it from here.

Customer: Alright, I guess that's all I can do. Thanks for trying.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved over the phone today. We really appreciate your patience, and that technician will get you back online as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
