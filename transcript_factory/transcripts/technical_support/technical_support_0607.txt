Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I have no idea what's going on. I've got work stuff I need to do and it's really frustrating.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how inconvenient that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Thanks for that. So you're saying your internet went out about an hour ago? Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually that's a good question. Let me look. (pause) Okay, so I see... the modem has a red light on it. Like, it's just solid red. And the router is... I don't know, it's not doing anything. Both devices are plugged in though.

Agent: Alright, a solid red light on the modem typically indicates there's a connection issue. That's helpful. What I'd like to do is have you power cycle both devices. So just unplug your modem first, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Unplugged. I'm just gonna... count to thirty here. (pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Now while that's booting back up, let's do the same with your router. Go ahead and unplug that one as well.

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. Should I wait the same amount of time?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Thirty seconds should do it.

Customer: (pause) Okay... plugging it back in now. So, um, how long does this usually take? Like, for it to come back online?

Agent: It should take about two to three minutes typically. The modem will boot first, and then the router. You'll see the lights change—they'll probably blink for a bit, and then you should see a solid blue or green light on the modem once it's connected.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Um, so far I'm seeing... still some red. And the router's got like, white lights blinking on it.

Agent: That's normal. That's the boot-up process. Give it another minute or so. Sometimes it takes a little longer than expected.

Customer: (pause) Alright... still the same. (pause) Okay, now I'm seeing... it looks like the modem's got a blue light now? Yeah, blue light.

Agent: Excellent! That's what we want to see. And do you have internet access now? Can you try opening a web browser and seeing if you can load a website?

Customer: (pause) Let me grab my laptop. (pause) Okay, I'm opening... let me try Google. (pause) Nope. Still nothing. The page isn't loading.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check on our end to see if there are any service issues in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages in your service area at the moment. That's interesting. Let me ask you a few more questions. Are you connected to your WiFi network on your laptop?

Customer: Oh, good question. Let me check. (pause) Yeah, I am. It says I'm connected to my network.

Agent: Okay, you're connected to the network, but you're not able to access the internet through it. That's... that's something we can work with. Let me have you try a wired connection. Do you have an ethernet cable handy?

Customer: Um, yeah, I think I have one somewhere. Let me look. (pause) Okay, I found one. Do you want me to connect directly to the modem?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Plug one end into the modem and the other end into your laptop.

Customer: (pause) Alright, doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's plugged in. Let me try loading that website again. (pause) Still... nothing. Same thing. It's still not loading.

Agent: Alright. And the blue light on the modem is still on?

Customer: Yeah, it's still blue.

Agent: Okay, that's unusual. Let me check the modem model number. Can you tell me what's written on the modem? It should be on a label on the device.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it says... "Frontier Gateway G2410." Is that what you need?

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up the specs on that. That's a solid modem. Um, let me have you try one more thing. Can you restart your modem one more time? And when you do, I want you to hold the power button for about 10 seconds, don't just unplug it.

Customer: Okay, hold the power button for ten seconds. (pause) Doing it now. (pause) Alright, it's off. (pause) I'm plugging it back in... now.

Agent: Good. While that's starting up again, I'm gonna check your account here to see if there's anything on the backend. (typing sounds) (pause) [inaudible] ... interesting.

Customer: What? What do you see?

Agent: Well, I'm seeing that your modem is registered to the network and it has a connection status of... online. So from the system's perspective, everything looks good. But clearly something's not working on your end.

Customer: Yeah, that's super frustrating. Like, it looks like it's connected but I can't actually use it.

Agent: I understand. That is frustrating. (pause) Okay, is the modem fully booted back up now? You should see the lights stabilized.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the blue light is back on. And I can see the internet light is... is on too, actually. I didn't really look at all the lights before.

Agent: Okay, so you have the blue light and the internet light on. Let me try a different approach. I'm going to remotely reset your modem to factory settings. This will take a minute or two. I'm going to need you to hold on the line while I do this.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Is that gonna... will I lose anything? Like, will I have to reconfigure everything?

Agent: You may need to reconnect to your WiFi network, but that's about it. It shouldn't cause any lasting issues. Let me get started here. (pause) (typing sounds) (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, it looks like the reset is processing. Your modem lights are probably going to flicker.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm seeing lights flickering now.

Agent: Perfect. That's what should happen. (pause) (pause) Okay, give it about two more minutes to fully restart with the new settings.

Customer: (pause) [inaudible] still waiting... (pause) Okay, the lights are back to normal. Blue light's on again.

Agent: Alright, now try loading a website again.

Customer: (pause) I'm trying... (pause) Nope. Still not working. It's still saying the page can't be reached. This is... this is really not working.

Agent: Yeah, I hear you. That's... that's frustrating. Let me think about this for a second. (pause) You know what, I think at this point we might be looking at a hardware issue with the modem itself, or potentially a line issue on the outside. I don't want to keep cycling through troubleshooting steps if the issue is on our end.

Customer: Okay, so what does that mean?

Agent: What I'd like to do is get a technician out to your place. They can check the line coming into your house and test your modem directly. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Um, yeah, I guess. How long is that gonna take? Like, when can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability. (pause) I can get someone out to you tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have an opening on Thursday afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works. I need to get this fixed.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get some information from you. Is the phone number we have on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, 555-0147, that's my cell.

Agent: Great, and just to confirm your address... (typing sounds) I'm showing 847 Maple Street, Apartment 3B?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So we have a technician scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. They'll give you a call about 30 minutes before they arrive. Your reference number is 4829156. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I mean, hopefully the tech can figure out what's wrong. This is just really inconvenient timing for me.

Agent: I completely understand. I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get this resolved for you tomorrow. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, David. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
