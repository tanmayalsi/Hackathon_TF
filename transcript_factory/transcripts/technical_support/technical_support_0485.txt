Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got a meeting in like twenty minutes and I really need to get this working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here. And what's your name?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Thanks for that. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you tried restarting your modem and router yet?

Customer: Yeah, I unplugged everything like an hour ago and let it sit for a minute. Plugged it back in but nothing. Still no internet.

Agent: Alright, well let's see what we can do here. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Are you getting any lights on the modem at the moment?

Customer: Uh, yeah. There's a red light on the front. It's just... it's red. Normally it's green or whatever, right?

Agent: (pause) Okay, so the red light indicates a connection issue. That's helpful. Can you check the back of your modem for me? I want to make sure all the cables are plugged in securely.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, hold on. (rustling sounds) Okay so I've got the power cable, that's in. There's another cable that goes into the wall... I think that's the fiber line?

Agent: Yes, exactly. That would be your fiber connection. Can you unplug that one and plug it back in? Sometimes those connections can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging now... and back in. (pause) Hmm, still red.

Agent: Alright, let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) It looks like your account shows an active service. Do you happen to know if there's any construction or maintenance happening in your area? Sometimes that can affect service temporarily.

Customer: Oh, um... I'm not sure. There might be? I saw some trucks down the street yesterday, but I don't know if they were Frontier or someone else.

Agent: That could be it. Let me run a line test real quick to see if we're detecting any signal on our end. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm actually not seeing a strong signal coming back from your modem. That's concerning.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it broken or something?

Agent: It could be a few things. It might be an issue with the modem itself, or there could be a problem with the line coming into your house. Let me try one more thing. Can you restart the modem one more time, but this time I want you to unplug it for about five minutes? That'll do a complete reset.

Customer: Five minutes? Okay... (pause) Do I need to do anything else while I'm waiting?

Agent: Just leave it unplugged. I'll be right here. I can put you on a brief hold if you'd like, or you can just wait on the line?

Customer: I'll just wait. I don't really want to be on hold if I don't have to be. (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) I get that. So while we're waiting, let me ask you a few more questions. Have you experienced any outages in your area recently that you're aware of?

Customer: Not that I know of. My neighbor seems to have internet. I see their Wi-Fi network showing up, so... I don't know.

Agent: That's good to know actually. So it seems like it might be specific to your line. Okay, it should be about five minutes. Go ahead and plug the modem back in now if you're ready.

Customer: Alright, plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, it's starting back up. The lights are... still doing their thing. Powering on. (pause) Uh, it's still red.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay, let me see here. I'm not seeing any change on the line test. Unfortunately, David, what this is pointing to is likely a physical issue with the fiber line coming into your home, or a problem with the modem that would require replacement.

Customer: So you're saying you can't fix this over the phone?

Agent: I wish I could. In cases like this, we typically need to send a technician out to your location to diagnose and repair the issue. We'd need to do a truck roll to check the line integrity and see if there's any damage or if your modem needs to be replaced.

Customer: (sighs) How long would that take? Like I said, I have work I need to get done.

Agent: I understand. Let me check our availability for you. (typing sounds) (pause) So I'm looking at our technician schedule for your area. The earliest we have available is tomorrow morning between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean... I guess it has to. Is there any way to get someone sooner? Like this afternoon?

Agent: Let me see what I can do. (pause) Unfortunately, our technicians are fully booked for the rest of today. I'm sorry about that. But I can definitely note this as urgent on your work order, and if we have any cancellations, I can reach out to you. What's the best number to contact you at?

Customer: That's this number, 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. So to confirm, we have a technician appointment for tomorrow, 8 a.m. to 12 p.m., and I'll make sure we have your contact information flagged as urgent in case there's any opening today. You should receive a confirmation email shortly as well.

Customer: Okay. Well, I guess I'll figure out something for today. Can I use my phone's hotspot or something?

Agent: Absolutely. That's probably your best bet for today. You can use your cellular data to tether to your computer, though of course that'll use up your mobile data, so just keep that in mind.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I'll do that. So I'll see a technician tomorrow then?

Agent: That's correct. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I appreciate your patience, David. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone. Our technician will get you sorted out tomorrow. Is there anything else?

Customer: Nope, that's all.

Agent: Alright, have a good rest of your day, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
