# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll get this sorted out for you. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing an account for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Can you tell me a little bit about what's happening right now? Like, do you have any lights on your router at all?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) Yeah, so I've got a router right here. The power light is on, but... I don't think the internet light is on. It's usually blue and it's not lit up at all.

Agent: Okay, okay. That's helpful. So the power is on but we're not seeing that internet connection light. Have you tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in yet?

Customer: No, I haven't done that. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, that's actually a good first step. Go ahead and unplug it from the power outlet for me, and let's wait about thirty seconds before we plug it back in. That'll do a full reboot.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, it's unplugged. I'm just gonna... count down here... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. And while that's coming back up, let me just ask—have there been any storms in your area recently, or any construction work going on near your home?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine last night when I went to bed. This is just... it's really frustrating because I have a work meeting at two o'clock and I need to be online for that.

Agent: I totally understand. Let's see if we can get you up and running before then. (pause) What are you seeing now on the router?

Customer: Okay, um, the power light is back on. And... I'm waiting for the other lights... there we go, I see some lights coming on now. The internet light is... it's blinking orange. Does that mean something?

Agent: Okay, so an orange blinking light typically means it's trying to establish a connection. That's actually a step in the right direction. Let's give it another minute or so to fully connect.

Customer: Alright. (long pause) It's still blinking. How long should this usually take?

Agent: It shouldn't take more than a couple minutes. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm not showing a connection from your modem right now. Have you noticed any loose cables at all? Like, is the coax cable—that's the cable coming in from outside—is that plugged in securely?

Customer: Oh, good question. (rustling) Let me check behind the... yeah, I mean it looks pretty connected to me. It's pretty tight.

Agent: Can you try wiggling it a little bit and just making sure it's seated all the way in?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm doing that now... okay, it's in there pretty good.

Agent: And on the modem side, do you see the same cable plugged into the back of the modem?

Customer: Yeah, it's... it looks good. Wait, actually... (pause) Um, I'm seeing the internet light is now... it's solid blue! That's good, right?

Agent: That's excellent! That's exactly what we want to see. Now let me just verify that you've got internet on a device. Can you grab your phone or a laptop and try connecting to it real quick?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, I'm on my laptop now. Um... it's saying no internet connection. That's... that's weird.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me think about this. Are you seeing your Wi-Fi network available?

Customer: Oh wait, let me... (pause) I see it, yeah. I see "Frontier-5G" in my list. Let me click on that.

Agent: Perfect.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm connecting... it's asking for a password. Um, I think I remember it... (typing sounds) (long pause) Okay, it says connected, but it's still saying no internet access.

Agent: I see. That's unusual. Let me... can you try opening a web browser real quick and just typing in a URL? Like, try Google dot com or something.

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (pause) [inaudible] ...just loading, loading... nothing's happening. The page won't load.

Agent: Alright. (typing sounds) Let me check on our network status. I'm going to put you on a very brief hold while I look into what's happening on our side. It'll just be about a minute. Hold tight for me.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (hold music, approximately 45 seconds) Thanks for waiting, Robert. Okay, so I'm not showing any service interruptions in your area, which is good news. But I am not seeing an active connection from your modem to our network. Let me try a few more things.

Customer: Alright.

Agent: Can you unplug the modem—not the router, but the modem itself—for about thirty seconds?

Customer: The modem? Which one is that?

Agent: Right, so the modem should be separate from the router. It's usually a smaller box. Is there a box with more lights on it than the other one?

Customer: Oh, okay, I see it now. There's like a white box. Is that it?

Agent: That could be it, yeah. Does it have "Frontier" written on it or a brand name?

Customer: Yeah, it says Frontier on it.

Agent: Perfect, that's your modem. Go ahead and unplug that one from power.

Customer: (rustling) Okay, unplugged.

Agent: And we'll give it thirty seconds again... (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug that back in.

Customer: (plug sounds) Okay, it's back in. (pause) The lights are starting up again.

Agent: Great. Give it about a minute to fully boot up and connect.

Customer: (long pause, approximately 60 seconds) Okay, it's been a minute. The lights are on again. Same thing—the internet light is blue.

Agent: Good. Now try your laptop again. Do you have internet?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. The page still won't load. This is... I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I hear you. Okay, let me just... (typing sounds) I'm going to try to run a diagnostic on the modem from my end here. (pause) Hmm. Robert, I'm getting a signal, but something is preventing it from reaching your devices. This could be a few different things. 

Customer: Like what?

Agent: Well, it could be an issue with the modem itself, or it could be something with how your devices are connecting. Um, can you try unplugging the router and the modem again, and this time, let's start completely fresh? Leave them unplugged for a full minute.

Customer: I did that already though...

Agent: I know, I know, but we're going to try something different this time. After you plug them back in, I want you to wait for the modem to fully boot—that usually takes about three minutes—and then restart the router after that.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, I'll try it. Hold on... (rustling, pause, long pause of approximately 120 seconds) Okay, they're back on. I'm waiting...

Agent: (typing sounds) Take your time.

Customer: (pause, approximately 90 seconds) Alright, everything looks the same as before. Blue light on the modem. Let me try the laptop... (pause) Nope. Still no internet.

Agent: (pause) Okay, Robert, I've tried several troubleshooting steps with you and we're still not getting a connection to your devices. At this point, I think we might be looking at either a modem issue or possibly something on the line that needs to be checked out physically.

Customer: So what does that mean? What do I do?

Agent: Well, I'd like to get a technician out to your place to take a look. They can check the lines coming into your home and potentially swap out the modem if that's the issue.

Customer: And how long would that take? I have that meeting at two...

Agent: I understand. Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to get someone out there before then. But let me see what we have available for tomorrow. (typing sounds) I'm showing we have a technician available tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, I guess. That's not ideal, but okay.

Agent: I really apologize, Robert. I know this is frustrating. I'm going to get you scheduled for tomorrow, and I'll also put a note on your account that we attempted multiple troubleshooting steps. The technician will see that when they arrive.

Customer: Is there anything else I can try in the meantime? Like, anything at all?

Agent: Um, you could try connecting directly to the modem with an ethernet cable instead of using Wi-Fi, just to rule out a Wi-Fi issue. Do you have an ethernet cable?

Customer: I, uh... I might have one somewhere. Let me... (pause) Yeah, I think I've got one. What do I do with it?

Agent: Plug one end into the back of the modem and one end into your laptop. Then try accessing the internet with that.

Customer: (pause, rustling, approximately 30 seconds) Okay, I've got it plugged in. (pause) Let me try to open a page... (pause) No, still nothing.

Agent: Okay, that confirms it's not a Wi-Fi issue. It's definitely something with the modem or the line. The technician tomorrow should be able to figure it out.

Customer: Alright. Thank you, I guess. So I'm scheduled for tomorrow between 1 and 5?

Agent: That's correct. You should get a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details. And if you need to reschedule for any reason, you can call back or just use that email link. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying.

Agent: You're welcome, Robert. Again, I apologize we couldn't get this fixed remotely today. We'll definitely have you back up and running tomorrow. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
