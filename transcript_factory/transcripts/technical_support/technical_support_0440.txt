# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got work calls scheduled in like twenty minutes, so I'm kind of freaking out here.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And your name?

Customer: It's Michael. Michael Springer.

Agent: Great, Michael. I've got you here. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Just to confirm, you're getting no connection at all, correct? Like, your devices aren't connecting to the WiFi?

Customer: Right, exactly. Nothing. I tried restarting my router like three times. I unplugged it, waited, plugged it back in... nothing. My phone won't even recognize the WiFi network anymore.

Agent: Okay, I appreciate you trying that already. That's actually a good first step. Let me pull up your account details here. (pause) (typing sounds) So you're on our Fiber 200 plan. Is your modem powered on right now? Can you check for me?

Customer: Yeah, let me look. Um... (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it now. The power light is on but... huh. The internet light, like, the globe symbol or whatever, it's not lit up. Everything else looks normal though.

Agent: Ah, okay. That's actually really helpful information. That globe light indicates your connection to our network. When that's off, it means there's no signal coming in from our line. Let me check if there are any service issues on your end. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any major outages in your area, but let me ask you this—have you had any recent storms or construction work near your home?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been fine all week. This is just... out of nowhere.

Agent: Understood. So what I'd like to do is walk you through a few steps to try to reset your equipment. First, I need you to locate the power cable going into your modem. Do you see it?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's the white cable, right?

Agent: That's the one. Now I'm going to have you unplug it completely and then unplug your router as well if they're separate devices. Are they in separate boxes or is it all one unit?

Customer: They're separate. Okay, I'm unplugging the modem now. (pause) And the router. Everything's off.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's leave them unplugged for about two full minutes. I know it seems like a long time, but this allows the equipment to fully power down and reset. While we wait, let me just check a few things on the back end here. (typing sounds) (pause) Are you still there, Michael?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here. Just waiting. Should I... are you guys getting like any signal from my equipment?

Agent: That's a good question. From what I'm seeing, it looks like your modem was trying to connect to the network, but then it dropped off around 6:47 this morning. After that, nothing. That would match up with when you noticed it went down?

Customer: Oh wow, yeah, that's... that's almost exactly when I tried to join a Teams meeting. I remember looking at the time.

Agent: Okay, so that tracks. All right, it should be about two minutes now. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first, and then we'll do the router in about thirty seconds after that.

Customer: (sounds of rustling, then a click) Okay, modem's back in. (pause) And... okay, thirty seconds... (pause) Okay, router's plugged back in now.

Agent: Good. Now these are going to take a minute or so to boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me if you see any lights starting to come on?

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, the power light just came on the modem. And I'm seeing... orange lights now? Is that normal?

Agent: Orange is... okay, that means it's still initializing. That should turn green or blue once it fully boots. Give it another minute or so.

Customer: (pause) Okay. It's been like... thirty seconds since I plugged it in. Still orange.

Agent: That should be fine. It can take up to a minute and a half for that to fully light up. What about your router? Are you seeing any lights on it?

Customer: Yeah, the power light's on the router, and I'm getting like a blue light now, but nothing on the internet symbol on the modem yet.

Agent: (pause) Okay. And you've waited... (typing sounds) about forty-five seconds now, so we're getting close. Michael, while we wait, have you had any technician visits recently? Any work done on your line outside?

Customer: No, I don't think so. Not that I'm aware of anyway. (pause) Okay, um... it's been like a minute now. The modem still just has the orange light on the internet symbol. Like, it's not green.

Agent: Okay, let's give it one more minute. Sometimes these take a bit longer to sync back up after a reset.

Customer: (pause) (background noise - tapping) Still orange. This is taking forever.

Agent: I know, it's frustrating. Let me check something on my end again. (typing sounds) (longer pause) Okay, so I'm not detecting your modem trying to reconnect to our network, which is unusual. Michael, I'm going to need to try something else here. Can you tell me what model modem you have? It should say on the front or back of the device.

Customer: Um... (pause) It says... "Frontier Quantum Gateway" something. Q-G-5-5-0-0, I think?

Agent: Perfect, thank you. And the router?

Customer: It's like an Asus? An older one. ROG something.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to try an remote reboot of your modem from here. This might take a moment. Just keep an eye on it and let me know if anything changes.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Is that... are you doing it now?

Agent: Yes, actually. Let me know if you see anything different on the modem.

Customer: (pause) (pause) Still looks the same. Still the orange light. Should there be like a power flicker or something?

Agent: (pause) There should be, actually. Hmm. (typing sounds) It looks like the remote reboot didn't take. That suggests the modem itself might not be able to communicate with our network. Michael, I'm going to be honest with you—this is pointing to either an issue with your line coming into the house or possibly a hardware failure on the modem itself.

Customer: (pause) Oh man. So like... what does that mean?

Agent: Well, ideally I'd like to get a technician out to check your exterior line and test your modem. But given your work schedule today, I wanted to check if you have any other options. Do you happen to have a mobile hotspot you could use for your meeting?

Customer: Um, my phone's got unlimited data, so I could probably use that. But like, that's not really a permanent solution, right? When can you get someone out here?

Agent: You're absolutely right. Let me check our tech availability. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest we have is... it looks like tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Really? Can't anyone come out today? I mean, if my internet's completely down...

Agent: I understand how frustrating that is, Michael. Unfortunately, our technicians are fully booked for today, and given that it's already past 9 AM, we wouldn't be able to get anyone out in time anyway. (pause) I'm sorry about that. Tomorrow is the soonest slot we have available.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, yeah, I guess tomorrow works. But like, is there anything else we can try right now? Any other troubleshooting or something?

Agent: (pause) We can try one more thing, which is to check if your service is actually active. Sometimes there can be account issues. Can you try connecting a device directly to the modem with an ethernet cable? Just to see if you get any connection that way, WiFi or not?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Uh, sure. I've got an ethernet cable somewhere. (pause) (pause) Okay, found one. Let me plug my laptop in directly.

Agent: Perfect.

Customer: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, it's connected. And I'm... (pause) no. Still nothing. The laptop's not detecting any network connection. This is... yeah, this isn't looking good.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, unfortunately that confirms what we're seeing on my end. The modem isn't receiving signal from our network at all. It's definitely going to need a technician visit. But I do want to make sure you're set up for tomorrow. Let me schedule that for you now. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to send a tech out tomorrow, and I've got you down for between 1 and 5 PM. Can you make sure someone's home during that window?

Customer: Yeah, I'll make sure I'm here. But do I need to do anything? Like, should I try to restart anything else, or...?

Agent: No, I'd actually recommend just leaving everything as is. If something changes before the tech arrives—like if it suddenly starts working—give us a call back. But otherwise, just leave it powered on and we'll get it sorted out tomorrow.

Customer: Okay. (pause) And if it turns out to be like a hardware issue, is that going to cost me to replace the modem?

Agent: Good question. If the modem is determined to be defective, we'll replace it at no charge since you're renting it from us. If it turns out to be a line issue, there's no charge for that either. You just pay your regular service fee.

Customer: Okay, that's good to know. Well, I guess that's about all we can do right now then.

Agent: (pause) I really am sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone, Michael. I know that's frustrating. But tomorrow's tech should be able to get you up and running. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I've got the appointment tomorrow, I'll use my phone for my meeting... I just hope this gets fixed fast.

Agent: I understand. We'll make it a priority. Is the number on your account the best way to reach you if the tech needs to contact you tomorrow?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. Same number should be good.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for calling Frontier, Michael. And again, I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this today. Have a good one.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
