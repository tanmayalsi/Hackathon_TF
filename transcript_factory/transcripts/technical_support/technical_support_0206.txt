Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I can't get it back up. I've got work calls scheduled in like an hour and I'm kind of freaking out here.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that is. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got you here. I'm seeing your account for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Alright Robert, I'm looking at your service and I do show that you're on our fiber plan. Let me ask you a few quick questions. First off, when you say your internet's down, are you not getting any lights on your modem at all?

Customer: Um, well, the modem's got some lights on it. Let me look... there's like a green light and then a red light that's blinking.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing a red blinking light. That's actually helpful information. Do you happen to know which light that is? Is it on the left side, right side...?

Customer: It's... I think it's like in the middle? Or maybe the right? I'm not super technical with this stuff, honestly.

Agent: (pause) No worries, that's totally fine. What I'm gonna do is walk you through a quick reset. This fixes things about seventy percent of the time. Can you locate your modem for me right now?

Customer: Yeah, it's right here in my office. It's that box thing, right? With all the cables?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Okay, so what we're gonna do is unplug it from the power source. Just pull that power cable out of the back.

Customer: (pause) Okay... yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds while it fully powers down. I'm gonna need you to count it out or just... wait a bit. I'll wait here with you.

Customer: Alright... (pause) ...okay, I think that's about thirty seconds.

Agent: Great. Now go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in now... (pause) ...okay, it's back in.

Agent: Excellent. Now this is gonna take a minute or two to boot back up. You should see the lights start to cycle through different colors. What you want to see eventually is a solid green light. While we wait, let me ask you—have you had any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, I mean... I've had internet for like three years with you guys and this is the first time. Everything was fine when I went to bed last night.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. (pause) So what are you seeing on the modem now? Any changes?

Customer: Um... yeah, some of the lights are changing. There's some blinking and... okay, now I'm seeing green and red again. The red one's still blinking.

Agent: (pause) The red one's still blinking, hmm. Okay, Robert, can you describe the modem to me? Like, what do you see written on it? Is it a Frontier-branded box?

Customer: Yeah, it says... Frontier. And I think it says... (pause) ...it's kind of hard to read in this lighting, but I think it might say like, "model" something? I can't quite make it out.

Agent: (typing sounds) That's alright. Do you see any label or sticker on top or the back that has numbers on it?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's definitely some numbers and stuff. There's like a barcode situation and some text.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. Let me try a different approach here. Is your computer or phone able to see any WiFi networks available?

Customer: Oh! Let me check. (pause) I'm looking at my phone... yeah, I can see the Frontier network. I can see it in the list.

Agent: Okay, good! That's actually a positive sign. Can you try connecting to it?

Customer: Uh, yeah, trying now... (pause) ...hmm, it's asking for a password.

Agent: Right, do you remember your WiFi password?

Customer: I mean, I probably wrote it down somewhere... (background noise, shuffling) ...hold on, let me find it. (pause) Okay, I think I got it. (typing sounds) ...entering it now. (pause) Nope, it says "incorrect password" or something.

Agent: Hmm, alright. Try it one more time just to make sure—sometimes it's case-sensitive, so capitals and lowercase matter.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, same thing. It's not working.

Agent: (pause) Okay, Robert, let me try resetting your network settings. I'm gonna walk you through this. What I need you to do is look on the back of the modem—there should be a small button, usually recessed in a little hole. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think so. There's like a tiny button?

Agent: That's the one. I'm gonna need you to use a straightened paperclip or a ballpoint pen tip to press and hold that button for about ten to fifteen seconds. This is gonna reset your WiFi settings, so fair warning, this might take a couple minutes to come back online.

Customer: Okay, so I press it and hold it... (pause) ...and how long did you say? Ten seconds?

Agent: Ten to fifteen, so just hold it for about that long. You ready?

Customer: Yeah, doing it now. (pause) I've got the pen pressed in... (pause) ...just holding it... (pause) ...okay, I think that's probably fifteen seconds.

Agent: Good. Now let go and let it reboot again. You should see the lights doing their thing all over.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's like... cycling through all the lights now. Red, green, red, green... is that normal?

Agent: Yeah, that's actually what we want to see. Let it do that for a minute or so while it initializes. While we're waiting here, you mentioned you've got work calls in an hour. What kind of connection speed are you typically getting?

Customer: I mean, it's usually pretty fast. I don't really check the speeds, but I can watch videos and stuff without it buffering, so...

Agent: That's good. Okay, what are you seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Um... the green light is solid now. But the red one is still blinking. Is that... is that supposed to be doing that?

Agent: (pause) The red one should really be off or solid. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) Robert, I'm gonna need to check a few more things. Have you noticed any storms or weather issues in the last day or so?

Customer: No, it's been pretty nice actually.

Agent: Okay. And just to confirm—you haven't made any changes to your setup? No new devices, no one messing with the cables?

Customer: No, everything's the same as it's always been.

Agent: (pause) Alright, here's what I'm thinking. That red light typically indicates either a connectivity issue with our network on our end, or there might be a problem with the device itself. Let me try one more thing. Can you check that all the cables going into the modem are firmly connected? Sometimes they can get jostled loose.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking... yeah, they all look pretty tight. There's like the power cable and then the other one that comes from the wall. Both look good to me.

Agent: Okay. And you don't have any other equipment between the wall outlet and the modem? Like a splitter or anything?

Customer: Uh, no. Just comes straight from the wall to the modem.

Agent: (pause) Alright. (pause) Robert, I'm looking at the diagnostics on your account here, and I'm seeing an issue with the connection to the node. Unfortunately, this is something that's happening on our infrastructure side, not with your equipment or setup. 

Customer: Oh... so like, it's not something I did?

Agent: No, no, you're all clear on your end. The modem's functioning, your WiFi is broadcasting—it's just not able to establish that connection to our network. I'm gonna need to escalate this to our technical operations team. They'll need to send a technician out, or they might be able to resolve it remotely. 

Customer: Okay... so when could someone come out? I really need this working today. I've got those calls this afternoon.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest I'm seeing in the system for a tech visit is tomorrow morning between 8 and 12. However, let me submit a ticket as high priority, and I'll also flag this as a potential infrastructure issue. That might get it resolved faster.

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... (pause) ...is there any way to make it today? I really can't be without internet for work.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, I don't have the ability to schedule same-day appointments from my desk, but what I can do is get you on the phone with our technical operations team right now. They have more access to emergency slots. Would you be okay with that? You might be on hold for a few minutes.

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Whatever it takes.

Agent: Perfect. I'm gonna stay on the line and transfer you over. But before I do, let me just make sure I have your best callback number in case you get disconnected.

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as what I gave you.

Agent: Got it. Okay, Robert, transferring you now. Thanks for your patience, and hopefully we can get this resolved for you.

Customer: Alright, thanks Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Stay on the line.
