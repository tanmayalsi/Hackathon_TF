# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So I woke up this morning and my internet just... it's completely down. I've got nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Uh, yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up here... Got it, thank you. And your name is Michael, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great, Michael. So you're saying you have no internet connection at all right now?

Customer: Nothing. The modem's still lit up, like, I can see lights on it, but there's just no internet. My phone's been trying to connect all morning and nothing.

Agent: Okay, good info. The lights on the modem are helpful. So just to start with the basics here—can you tell me what color the lights are? Are they green, red, orange?

Customer: Um... (pause) there's like a green one, and then there's a red one that's blinking.

Agent: Okay, so we've got a green light and a blinking red light. That red blinking light is typically an indicator that something's not quite right with the connection. Let me just ask—have you tried unplugging the modem yet and plugging it back in?

Customer: No, I haven't actually. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, let's try that first. It's a pretty simple troubleshooting step, but it resolves things more often than you'd think. Go ahead and unplug it, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now... (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. I'm gonna count to thirty... (pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and let it boot back up. That usually takes about a minute or two. While we're waiting, are you on WiFi or ethernet?

Customer: WiFi. I'm on my laptop right now.

Agent: Okay, got it. So once it boots up, try connecting to your WiFi network and see if we get a connection. Let me know what happens.

Customer: (pause) Okay... it's powered back up. The lights are... they're still the same. Green and red blinking.

Agent: Alright, still the same. Let me try a couple other things. Can you check something for me? On your modem, there should be a small reset button. It's usually recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something to press it.

Customer: A reset button? Yeah, I see it. It's like, really tiny.

Agent: That's the one. But before we do a reset—that'll clear everything, so I want to make sure we've got other options first. Let me check your account here and see if there have been any service disruptions in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm not seeing any reported outages on your line. Your service should be active.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It could be an issue with the modem itself, or it could be something with the line coming into your house. Let me try one more thing before we reset everything. Do you have another device you could try? Like a phone or a tablet? Just so we can see if it's a WiFi issue or a broader internet issue.

Customer: Yeah, I've got my phone. Let me try connecting it to the WiFi... (pause) Nothing. My phone's not finding the network at all now.

Agent: Okay, so it's not finding the network. That's interesting. The WiFi network should be broadcasting from that modem. This might indicate the modem itself is having an issue. I think we should go ahead and do that reset. Ready?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Let me get a paperclip... (pause) Alright, I'm pressing it.

Agent: (pause) How long are you holding it for?

Customer: I don't know, like... five seconds? Ten seconds?

Agent: Yeah, that should be good. Go ahead and let go and we'll let it reboot. This'll take a couple minutes.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's rebooting. The lights are going all crazy right now—they're like, blinking all over the place.

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, that's normal during a boot. That's actually what we want to see.

Customer: Alright... (pause) Okay, so now it's settled and I'm seeing green and... red again. Same thing.

Agent: Same situation? Still red blinking?

Customer: Yeah. Still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let me pull up your account one more time and check a few things here. (typing sounds) (pause) Michael, I'm going to be honest with you—the fact that the reset didn't help and you're still getting that red light suggests there might be an issue on our end with your line, or possibly an issue with the modem hardware itself.

Customer: What does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: It could be. Or it could be something with the signal coming into your house from our network. Those would require different solutions. Normally at this point I'd want to get a technician out to your house to diagnose the issue in person.

Customer: (sighs) How long would that take? I really need my internet back up today if I can.

Agent: Let me check our availability... (typing sounds) (pause) I've got an opening tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't you do anything today?

Agent: Unfortunately our tech is pretty booked up today. We could potentially get someone out there this evening, but it would be later—around 6 or 7 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: (pause) I guess... I guess this evening would be better. I've been without internet all day.

Agent: Alright, let me get you scheduled for this evening then. I've got you down for an appointment between 6 and 8 PM today. The technician will be able to test the line and either repair it or swap out your modem if that's the issue.

Customer: Okay. Do I need to do anything before they get here?

Agent: Just make sure there's someone home, and we'll take it from there. I'm really sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone, Michael. Usually that reset does the trick, but this sounds like it needs some hands-on attention.

Customer: Yeah, I understand. Thank you for trying.

Agent: Of course. And your appointment is confirmed for today between 6 and 8 PM. You should get a text confirmation in a few minutes with the technician's information. Is that the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yes, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. We really appreciate your patience, and we'll get you back online today.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
