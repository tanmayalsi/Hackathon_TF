# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, my internet went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the router and everything.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing an outage. Let me pull up your account here real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm seeing the account for... is this the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned you unplugged the router—that's a good first step. Let me ask you a few questions. When you look at your modem right now, what lights are you seeing on the front of it?

Customer: Uh... (pause) there's like... one light that's solid red. That's it. Everything else is either off or dark.

Agent: Okay, a solid red light—that usually indicates either a connection issue or a power problem. Is the modem plugged into a working outlet? Have you checked that?

Customer: Well, the power light would be on if it wasn't getting power, right? Like, shouldn't there be a power light?

Agent: That's actually a really good point. Let me check what model modem you have on file here. (typing sounds) Okay, so you've got the FrontierNet 3000 unit. With that model, if there's no power light at all, that typically means it's not receiving power. Can you try plugging it into a different outlet? Maybe one that you know is working—like maybe a lamp or something?

Customer: Yeah, okay, hold on. (pause) (background noise) I'm trying... let me just... (pause) Okay, I plugged it into the outlet where my lamp was. Still just the red light.

Agent: Hmm, interesting. Okay, so the red light is still there. Can you describe the red light for me? Is it blinking or steady?

Customer: It's steady. Just solid red. Doesn't look like it's doing anything.

Agent: Alright. And when you look at the back of the modem, do you see the cable that connects to the wall—the coaxial cable? It's the one that looks kind of like a... like a cable TV cord?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's plugged in.

Agent: Okay, great. Can you try unplugging that cable from the modem itself, wait about ten seconds, and then plug it back in?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, sure. (background noise) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) ...counting to ten... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about thirty seconds to reconnect. While we're waiting, have there been any storms in your area recently? Or any other disruptions?

Customer: Not that I noticed, no. It was working fine this morning. I was on a video call with my boss and then just... cut out.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. (pause) So it should be rebooting now. Are you seeing any change in those lights?

Customer: (pause) Nope. Still the same red light. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Alright, let me try a different approach. I'm going to check if there's a service issue in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) Let me see here... (pause) I'm not showing any reported outages in your neighborhood right now, which is good news and... well, it's also not great news because it means we need to dig a little deeper.

Customer: What do you mean?

Agent: Well, it's good because it means it's probably an issue we can resolve, but it does mean the problem is likely specific to your setup. Let me ask you—do you remember the last time everything was working? Was it this morning?

Customer: Yeah, this morning around ten or so. I got off the call and then checked my email like fifteen minutes later and realized I couldn't connect.

Agent: Okay. And you mentioned you've already done a hard reset on the router. Did you also do one on the modem, or just the router?

Customer: Oh... I just did the router. Do I need to reset the modem too?

Agent: Let's try it. So on the modem itself, there should be a small reset button—usually recessed so you need a paperclip or something to press it. Can you find that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think I see it. It's like a tiny little button on the back?

Agent: That's the one. Go ahead and hold that down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Okay, holding it... (pause) ...and release. (pause) What now?

Agent: Now just wait about two to three minutes and let the modem do a full restart. We should see multiple lights come on during this process. Let me stay on the line with you.

Customer: Okay. (pause) So far nothing's really changing. It's still that red light.

Agent: Still just the red? Hmm. (pause) How long has it been since you held the reset button?

Customer: Maybe like thirty seconds?

Agent: Alright, let's give it a bit more time. While we wait, let me ask—have you had any recent power outages or surges in your home? Sometimes that can affect the modem hardware itself.

Customer: Not that I'm aware of, no.

Agent: (pause) Okay, we're at about the two-minute mark now. Any changes?

Customer: (pause) No, man. It's still just red. I'm starting to think something's actually wrong with the modem itself, you know?

Agent: I understand your frustration. (pause) Let me try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem completely—both the power cable and the coaxial cable—and leave it unplugged for a full minute?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) (background noise) Alright, everything's unplugged. (pause) I'll wait.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Take your time.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been a minute. What do I do?

Agent: Go ahead and plug the coaxial cable back in first, then plug in the power cable.

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Okay... coax is back in... power is in... (pause) Now what?

Agent: Now let's watch those lights carefully. You should see some activity as it powers back on.

Customer: (pause) The red light's... wait, is that... (pause) no, it's still just red. This is frustrating.

Agent: I know, I'm sorry. (pause) Okay, I think at this point, what we might be looking at is a hardware issue with the modem itself. The fact that we're only seeing a solid red light with no other indicators after multiple reset attempts is... it's pointing in that direction.

Customer: So what does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: That's likely what we're going to need to do. Let me put you through to our provisioning department—they can arrange to get a replacement modem sent out to you, or you can come pick one up at a local Frontier office if that's more convenient.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back up. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. If we send one out, it typically takes two to three business days. If you pick up at a local office, that could potentially be today, depending on when you can get there. Let me just make sure I have the best contact number for you before I transfer you over. Is 555-0147 still the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Okay, perfect. And your address is still the one I have on file on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes.

Agent: Great. I'm going to transfer you now to our provisioning team—they'll be able to get you all set up with a replacement unit. They're going to take great care of you. You should stay on the line, and you'll be connected in just a moment.

Customer: Alright, thank you.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today. You should be back online very soon though. Have a great day.
