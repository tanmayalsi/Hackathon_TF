Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) Okay, I've got you. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan in the Northbrook area. So your internet is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely. The router's on, the modem's on, all the lights are... well, actually, now that I think about it, I'm not sure what the lights are supposed to be doing. There's like a red light blinking on the modem.

Agent: Okay, that's actually helpful information. A red light usually means there's no connection coming from our end. But let's try a few things. First, can you do a quick restart for me? Just unplug the modem and the router, and we'll wait about thirty seconds.

Customer: Sure, hold on. (background noise of items being unplugged) Yeah, they're both unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we're waiting, did anything change with your setup recently? New equipment, or did you move anything around?

Customer: No, no, nothing like that. It was working fine yesterday. I was using it this morning around six and then when I went to check email around nine, it was just gone.

Agent: Okay, that helps. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, it's plugged in. (pause) Lights are coming on now... looks like it's going through a startup sequence or something.

Agent: Good. Give that about thirty to forty seconds to fully boot up. While that's happening, go ahead and plug in the router.

Customer: (background noise) Router's back in. (pause) So... how long should this take?

Agent: Usually about a minute total for both devices. You should see the lights stabilize. What you're looking for is a solid green light on the modem, specifically the internet light. Do you see that yet?

Customer: Um, no. I see... green lights, but there's still a red one. It's the bottom one that's red.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and which light is red? Is it labeled on the modem?

Customer: Hold on, let me look closer. It says... "Internet" next to the red one. The others say "Power" and "WiFi" and they're both green.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. So the Internet light is the red one. That confirms what we saw before. Let me check something on my end. (pause) I'm actually seeing a signal issue on your line. When was the last time you were able to access the internet successfully?

Customer: Like I said, this morning around six. Everything was fine then.

Agent: Right, right. And you haven't noticed any storms or severe weather in your area?

Customer: No, it's actually been pretty nice out. Clear skies.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Let me try sending a refresh signal to your modem. That might help re-establish the connection. Just give me one moment.

Customer: Sure, take your time.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I've sent that through. Can you check if anything's changed on the modem display?

Customer: (pause) Nope, still red.

Agent: Still showing red on the Internet light?

Customer: Yeah, same as before.

Agent: Alright. Let me try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? There should be a small reset button. You'll need something like a paperclip to press it.

Customer: Um, yeah, I think I see it. Little hole on the back?

Agent: That's the one. If you hold it in for about ten seconds, the modem should restart completely.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm holding it in... (pause) ...and the lights are going off now.

Agent: Good. Let it go through its startup cycle again. This might take a minute or two.

Customer: (pause) Okay, lights are coming back on. (longer pause) Still red on the Internet light.

Agent: Still red?

Customer: Yeah.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at the signal levels coming in from your line and... it's showing as no signal at all. That typically means the issue is either with the line connection from the street or with the modem itself. Let me just ask—is your internet working right now?

Customer: No, like I said, that's why I called you guys.

Agent: Right, sorry. I know, just checking. (pause) Okay, James, I think what we're looking at here is either a line issue outside your home or potentially a modem failure. Have you noticed any cable damage or anything unusual outside your house?

Customer: I haven't really looked. Should I go check?

Agent: If you don't mind, yeah, that could be helpful. Just take a quick look at the cable line coming to your house. See if there's any visible damage—cuts, loose connections, anything like that.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I'm going outside now. (pause) (wind noise) Okay, I'm looking at the line. Um... I don't see anything obvious. There's a cable line running from the pole to the side of my house and... it looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay, and is there anything loose where the cable connects to your house?

Customer: (pause) Not that I can see.

Agent: Alright. (pause) I think at this point, we've tried the basic troubleshooting steps. The signal from our network isn't reaching your modem, and I'm not able to reestablish it remotely. This is pointing to either a line issue that's going to require a technician to investigate, or the modem may need to be replaced.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long until someone can come out?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest we have available is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's not... I mean, can't you guys come out today?

Agent: I wish I could get someone out there today, but our technicians are fully booked. Tomorrow is the soonest opening we have.

Customer: (frustrated) This is ridiculous. I've had Frontier for five years and now I can't even get internet for a day.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, James. I really do. And I apologize that we can't get to you sooner. If there's any way I can help prioritize this, I'll... let me see if there's any same-day appointments. (pause) Unfortunately, I'm not seeing anything available today.

Customer: (pause) Fine. Fine, let's schedule it for tomorrow. Morning time is better.

Agent: Okay, I can get you in for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM. I'm going to text you a confirmation code and a technician will be assigned within the next hour or so. Does the phone number on file—is that 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And is there anything else I can help clarify about the appointment or anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: (pause) No, I guess that's... that's it. I just hope this gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I hope so too, James. I'm really sorry we couldn't resolve this today. Our technician will definitely be able to get to the root of the problem. In the meantime, if anything changes or if you figure anything else out, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye, James.
