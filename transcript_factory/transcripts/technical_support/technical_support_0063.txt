Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. Um, so my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have there been any storms in your area or any kind of service disruptions that you're aware of?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine all day. It just... stopped working around 8 a.m. I was in the middle of working from home and it just went out. One second it was fine and the next second, nothing.

Agent: Okay. And have you tried restarting your modem and router yet?

Customer: Yeah, I did that right away. I unplugged them, waited like five minutes, plugged them back in, and... nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, good thinking on that. Um, so when you say nothing, can you describe what you're seeing? Is the modem showing any lights at all?

Customer: The modem has some lights on it. Like, the power light is on, and there's a couple of other lights that are blinking, but I don't really know what they mean, to be honest.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's helpful. Can you tell me which lights are on and which ones are blinking? Usually there's a power light, an internet light, maybe a Wi-Fi light...

Customer: Um, let me look here. (pause) There's definitely a green light on the left side. And then there's like a yellow light that's blinking in the middle.

Agent: Okay, so the green light is likely your power indicator, which is good. But that yellow blinking light is usually an indication that the modem isn't syncing properly with our network. Let me ask you a couple more questions. Are you getting any error messages on your computer or phone?

Customer: No error messages, just... no connection. It says I'm connected to the Wi-Fi network, but there's no internet. Like, the Wi-Fi symbol shows up, but when I try to load anything, it just times out.

Agent: Right, so the Wi-Fi is broadcasting, but there's no actual internet connection coming through. That makes sense with what we're seeing on the modem side. Um, let me try a couple of things here. First, can you unplug the modem for me again? I'm going to check our systems on this end while it's rebooting.

Customer: Yeah, unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: (typing sounds) So I'm looking at your account here and I'm not seeing any service outages reported in your area, and your account looks active and in good standing. Let me see if there's been any recent changes... (longer pause) Hmm, okay. Go ahead and plug that modem back in for me.

Customer: Plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Great. While that's booting back up, I want to try something else. On your router, do you see a reset button or a pinhole reset button?

Customer: Uh, let me check. (pause) Yeah, I see a little recessed button on the back. Is that it?

Agent: That's probably it, yeah. But let's not touch that yet. First, let me see if the modem stabilizes. Can you tell me when you see that green power light come back on?

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back on now. And the yellow light is still blinking.

Agent: Still blinking, hmm. (pause) Alright, this is a bit unusual. Normally after a full reboot, we'd see that stabilize within a minute or two. Can you check your cables for me? I want to make sure everything's connected properly. First, is there a coaxial cable going into the modem? It's usually a thicker cable with a metal connector.

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I see it. It's plugged in pretty tight.

Agent: And that cable is coming from... where exactly? Is it from the wall outlet or from another box?

Customer: It's from the wall. There's like a cable outlet in the wall and it goes right to the modem.

Agent: Okay, good. Can you try gently unscrewing that coaxial cable from the modem and screwing it back in? Sometimes they come loose.

Customer: (pause, sounds of movement) Okay, I loosened it a bit and I'm screwing it back in. (pause) Should I tighten it all the way?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and snug it up. Not too hard, but just make sure it's secure.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's tight now. (longer pause) But... the yellow light is still blinking. Is anything changing on your end?

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) No, I'm not seeing any change. The modem still isn't provisioning. This might be an issue on the line side. Can you tell me, have you had any work done on your service recently? Any technician visits or anything like that?

Customer: No, not recently. Everything was working fine until this morning.

Agent: [inaudible] ...okay. Um, I think what we might be looking at here is either a signal issue coming into your home or possibly a modem issue. Let me try one more thing. Can you tell me the model number of your modem? It should be on a sticker somewhere on the device.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's a Frontier... um... Model FGW-C300X.

Agent: Okay, that's what I have here in my system. That's one of our newer models. (pause) Alright, I want you to try holding down the reset button for about ten seconds to factory reset the modem. This will clear any settings and force it to reprovision from our network.

Customer: Okay, I'm holding it down. (pause, longer pause) How long should I hold it?

Agent: Around ten seconds. Count to ten.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm at ten. Let me let go... (longer pause) Everything's gone dark now.

Agent: That's normal. It's resetting. Give it about two to three minutes to fully boot back up and start the provisioning process again. While we wait, I can check a few more things on my end. Has there been any recent changes to your account? Did you recently switch plans or add any services?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Same plan I've had for two years.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Go ahead and give me an update on those lights whenever you see them come back on.

Customer: (longer pause) Okay, so it's back up. Power light is green again, but... that yellow light is still just blinking. It's been about a minute now and it's still the same.

Agent: It's still blinking, okay. (pause, longer typing sounds) Yeah, so I'm seeing that the modem is still not registering on our network as provisioned. This is... typically indicates either a signal problem on the line or a hardware issue with the modem itself. (pause) What I'd like to do is schedule a technician to come out and check the line and test the modem in person. That way we can figure out exactly what's going on.

Customer: How long would that take? Like, when could someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) It looks like we have availability tomorrow between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m., or the day after between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow morning would be better for me if that works.

Agent: Great. I'll get that scheduled for you. Just to make sure, is someone going to be home tomorrow morning?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you're aware, this is a paid service call since we're not seeing an outage on our end. It'll be $99.99, but if it turns out to be a network issue on our side, we'll waive that fee.

Customer: Okay, I understand. Hopefully it's something simple.

Agent: I hope so too. Alright, so we have a technician scheduled for tomorrow between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. You should receive a confirmation call about an hour before they arrive. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can figure it out.

Agent: I'm sure they will. I'm sorry we weren't able to get this resolved over the phone, but the technician should be able to get to the bottom of it. Thanks for your patience today, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.
