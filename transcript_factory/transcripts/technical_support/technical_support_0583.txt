Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I can't figure out what's going on. I've got a work meeting in like an hour and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I definitely understand the urgency. Let me pull up your account here and we'll see what we can do. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. So your service went down this morning, is that right? And you haven't made any changes to your equipment recently?

Customer: No, nothing. Everything was working fine yesterday. I woke up this morning and just... nothing. No lights on the modem or anything.

Agent: Alright, let's start with the basics then. Can you check if your modem is plugged in? I know it sounds simple, but...

Customer: (chuckles) Yeah, I already checked that. It's plugged in. The power cord is definitely connected.

Agent: Good, good. And, um, do you see any lights on the modem at all? Even just a power light?

Customer: (pause) No, nothing. It's completely dark. That's what's weird about it.

Agent: Okay, so no lights at all. That does sound like a power issue then. Let me have you try something. Can you unplug the modem for about thirty seconds and then plug it back in?

Customer: Sure, hold on. (background noise of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just... just give it about thirty seconds while we wait.

Customer: (pause) Okay, thirty seconds is up. (background noise) Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. Now, let's give it a minute or two to boot up. While that's happening, is the router a separate device or is it all in one unit?

Customer: It's all in one. The Frontier box.

Agent: Got it. So just keep an eye on it and let me know when you see some lights come on.

Customer: (pause) Um... still nothing. Still completely dark. This is strange.

Agent: Hmm, yeah, that is odd. So we're not seeing any power indicator at all?

Customer: Nope. Completely black.

Agent: Okay. Can you try a different outlet? Sometimes outlets can go bad, especially if something else tripped a breaker.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Let me... (background noise, sounds of moving things) Alright, I've got it moved to a different outlet in the living room. (pause) Nope, still nothing.

Agent: Still no lights?

Customer: Still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Alright, um, that's definitely indicating a hardware issue then. Let me ask you—when the power went out, was there a storm or anything like that in your area? Power surge, anything?

Customer: Actually, yeah. Now that you mention it, there was some pretty heavy rain and lightning last night. I didn't think about that.

Agent: That could very well be it. Lightning and power surges can definitely damage equipment. Let me try one more thing. Can you check the back of the modem and see if there's a small reset button? It might be recessed.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's a little hole back here.

Agent: Okay, so if you have a paper clip or something small and pointy, you can press and hold that for about ten seconds. That'll do a factory reset.

Customer: Okay. (background noise) I'm doing it now. (pause) Holding it... and... (pause) Okay, released it. (long pause) Still nothing. The modem's still dark.

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately, if it's not getting any power at all and it's not responding to a reset, that sounds like the modem itself may have been damaged by the power surge.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Am I going to need a new one?

Agent: (pause) Well, let me check a couple more things first. Um, can you tell me—do you have any other devices plugged into that outlet now?

Customer: The lamp. And my phone charger, I think.

Agent: And those are working fine?

Customer: Yeah, they're working.

Agent: Okay, so the outlet itself is fine. That pretty much confirms that it's the modem that's the issue. Now, we can definitely get you a replacement device shipped out. Normally that takes three to five business days, but given your situation, let me see... (typing sounds) what I can do here.

Customer: That's not gonna work for me. I need internet today. I have work calls and stuff.

Agent: I understand, and I wish I could get someone out there today. Let me check what our availability looks like for a technician visit. (pause) Unfortunately, our next available appointment is... that's showing Thursday afternoon. This is Tuesday, so...

Customer: Thursday? That's not gonna work. Can't you guys send someone out sooner? Or can I just go pick up a modem somewhere?

Agent: Let me check on that. (typing sounds) So, we don't have any retail locations, unfortunately. Everything goes through us. But I can... let me talk to my supervisor real quick to see if there's anything we can do to expedite this. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent: (brief hold music, then agent returns) Thanks for holding. So, I talked to my supervisor and the earliest we could potentially get a tech out there is Wednesday morning. Would that work for you?

Customer: Wednesday morning is better, but... I really need it today if possible. Is there seriously nothing we can do?

Agent: (pause) I know this is frustrating. The issue is that we're fully booked for today and tomorrow. Wednesday's really the soonest we have available, and that would be between 8 AM and noon.

Customer: (sighs) I guess Wednesday morning's better than Thursday. Can you at least guarantee someone will be here?

Agent: I'll put you down for our first available window Wednesday morning. We can't guarantee an exact time, but it'll be between 8 and noon. If we can get there sooner, we will.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Wednesday morning. What else do I need to do?

Agent: So we'll have a technician come out and assess the equipment. They'll bring a replacement modem with them and get you back up and running. Is the contact number on your account still good?

Customer: Yeah, that's still my cell number.

Agent: Great, so we'll call you Wednesday morning before the tech arrives. Let me get that appointment on your account here. (typing sounds) You're all set for Wednesday, between 8 AM and noon. Your confirmation number is 4429587.

Customer: Okay. So just to confirm, someone's gonna show up Wednesday morning with a new modem?

Agent: That's correct. They'll install it and get your internet back up and running. And I apologize again that we couldn't get someone out sooner.

Customer: Yeah, well... I guess it is what it is. Hopefully the storm damage thing is covered or whatever.

Agent: So, regarding the power surge damage—that would typically be covered under our equipment protection plan if you have that on your account. Let me check. (typing sounds) It doesn't look like you have that currently, so unfortunately the replacement would incur a one-time equipment fee of $99.

Customer: (frustrated) Are you serious? I'm not responsible for a lightning strike.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. The power surge was beyond anyone's control. Unfortunately, without the protection plan, that's the standard fee for equipment replacement. However, let me put a note on your account. Sometimes our retention team can work with you on that. When the technician comes out Wednesday, mention it and they might be able to help.

Customer: Alright, fine. Just... make sure someone comes out Wednesday.

Agent: Absolutely. You're confirmed for Wednesday morning, 8 AM to noon. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this today, but we'll get you back online as soon as possible. You have a great day, and thank you for being a Frontier customer.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
