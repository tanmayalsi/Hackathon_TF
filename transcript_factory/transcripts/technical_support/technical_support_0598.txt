Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I need to get this fixed pretty quickly if possible.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. One moment... Alright, I've got your account here. It looks like you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Riverside area. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So the internet has been down since this morning, you said? Do you remember around what time that was?

Customer: I'd say around 7 or 8 AM? I tried to check my emails and nothing was loading. I waited about an hour thinking maybe it was just a glitch, but it's still not working.

Agent: Okay, understood. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, I need you to locate your modem and router. Can you see them right now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at them. They're both on the shelf above my desk.

Agent: Great. Now, what I want you to do is look at the lights on your modem. Can you tell me what color they are and which ones are lit up?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... I see the power light is green. Um, the internet light is... it's red. And the other lights are just off, I think.

Agent: Alright, so the red light on the internet port—that's actually what we need to fix. That typically means there's no connection coming from our network. Before we do anything else, let's try a hard reset. I want you to unplug the modem from the power outlet.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds, and then go ahead and plug it back in while I'm talking to you.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in... it's booting up now.

Agent: Perfect. That's going to take a minute or so. While we're waiting, let me ask you—have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time you've had issues?

Customer: No, this is the first time. I've had Frontier for like two years and it's been pretty solid until now.

Agent: That's good to know. Okay, and I can see here that there haven't been any reported outages on our end in your area this morning. How's that modem looking now? Is the internet light still red?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, it's still red. The power light is green again, but that internet light hasn't changed.

Agent: Okay, that's alright. Let's try the next step. I want you to check your router as well. Can you look at the lights on that?

Customer: Yeah, so the power light is on, it's white. But I don't really see any... internet lights or anything like that on the router. Is that normal?

Agent: It depends on the model. What router model do you have? It should say on the bottom or the back.

Customer: (pause) It says... Frontier FXR Pro-2000 or something like that.

Agent: Okay, so on that model, you should actually see some indicator lights that show connection status. If those aren't lit up, that would explain why you don't have internet. Let me try something else. I'm going to check if we can see the modem connecting on our end. (typing sounds) One moment, please.

(brief hold music)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So on our end, it's showing that your modem is not registering a connection to our network at all. That could mean either there's an issue with the line coming into your house, or there's something wrong with the modem itself.

Customer: Oh, great. (sighs) So what do we do about that?

Agent: Well, here's what I'd like you to do. Can you check the cable coming into your modem? It should be a coaxial cable—it's the one that screws into the back of the modem. I need you to just make sure it's screwed in tight.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm checking... it looks pretty tight to me. Should I try unscrewing it and putting it back?

Agent: Go ahead and try that. Sometimes they can come loose without you noticing.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unscrewing... and... screwing it back in... There we go. Should I wait and see if that fixes it?

Agent: Yeah, give it about another minute to establish the connection.

(pause)

Customer: Nope, still red. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, and the cable that's screwed in—that's coming from the wall, correct? There should be a cable jack on your wall?

Customer: Yes, yeah, there's a jack on the wall. That's where the cable's coming from.

Agent: Can you check that jack? Make sure the cable is screwed in firmly on that end too?

Customer: (pause) Oh, huh. It's actually a little loose. Let me tighten that up.

Customer: Okay, I'm tightening it now... (pause) It's in there pretty good.

Agent: Excellent. Let's give it another moment to see if that makes a difference.

(longer pause)

Customer: I'm... I'm still not seeing anything change on the modem. The internet light is still red.

Agent: Hmm, okay. At this point, I want to try one more thing. Let's do a full factory reset on the modem. Are you still near it?

Customer: Yeah, I'm right here.

Agent: Okay, on the back of the modem, there should be a small reset button. It might be recessed. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) I think so? There's like a little hole... is that it?

Agent: That's it. I'm going to need you to use something small and pointy—like a paperclip or the end of a pen—to press that button. Hold it for about 10 seconds.

Customer: Okay, I've got a pen here... (pause) Pressing the button... I'm holding it... (pause) Still holding... okay, that should be 10 seconds. I let go.

Agent: Good. The modem is going to reboot now. This can take a few minutes, so just hang with me here. (pause) How are you doing? You at work or home today?

Customer: Home, thankfully. I'm supposed to have a video meeting in like an hour, so I'm kind of hoping we can get this sorted out pretty quickly.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check on the status of that modem now. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm still not seeing it register on our network side. And is the internet light still red there?

Customer: Yeah, it is. I don't know what's going on. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I know, and I'm sorry about that. So at this point, I think what might be happening is either there's an issue with the line itself coming from the street, or the modem may have failed. Since we've tried all the troubleshooting steps, I think we need to get a technician out to your place to take a look.

Customer: A technician? How long is that going to take? Like I said, I have a meeting in an hour.

Agent: I understand that. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so the earliest we can get someone out to you would be... it looks like tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. I wish I could get someone out there sooner, but that's what we have available today.

Customer: Tomorrow? That's not going to work for me. Is there anything else we can try?

Agent: (pause) Well, um... the only other thing I can suggest is checking if you have any other cables or connections near the modem that might have gotten disconnected, but honestly, based on what we've tried here, I'm pretty confident it's either a line issue or the modem itself. A technician will be able to pinpoint the exact problem and potentially replace the modem if that's what's needed.

Customer: This is ridiculous. Can I at least get the appointment confirmed for tomorrow?

Agent: Of course. Let me just confirm a few details for you. You're still at 555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Okay, and you're available between 12 and 4 PM tomorrow?

Customer: I guess I'll have to be.

Agent: I'm going to schedule you for tomorrow, and you should receive a confirmation text and email. A technician will come out and diagnose the problem. Is there anything else I can help you with right now?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope this gets resolved tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize that we weren't able to get this working today. The technician will definitely be able to help. Thanks for being so patient with me, and I'm sorry again for the inconvenience.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Okay, bye.

Agent: Take care!
