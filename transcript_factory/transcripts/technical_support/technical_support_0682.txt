Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it back up and running.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Let me just pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I see your account here under... Michael Torres? Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage this morning, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. I tried unplugging the modem and the router like I always do when things get weird, but this time nothing's working. The lights on the modem aren't even coming on.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. The fact that there are no lights on the modem suggests there might be a power issue. Let me ask you—when you unplugged it, did you wait a full minute or two before plugging it back in?

Customer: Uh, maybe thirty seconds? I didn't wait that long, to be honest. Should I try again?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. That would really help. Why don't you unplug the modem right now, and let's wait about two minutes. I'll be right here on the line with you.

Customer: (background noise of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) So while we're waiting... I've had Frontier for like three years now, and this is the first real issue I've had, so I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: That's good to hear that you haven't had problems before. Hopefully this is just a simple reset. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (plugging sounds, beeping) Okay, plugged back in. Um... the lights are starting to come on now. I see... there's like a power light and... okay, there's some green lights flashing.

Agent: Excellent! That's a really good sign. So you should see the lights cycle through for maybe thirty to forty-five seconds as it boots up. Just let me know when things stabilize.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so now... yeah, I see solid green lights. It looks like it's connected or whatever.

Agent: Perfect! So now let's check your router. Is that powered on as well?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, it's been on the whole time. The lights look normal.

Agent: Great. Now, let me have you try opening a web browser on your computer or phone and see if you're able to connect to the internet. Can you try that for me?

Customer: Sure, one sec. (pause) Okay, I'm on my laptop. (pause) Nope, still nothing. It says I can connect to the network, but when I try to go to any websites, it's just... it's not loading anything. It's timing out.

Agent: Hmm, okay. So you can see the WiFi network and you're connected to it, but you're not getting internet through. Let me ask you a couple more questions. Have you noticed any storms or power outages in your area recently?

Customer: No, not that I... well, actually, there was that thing last night around midnight or so. I think there was a brief power flicker. I didn't really think about it until now.

Agent: Ah, that might be relevant actually. Sometimes power surges can affect the equipment. Let me try a few more things here. Can you try unplugging your router as well? Just for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (sighing) Okay, sure. (pause) Both of them are unplugged now. How long do I wait?

Agent: Thirty seconds should be fine this time. Go ahead and count it out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, thirty seconds is up. Plugging the modem back in first.

Agent: Yes, exactly. Give that a minute to fully boot up before you plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause, beeping sounds) Yeah, it's looking the same as before. Green lights, everything looks good. (plugging sounds) Okay, router's back in too.

Agent: Good. Now let's give it about a minute for everything to fully sync up.

Customer: (pause) Alright, trying the internet again. Going to go to Google... (pause) ...nope. Same thing. It's not loading. I'm connected to the WiFi but nothing's loading.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to check something on my end here. (typing sounds, pause) Michael, I'm showing your modem as offline in our system. That's... that's actually odd because you're telling me the lights look normal.

Customer: What do you mean offline? Like, the internet connection is down on your end?

Agent: Possibly. Let me pull up your service area to see if there are any reported outages. (pause) I'm not seeing any widespread outages in your neighborhood. (pause) Did the modem indicator lights come back on after you plugged it back in? Specifically, is there an internet light that's solid or blinking?

Customer: Um, let me look closer. I see power, and then... I don't know, there's like three or four other lights. I see... (squinting) ...one that says internet, and I think it's... it's not on? Like, it's dark.

Agent: Ah, okay. That's actually the issue right there. That internet light should be either solid green or blinking. The fact that it's off means the modem isn't syncing with our network properly. This could indicate a few different things. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you check the cable connection in the back of the modem? Make sure the coax cable is tightly connected?

Customer: (rustling sounds) Yeah, okay, let me get back there. (pause) It looks pretty tight to me. I don't know. I can try tightening it, I guess. (twisting sounds) 

Agent: Good. And you didn't notice the cable disconnecting or anything before the outage started?

Customer: No, I didn't touch it. It's been fine.

Agent: Okay. Well, let's give it another minute to see if re-seating that cable helps. (pause) Any change?

Customer: (pause) No, the internet light is still not on.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Unfortunately, it sounds like the issue might be with the modem itself or potentially a line issue that's preventing it from connecting to our network. Given that you experienced a power surge last night, it's possible the equipment was damaged. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Are you saying I need to replace it?

Agent: Well, we have a couple of options. The first thing I'd like to do is set up a technician visit. They can come out and verify that the line is working properly on our end, and if the modem is faulty, we can replace that as well. That typically takes two to three business days to schedule.

Customer: Two to three days? I need internet before then. Can't you just... I don't know, troubleshoot this more?

Agent: (pause) I understand, Michael, and I wish I could resolve this immediately over the phone. But at this point, with the internet indicator light not illuminating after all our reset attempts, it really does need to be looked at physically. There could be a signal issue or the modem hardware might be compromised.

Customer: Is there any way to get someone out sooner? Like tomorrow?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds, pause) I'm looking at tomorrow's schedule... unfortunately, all the slots for tomorrow are booked. The earliest I can get you is Thursday between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Thursday morning? Ugh, I have to work from home, and this is really frustrating. But I guess I don't have a choice, right?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'm sorry we're dealing with this. Ideally, we'd have gotten this resolved today. But Thursday morning we can get this sorted out. The technician will be able to bring a replacement modem if needed and get your service restored.

Customer: Okay, fine. Thursday morning.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule that for you now. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you down for Thursday, March 14th between 8 AM and 12 PM. You'll receive a confirmation text and email with those details. Is the best number to reach you the one on file, 555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's fine.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, we did try everything we could tonight. The issue is most likely hardware-related or a signal issue on the line, which is why the technician needs to assess it in person. In the meantime, do you have access to mobile hotspot or any other internet connection if you absolutely need to get something done?

Customer: I have mobile hotspot on my phone, so I guess I can use that if it's urgent.

Agent: Good, that should at least help in a pinch. Michael, I really do apologize that we couldn't get this resolved tonight. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm just... frustrated, but I understand. So Thursday morning, I'll be here.

Agent: Thank you for your patience, and again, I'm sorry we're dealing with this. The technician will have all the information they need, and we'll make sure to get you back up and running. You have a good night, Michael.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
