Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, uh... my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried restarting everything but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And your name?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Let me just... okay, I've got you here. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Do you have any lights on your router right now? Like, is it powered on?

Customer: Yeah, it's powered on. I see the lights... there's a green one, I think, and then there's like a red one blinking? Is that normal?

Agent: Okay, so that red blinking light—that usually indicates a connectivity issue. That's what we'd expect to see if you're not connected to our network. Have you tried unplugging the router and waiting about thirty seconds before plugging it back in?

Customer: I did that already this morning. That was like the first thing I tried.

Agent: Right, good thinking. Okay, um... (pause) let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your service in our system and... I'm seeing that everything appears to be active on our end. Your modem should be getting a signal. When you say you restarted everything, did you also restart your modem? Not just the router, but the modem itself?

Customer: Oh. Um... I'm not sure if I did that. Where's the modem? I thought they were the same thing?

Agent: No, no worries—a lot of people think that. So you should have two devices. One is typically smaller and has the company name on it, and that's your modem. The other one, usually a little bigger with more antennas, that's your router. The modem is the one that actually connects to the line coming into your house.

Customer: Oh, okay. So I need to restart that one too?

Agent: Exactly. Yeah, can you locate it for me?

Customer: (pause) Okay, give me a second... yeah, I found it. It's in the closet by the door.

Agent: Great. So I want you to unplug the modem first. Just pull out the power cable.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now just wait about thirty seconds for me. Count it out if you can.

Customer: (background noise of shuffling) Thirty seconds... okay, done.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (sound of cable being inserted) Okay, plugged back in.

Agent: And now let's give it a minute or so to boot back up. While we wait, have you noticed any storms in your area recently? Or maybe any work being done on the lines outside?

Customer: Hmm, no storms that I know of. There was a truck... maybe Frontier or something? I saw it two days ago on the street, but I don't think they were at my house.

Agent: Okay, that's useful info. Sometimes work in the area can affect things. (pause) Alright, so on your modem now, you should start seeing some lights come back on. What are you seeing?

Customer: Um... the green light is back on now. The red one is still blinking though.

Agent: Still blinking, okay. (typing sounds) Let me pull up a diagnostic on your line. (pause) [inaudible] ...moment... (longer pause) So, I'm showing that we are... hmm. David, I'm not seeing a connection being established between your modem and our network. That red light you're seeing? That's indicating your modem isn't syncing with our equipment at the pole.

Customer: What does that mean? Like, what's wrong with it?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be an issue with the modem itself, a line issue, or something at our end. Let me try a couple more things first. Have you checked to see if there's a reset button on the back of the modem? It's usually a small, recessed button.

Customer: (pause, sound of modem being moved around) Yeah, I see it. Do I press it?

Agent: Not yet. Before we do a full reset, which would erase your settings, let me check one more thing. Are there any cables that look loose or damaged where the line comes into your modem?

Customer: (pause) Uh... I don't know. I don't really... I mean, they look okay to me? They're just plugged in. There's one thick cable coming from the wall.

Agent: Okay, so that thick cable—can you just unplug that for a few seconds and then plug it back in? Make sure it's nice and snug?

Customer: (sound of cable being removed and reinserted) Okay, done. I don't think anything changed though.

Agent: Give it just another fifteen seconds or so. (pause) Any change in the lights?

Customer: (pause) No... still the same. Green light on, and that red one blinking.

Agent: (sighs) Alright, David. So at this point, I've run through the basic troubleshooting steps and what I'm seeing on my end is that your modem isn't connecting to our network. This could mean a few different things. One possibility is that your modem itself has gone bad and needs to be replaced. Another possibility is that there's actually an issue on the line itself coming into your house that we can't see from here.

Customer: So... what does that mean? What do I do?

Agent: Well, normally I would recommend we send a technician out to your location to do a physical inspection of your line and equipment. They'd be able to diagnose exactly what's happening and either repair it or replace your modem if needed.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back, man. I've got work to do at home today.

Agent: (typing sounds) I completely understand. Let me see what's available... (pause) The earliest I'm showing is tomorrow afternoon, sometime between 1 and 5 PM. Or I could possibly get someone out there the day after tomorrow in the morning.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon? I mean... I guess I'll have to do that. But is there anything else we can try right now?

Agent: (pause) Um... let me think here. You could try doing a full reset on the modem if you want. Again, that will clear all the settings, but sometimes that does help. But I have to be honest with you—based on what I'm seeing and what we've already tried, I'm fairly confident this is going to be a hardware issue or a line issue, not something we can fix over the phone.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, let's try the reset then. What do I do?

Agent: Alright, so see that reset button? Go ahead and hold it down with a pen or something pointy for about ten seconds. It'll take a minute or so for the modem to restart.

Customer: (sound of clicking and beeping) Okay, I'm holding it. (pause) Okay, letting go now.

Agent: (pause) Just give it a minute to boot back up and reinitialize.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Nope. Still the same red blinking light. Still not working.

Agent: (pause) Yeah. Okay, so unfortunately it looks like the reset didn't resolve it. At this point, I'm confident we need to get a technician out. Let me go ahead and schedule that appointment for you for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM. Is that okay?

Customer: (hesitant) Yeah, I guess. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home and can let the technician in. They'll have their Frontier van, so you'll know they're coming. They'll be able to assess the situation and get you back online as quickly as possible.

Customer: Alright. Can I get a confirmation number or something?

Agent: Of course. (typing sounds) Your appointment number is 847592. That'll be tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. You should also receive a text and email confirming this. Is the contact information on file still correct?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. Well David, I apologize we couldn't get you back online today. I really wish we could have resolved this over the phone. But our technician should be able to take care of this for you tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, I understand. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. If you have any other questions before tomorrow, feel free to give us a call back. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, well thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
