Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up and running. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing service at that address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Okay, so you're experiencing no internet at all this morning. When did you first notice it went down?

Customer: I'd say around 8 AM? I went to check my email and nothing was working. I tried unplugging the modem and router, waited like five minutes, plugged it back in... still nothing.

Agent: That's a good troubleshooting step, thank you for doing that. Let me check our systems here to see if there are any outages in your area. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Are there any lights on the modem or router?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, actually, the modem has a red light on it. Is that bad?

Agent: The red light typically indicates either no connection or a power issue. Let's start with the basics. Can you make sure the power cable is firmly connected to the modem?

Customer: (background noise of movement) Okay, I'm looking at it now. Let me just... yeah, it seems pretty tight already, but let me check it.

Agent: Good.

Customer: (pause) No, it's definitely plugged in. The cord is... it's secure.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm, the modem is the device that connects directly to the wall outlet and usually has the Frontier branding on it, right?

Customer: Oh, wait. Is that different from the router? Because I have two boxes.

Agent: Yes, exactly. The modem is the one that connects to the wall, and the router is usually separate. So the modem has the red light, you're saying?

Customer: Yeah, the modem has the red light. The router... (pause) the router doesn't seem to have any lights on at all now that I think about it.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Is the router plugged in?

Customer: (pause) Oh. Oh man. (awkward laugh) Yeah, it's... it wasn't plugged in all the way. I don't know how that happened. Let me plug it in.

Agent: No problem, these things happen.

Customer: (background noise, pause) Okay, it's plugged in now. Do I need to wait for anything?

Agent: Give it about two minutes to boot up. While we're waiting, let me just verify a couple of things. Are you on our Fiber 100 plan?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. Is that the one that's supposed to be pretty fast?

Agent: That's correct. You should be getting around 100 megabits per download. (pause) Okay, has it been about two minutes?

Customer: Yeah, pretty much. Um, the router has some lights on it now, but the modem still has that red light.

Agent: Alright. And do you see any lights that might indicate internet connection on the modem? Sometimes there's a separate light for that.

Customer: (pause) There's... there's a few lights on the modem now, but none of them are green. It's like... one is red, and one is kind of orange or yellow?

Agent: Okay, I want you to look at the label on top of or back of the modem. Can you tell me what model it is?

Customer: Yeah, let me look... It says... "Arista" something? No wait... "Actiontec" I think?

Agent: Actiontec, got it. And on that modem, typically the internet light should be green. If it's red or orange, that usually means the modem isn't syncing properly with our network. Let me try something from my end here. (typing sounds) I'm going to reboot your modem remotely. Can you just wait a moment?

Customer: Sure, yeah.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I've sent the reboot command. You should see the lights on the modem go dark and then come back on. This might take about three to five minutes.

Customer: Okay, (pause) yeah I can see the lights going off now. (pause) We'll wait.

Agent: (silence, pause) So, how long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, about... three years maybe? I've had pretty good luck with the service until today.

Agent: That's great to hear. (pause) Okay, you should be seeing the lights come back on now. What are you seeing?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, they're back on. But... (pause) that red light is still there.

Agent: Still red?

Customer: Yeah.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, that's unusual. Let me check your line status here. (pause, typing sounds) I'm actually seeing that your line is showing as disconnected on our end. That might mean there's an issue with the connection coming into your home. Have you noticed any changes to the cables or anything outside?

Customer: Like... outside the house? No, I haven't been out there. Well, we had some heavy rain last night, but I don't know if that would affect anything.

Agent: That could potentially be related. Sometimes weather can affect the connection points. Let me see if we can do a factory reset on the modem. This will erase all the settings, but I can reconfigure it from here. Are you comfortable with that?

Customer: Yeah, whatever you think is best.

Agent: Okay, on the back of the modem, there should be a small recessed button labeled "Reset." You'll need to hold it down for about ten seconds with a paperclip or something similar.

Customer: (background noise, pause) Okay, I'm doing it now. (pause) The lights went out completely.

Agent: That's expected. They should come back on in a moment. (pause) Okay, and now let's wait for full boot-up again, so about three to five minutes.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, I'm just... standing here watching it.

Agent: I know it's not the most exciting part of troubleshooting. (chuckles) While we wait, can I get your best contact number in case we get disconnected?

Customer: Yeah, it's 503-555-0147, same as my account number area code.

Agent: Perfect, I've got that down. (pause) Okay, how's it looking now?

Customer: Um, the same as before. Red light, orange light. Still no internet.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me... let me check something. (typing sounds, long pause) I'm actually showing that there might be a service disruption on the line feeding your neighborhood. It looks like there was a repair ticket opened for this morning around 8:15 AM, which is when you noticed your outage. Let me see the status here... (pause, typing sounds) 

Customer: Okay, so like, is it something on my end or their end?

Agent: It looks like it's on our network infrastructure side. However, the ticket isn't showing a completion status yet. Let me make a note here that you're experiencing no internet at all with a red light on the modem. (typing sounds) This should escalate it. I'm going to need you to—

Customer: Wait, so does that mean there's nothing I can do?

Agent: Unfortunately, if this is an infrastructure issue, it's something our field technicians need to address. However, I don't want to just send you off without exploring all options. Let me try one more thing. Can you check the cable connection where it comes into the modem? The coaxial cable?

Customer: The coax? Where is that?

Agent: It's the cable that looks like it has a metal connector on the end, similar to a cable TV connection. It comes into the back of the modem from the wall.

Customer: (background noise, pause) Oh yeah, I see it. It looks pretty secure.

Agent: Can you unscrew it just slightly and screw it back on? Sometimes they can become slightly loose.

Customer: (pause, sounds of movement) Okay, I'm unscrewing it... and screwing it back on. (pause) Did that work?

Agent: Let me check the line status again. (pause, typing sounds, long pause) I'm still not seeing a connection coming through on our end. I think at this point, we're going to need to have a technician come out and look at the infrastructure on the line. [inaudible] the appointment... Let me see what we have available.

Customer: Oh, so you can't fix it remotely?

Agent: Unfortunately not. The issue appears to be with the line itself, not the equipment at your home. It could be a damaged line, a loose connection at the junction box, or something else the technician would need to physically inspect. I'm really sorry about this.

Customer: Yeah, I mean... I need this fixed today if possible. I have a meeting at 2 PM that I need internet for.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I do have a same-day appointment available. Would 12:30 PM work for you?

Customer: (pause) That's pretty soon. Yeah, that should work.

Agent: Perfect. I have a technician that can be at your address on Maple Street at 12:30 PM today. Can you make sure someone is home?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Great. The confirmation number is 789254. The technician will have an ID badge, and the appointment window is 12:30 to 2 PM. If they need to call you, they'll use the number on file. Does that all sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that's... yeah, thank you. I hope they can figure it out quickly.

Agent: I hope so too. I know this is frustrating. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying to fix it remotely anyway.

Agent: Of course. Thank you for being patient with me through all the troubleshooting. We'll get you back online. You have a great day, and again, the confirmation number is 789254.

Customer: Alright, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
