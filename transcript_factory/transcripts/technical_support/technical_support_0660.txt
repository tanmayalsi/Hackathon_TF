# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so my internet has been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here so we can figure out what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm looking at your account now. So the internet went down this morning, you said? Do you remember approximately what time that was?

Customer: Um, yeah, I'd say around 7 or so. I went to check my email and just... nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Okay, and are you getting any lights on your modem or router right now? Any indication that it's powering on?

Customer: (pause) Actually, yeah. The modem has a couple of lights on it. There's a green one and a red one blinking, I think? Or maybe it's orange. It's hard to tell in this lighting.

Agent: That's helpful. So if you look at your modem, there should be labels underneath the lights. Can you tell me which ones are lit up? Usually we have Power, Internet, and WiFi indicators.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause) So the Power one is solid green. The Internet one is... I think that's the red one that's blinking. And then the WiFi light appears to be off.

Agent: Alright, that definitely helps. The blinking red light on the Internet indicator typically means the modem isn't getting a signal from our network. Before we go further, have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in?

Customer: (slight laugh) You know, I actually haven't. I figured you'd probably ask me that, but I wasn't sure if it would help. Let me try that now.

Agent: Yeah, go ahead. Just unplug it from the power outlet, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: (background noise of rustling) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Thirty seconds... feels like longer than you think. (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) And... (pause) ...it's coming back on. The Power light is solid again. Still getting that red blink on the Internet though.

Agent: Okay, sometimes it takes a moment for it to reconnect. Let's give it another 30 seconds or so to see if that Internet light turns green. While we're waiting, let me just ask—have there been any storms in your area recently, or any recent construction or digging?

Customer: No storms that I know of. There was some work on the street last week, but I think they were just doing utility line stuff. I'm not sure if that's related.

Agent: It could be, actually. Sometimes when there's work being done on utility lines, it can affect service temporarily. (pause) Okay, how are we looking now? Did that Internet light change color?

Customer: (pause) Nope, still blinking red. Same as before.

Agent: Hmm, alright. Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at the connection status for your line, and actually... I'm showing that your modem isn't registering on our network at all right now. That's likely why we're not getting that Internet connection. Have you noticed any loose cables in the back of the modem where everything plugs in?

Customer: Let me look. (background noise) There's the power cable, the one going into the wall outlet for the internet, and then I have an ethernet cable going to my computer. Those all look pretty secure to me.

Agent: Good. The cable that goes into the wall outlet—that's actually the coax cable. That's the one that brings the internet into your modem. Can you check if that's screwed on tight? Sometimes if it's loose, it can cause a connection issue like this.

Customer: (pause) I'm checking it now... I think it's on pretty tight, but let me try unscrewing it a tiny bit and then screwing it back in to make sure it's seated properly.

Agent: Good idea, yeah.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, screwed it back in. Still... nothing. The light is still doing the same thing.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Let me try something here. I'm going to reboot your modem from our end. This might take a couple of minutes.

Customer: Alright, sure.

Agent: (typing sounds) And... sending the reboot command now. It can take a minute or two for this to process, so just keep an eye on those lights while we wait, okay?

Customer: (pause) Will do. (long pause) So... how long do you usually see something like this take?

Agent: Usually a couple of minutes. The modem should turn off completely for a few seconds and then power back up. We should start seeing some activity on those lights.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, something's happening now. All the lights just went off. (pause) And now the Power light came back on... okay, and the green light is back on the Internet indicator! Derek, I think it's working!

Agent: Oh great! That's a good sign. Let's see if it stays solid or if it goes back to blinking.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Okay, it's staying solid. Solid green. And now the WiFi light turned on too!

Agent: Excellent! That's exactly what we want to see. Let me just verify that you've got connectivity here. Can you open a web browser and try to load a website? Maybe Google or something simple.

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) Yeah, I'm opening Chrome right now. (pause) I'm going to go to Google... and... (pause) ...nothing's loading. It's still trying to connect, I think. Let me wait a second. (longer pause) Nope. The page is just spinning and... it's showing a "no connection" error now.

Agent: Hmm, that's strange. The modem seems to be connected to our network, but you're not getting internet access. Let me try rebooting the modem one more time. Sometimes it needs a full cycle.

Customer: Okay, go ahead.

Agent: (typing sounds) Rebooting now. Let's give this another minute or two.

Customer: (pause) The lights are going off again. (pause) Okay, they're back on. Power's green, Internet is... still blinking red again. We're back to square one.

Agent: I see that. (pause, typing sounds) Yeah, I'm still not seeing a valid connection to your modem on the network. This is unusual. And you said the technician was there last week for the utility work?

Customer: No, I mean, they were working on the street, but not specifically at my house or anything.

Agent: Right, right. (pause) Okay, so this is going to sound like a long shot, but let me ask—have you changed anything with your setup recently? New router, new ethernet cables, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. It's all been the same for like six months or so.

Agent: And this worked fine yesterday?

Customer: Yeah, yesterday morning I was browsing just fine. It was working perfectly.

Agent: (long pause, typing sounds) I'm pulling up some diagnostics here... (pause) ...and unfortunately, I'm getting an error code on your line that suggests there might be an issue with the connection point from our side—either at the pole or in the lines leading to your house. That would explain why the modem is connected to the router but not getting data through to our network.

Customer: Okay, so what does that mean?

Agent: It typically means we'd need to send a technician out to check the physical connection. Have you got any visible cable damage outside your house, anything hanging loose or anything that looks out of place?

Customer: (pause) I don't think so. Let me just look out the window real quick. (background noise, pause) I mean, everything looks normal to me. The cable runs up to the side of the house and then up to the box on the corner.

Agent: Okay. Well, what I'd like to do is get a technician scheduled to come out and check the line. They can look at everything from the street to your house and figure out exactly what's causing the issue. How does that sound?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, that's fine. But how long until someone can get out here? I really need my internet for work.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we've got available. (pause) Unfortunately, our next available appointment is actually tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. I know that's not ideal, but given that we're already into the afternoon, that's the earliest we have.

Customer: Tomorrow morning? That's... I guess that's okay, but I was hoping to get this resolved today.

Agent: I understand, and I really wish I could get someone out there sooner. The issue we're seeing would really require a technician to properly diagnose and fix it. There's not much more troubleshooting I can do from my end.

Customer: Yeah, I get it. (pause) Can you just confirm for me that the appointment is set up?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get all that information down. So we have the appointment scheduled for tomorrow, Monday, between 8 AM and noon. You'll receive a text message confirmation at the number on file, which I believe is 555-0147?

Customer: Actually, that's just the account number. My cell phone is 555-0892.

Agent: Oh, I apologize. Let me update that. (typing sounds) There we go. So you'll get a text at 555-0892 confirming the appointment. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that's it. I guess I'll just be without internet until tomorrow. This is pretty frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry we weren't able to resolve this today. But hopefully the technician tomorrow will be able to get you back up and running quickly. And just so you know, if you need to reach us before then, you can always call back.

Customer: Alright, thanks Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier, and sorry again about the service interruption. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
