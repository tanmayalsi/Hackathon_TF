Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Marcus. So my internet just went out completely about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll get this sorted out for you. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thanks. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Great, David. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Okay, I see you're on our fiber service in the Riverside area. So when you say the internet went out, are all the lights on your modem completely off, or are some of them still lighting up?

Customer: Um, let me check. (background noise) Okay, so the power light is on, it's that green one, but the internet light—I think it's the blue one?—that one is off. And it's been off the whole time.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So we're getting power to the modem, but no internet signal. Have you had any storms in your area recently, or any other issues before this happened?

Customer: No storms or anything. It was just working fine this morning, and then around noon I noticed everything was offline. I don't know what happened.

Agent: Alright, let's try a few things. First, I want you to unplug the modem—the device that's giving you the green light—and just leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I'll do that now. (background noise, rustling) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now go ahead and wait... let's say forty-five seconds to be safe. (pause) While you're waiting, are you on a desktop or laptop right now, or...?

Customer: I'm on my phone. I'm using my data to call you since my internet's out. (nervous laugh)

Agent: Right, of course. Okay, go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (background noise) Done. Plugging it back in... (pause) Okay, should I wait for it to boot back up?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Just give it about two minutes to fully boot. You'll know it's ready when that blue internet light comes back on and stays solid.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Alright, I'm watching it now. The green light came back... and I'm waiting for the blue one.

Agent: (pause) How's it looking?

Customer: It's... it's still not coming on. The blue light's still off.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds, longer pause) David, I'm looking at your modem signal here, and I'm not getting any connection from your equipment. Let me pull up your service area. (pause) This is interesting. Are you sure you haven't had any recent work done? Like, do you remember if a technician was out there recently?

Customer: No, nothing. I mean, not that I remember. My roommate might've had someone out, but he didn't tell me. Should I ask him?

Agent: That could definitely be it. Can you check with him really quick?

Customer: (pause, background noise, muffled conversation in background) Um, yeah, he said nobody's been here. He's been home all day.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Let me try another thing. Do you see the modem itself? Is there a reset button on the back?

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I see it. It's a little button, kind of recessed in there.

Agent: Perfect. So what I want you to do is hold that button down for about ten seconds. You might need a pen or something thin to reach it. This is going to reset the modem completely to factory settings, so just be aware of that.

Customer: Okay, I got a pen. (pause, background noise) I'm holding it down... ten seconds... (longer pause) Okay, let go.

Agent: Good. Now let's give it another two minutes to boot back up completely.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm waiting. (pause) The green light's back on again...

Agent: (pause) And the blue one?

Customer: No. Still nothing. It's been like thirty seconds. Maybe it needs more time?

Agent: Yeah, could be. Let's give it the full two minutes.

(long pause)

Customer: Okay, it's been a couple minutes now. The blue light... it's still off. I'm not seeing anything different.

Agent: (sigh, pause) Alright, David. I'm going to be honest with you here. I'm not seeing your modem connecting to our network at all, and a reset didn't bring it back. Let me just double-check something. (typing sounds, pause) Is there possibly a coaxial cable—it looks like a thick cable with metal ends—that could've come loose?

Customer: Let me look at the back... (background noise) Yeah, there's definitely cables back there. Is it the thicker one? Kind of silver-looking?

Agent: That's the one, yeah. Can you make sure that's plugged in all the way?

Customer: (background noise) Okay, yeah, I see it... it looks pretty plugged in, but let me try jiggling it a bit... (pause) Hmm, it's pretty tight actually.

Agent: Okay, well give it a slight wiggle and then push it back in firmly and see if that—

Customer: (interrupting, background noise) Wait, hold on. Oh! I think I felt it click in a little more. Let me... (pause, background noise) Okay, I pushed it back in. Can I check the modem again?

Agent: Go for it.

Customer: (pause, background noise) The lights are doing something different now. The green light went off for a second and... (longer pause) ...and the blue light came on! It's on!

Agent: Excellent! Okay, so now—

Customer: Wait, no. It just went back off. The blue light went back off.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Hmm. Let me check our system here again. (typing sounds, pause) David, I'm still not seeing anything on our end. And the fact that it flickered but didn't stay on tells me that there might be a signal issue coming from our infrastructure or possibly... it could be a hardware failure with your modem.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, do I need a new modem?

Agent: It could be. Or it could be something on our network side that we'd need to send a technician out to check on. I'd like to get you scheduled for a service visit so one of our techs can come out and diagnose this properly.

Customer: Yeah, okay. When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) I'm looking at our availability... the earliest I can get someone out there is tomorrow afternoon between two and four p.m. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean... (pause) Yeah, I guess that'll have to work.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, this is for the address on file at 447 Maple Street, Apartment 3B?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So to recap, we have a service appointment scheduled for tomorrow, [inaudible], between two and four p.m. A technician will come out and check both the modem and the line coming into your home. In the meantime, if you want to try anything else, you could try that reset one more time, but honestly I think we're looking at a hardware issue here.

Customer: Okay, yeah. I'll just wait for the technician. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, David. Sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone, but we'll have you back up and running tomorrow. Thanks for calling Frontier.

Customer: Thanks. Appreciate it.

Agent: Have a good day.
