Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just... it's completely down. Like, I can't get online at all, and I really need to figure this out because I'm supposed to be working from home today.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your phone number or account number, please?

Customer: Sure, it's... um... (pause) 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm seeing an account under the name... is this Michael Torres?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet isn't working at all right now. Have you tried power cycling your modem and router yet?

Customer: Power cycling? Like... unplugging them?

Agent: Exactly. Just unplug them both, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug them back in. That'll reset the connection.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (sound of movement) Yeah, I'm unplugging stuff now. (pause) Alright, they're both unplugged. I'm gonna wait.

Agent: Great. Take your time.

Customer: (after pause) Okay, plugging them back in now. So... how long does this usually take to come back up?

Agent: Usually just a couple of minutes. You should see the lights on the modem start blinking, and then they'll settle into a solid pattern once it's reconnected.

Customer: Uh... (pause) I'm looking at it. The lights are... well, they're kind of flickering but not really in a normal way. Like, it's just the red light, and it keeps going on and off.

Agent: Hmm, okay. The red light usually indicates there's a connection issue. Let me ask you a few questions. How long has this been going on?

Customer: Since this morning. I woke up and tried to check my email, and nothing. It was working fine last night.

Agent: Okay, and have there been any storms in your area recently? Or any power outages?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine. Power's been on the whole time.

Agent: Alright. Let me check the network on our end to see if there's anything happening in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any outages reported in your neighborhood. Can you tell me what you're seeing on the modem right now? Any lights at all besides the red one?

Customer: Just the red light. It's still blinking on and off.

Agent: And the router? Do you see any lights on that?

Customer: No, nothing. It's dark.

Agent: Okay, that's a bit unusual. The router should have some power indicator. Let me have you try something else. Can you check the cables? Make sure the ethernet cable from the modem to the wall is plugged in securely on both ends?

Customer: (sound of movement) Yeah, okay, I'm checking it. (pause) It's... it looks like it's in there, I guess.

Agent: Can you maybe unplug it completely and plug it back in? Just to make sure it's got a good connection.

Customer: Sure. (sound of unplugging) Plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Good. And the power cable on the modem itself—can you make sure that's secure too?

Customer: (checking) Yeah, it looks fine. Still just that red light, though.

Agent: Alright. I'm thinking we might be looking at a modem issue. Let me check what model you have on file here. (typing) It looks like you've got a Frontier-provided modem, model FX-2000. Is that what you're looking at?

Customer: Um, let me see... yeah, I think so. It says FX-something on it.

Agent: Perfect. So here's what I'd like to try. Can you hold the reset button—it's usually on the back—for about 10 seconds? That'll factory reset the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. Holding it now. (pause) How long?

Agent: About 10 more seconds should do it. Just keep it held.

Customer: (pause) Okay, letting go. (pause) Nothing's really happening. It's still the same red light.

Agent: Okay, let me ask you this—when was the last time you actually saw your internet working normally?

Customer: Last night, like around 10 PM. I was streaming Netflix, no problems at all.

Agent: Got it. And nothing happened between then and now? No power issues, nothing?

Customer: No, nothing that I noticed. Like I said, I just woke up and it was down.

Agent: (pause) You know what, I'm wondering if this might be a modem hardware failure. The fact that it's stuck on that red light even after the reset is a pretty good indicator. Let me check if we can send you a replacement. (typing sounds) Unfortunately, our next available tech visit would be... (pause) ...not until Thursday. But I can absolutely overnight you a replacement modem if you'd like to try that route instead.

Customer: Overnight? Like, tomorrow?

Agent: Yes, we can have it to you by tomorrow afternoon. You'd just need to unplug the old one and hook up the new one—it's really just a plug-and-play situation.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I mean, if it'll get me back online, let's do that. But what am I supposed to do in the meantime? I really need internet today for work.

Agent: (pause) I understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, without being able to get the connection working on this end, we're looking at either the replacement modem tomorrow or... [inaudible] ...the Thursday tech visit.

Customer: Can't you guys send someone sooner? Like, today?

Agent: Let me check that for you. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any same-day availability in your area, unfortunately. I really wish I could get you in sooner. Is the Thursday appointment completely not workable for you?

Customer: Thursday? That's like, three days away. I need to work. Can I even do anything else?

Agent: Well, the overnight modem is probably your best bet. Or... if you have a mobile hotspot you could use for today and tomorrow, that might help bridge the gap while we wait for the new modem to arrive.

Customer: I mean, I guess I have some mobile data, but my plan isn't that big. This is frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand, and I really apologize. Let me tell you what—I'm going to go ahead and set up that overnight modem for you at no charge for the shipping, and I'm also going to add a month of service credit to your account for this issue. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) I mean... I guess that's something. Yeah, okay. Let's do it.

Agent: Excellent. I'm processing that now. (typing sounds) Alright, so you should receive the modem tomorrow. When it arrives, just unplug the current one, unplug the power, and then hook up the new one the same way. It should be plug-and-play. And you have any trouble, you can always call us back.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything I should try in the meantime? Just... I don't know... to see if I can get it working today?

Agent: (pause) Well, we've tried the power cycle, the reset... Let me think here. (pause) You could try one more thing—make sure all the coaxial cables are tight. That's the kind of thick cable that screws onto the modem from the wall. Sometimes if that's loose, you'll get that red light.

Customer: (sound of movement) Okay, let me check. (pause) It's pretty tight, but let me try unscrewing it and screwing it back in. (pause) Okay, I'm doing that now. (pause) [inaudible] ...it's... (pause) Nope, still the same thing.

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately, I think we're looking at a hardware issue with that modem. The overnight replacement is definitely your best option.

Customer: Alright. Well, I guess I'll just use my mobile data for now and wait for the new modem tomorrow.

Agent: That sounds like a good plan. And again, I really apologize for this. You should be all set once that replacement arrives. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully this fixes it.

Agent: I'm confident it will. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your patience. Have a great day.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
