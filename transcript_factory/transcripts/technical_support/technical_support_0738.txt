Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. My internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get your name?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Great, James. I've got you here. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. When exactly did you first notice it wasn't working?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 7:30 this morning. I tried to check my email and nothing was loading. I restarted my router already, by the way. That didn't help.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting step. So the router is powered back on now?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. The lights are on and everything, but I'm still not getting anything. It's just not connecting.

Agent: Alright. Let me just verify what I'm seeing here. You have our Fiber 200 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. I think so, anyway.

Agent: Perfect. So what I'm going to do is run a quick line test from my end to see if we're getting a signal to your equipment. Just give me one moment. (pause) (typing sounds)

Customer: Okay.

Agent: And while that's running, I want to make sure—are all the cables connected properly? Like, the fiber line coming into your home and then into the modem?

Customer: Uh... let me look. (pause) Yeah, I see the cable coming in from outside. It's plugged into the modem. It looks fine to me.

Agent: Great. And is there an outlet on the back of the modem where the router connects? Do you see that?

Customer: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see it. That's plugged in too.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, the modem itself—do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Yeah, there's... there's definitely lights on. Let me see here. There's like a green light and... a red light? Or maybe it's orange. It's hard to tell.

Agent: Okay. Can you describe where those lights are located? Are they on the front of the modem?

Customer: Yeah, right on the front. The green one is on the left, and then the orange or red one is more in the middle.

Agent: Got it. And is there any light that indicates an internet connection? That might say "Internet" or "Online" next to it?

Customer: (pause) Hmm, I'm not seeing one that specifically says that, no. Most of the indicators are kind of dim or off, actually, now that I'm looking closer.

Agent: Okay, that might be part of the issue. Those lights should be lit up if everything's connected properly. Let me... okay, so my line test here is showing that we are getting a signal to your location. So the issue isn't on our end necessarily. Let's try a few more things. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull it from the power outlet.

Customer: Sure. (pause) Done.

Agent: Great. Now let's leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. I'm going to count it down for you. (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: Plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: And let's just give it a minute to fully boot up. Those lights should start lighting up as it does.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's... yeah, I'm seeing some activity now. There's more lights on than before.

Agent: Excellent. How many lights would you say are lit up now?

Customer: I count... four? Maybe five. But that red or orange one is still there. Or wait, is it amber? I don't know.

Agent: That could actually be normal, depending on which light that is. Let me ask you—do you have any connection now? Can you maybe try opening a web browser on your computer or phone?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me try... (longer pause) No, it's... it's still not working. It's still not connecting to the internet.

Agent: Hmm, alright. Let's try one more restart, but this time we'll do what's called a factory reset on the modem. This will take a bit longer to boot back up, but hopefully it'll clear out any configuration issues. There should be a small reset button on the modem. It might be recessed. Do you see that?

Customer: Reset button... (pause) I'm looking but I don't see anything obvious.

Agent: It might be really small. You might need a paperclip or a pen to press it.

Customer: (pause) Oh, wait. Yeah, I think I see it. It's like a tiny hole on the back?

Agent: That's probably it. Can you grab something small to press that?

Customer: Hang on. (pause) Okay, I got a pen. (pause) Pushing it in... (pause) Okay, I held it for like five seconds. Did that work?

Agent: Good. Now the modem is going to reboot. This might take a few minutes. While we wait, let me check some other things on my end. (typing sounds)

Customer: (long pause) How much longer, do you think?

Agent: Usually around three to five minutes for a full reset. We're getting close. Just give it another minute or so.

Customer: (pause) Okay... it's been a few minutes now. Still no internet. The lights are back on, but same as before.

Agent: (pause) I'm seeing that the signal is still coming to your location. Let me... (pause) Did you happen to see any alerts or letters from us recently about maintenance in your area?

Customer: No, I don't think so. Nothing that I can remember, anyway.

Agent: Okay. (typing sounds) (pause) Well, I'm not showing any active maintenance. But what I am seeing is that while the signal is reaching your modem, the modem doesn't appear to be synchronizing with our network properly.

Customer: What does that mean? Is that like... a hardware issue?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be that the modem itself has gone bad, or there could be an issue with the fiber line coming into your home. What we might need to do is get a technician out to your location to do a more thorough check on the physical equipment and the line.

Customer: Oh. (pause) How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) So it looks like we have appointments available... we could get someone out to you tomorrow between 2 and 5 PM, or the day after tomorrow in the morning.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be better for me.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to schedule a technician to come out tomorrow, between 2 and 5 PM. Is that address still 447 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, when the technician arrives, they'll take a look at the modem, the fiber line, everything. Is there anything else I should make a note of here?

Customer: Um, no, I think that covers it. How much is that going to cost me?

Agent: So this is going to be a standard service call. If it turns out to be a hardware issue with the modem, we can replace that for you. If it's a line issue on our end, there would be no charge. The technician will know more once they get there.

Customer: Okay, that sounds fair.

Agent: Perfect. So to recap, you've got a technician coming tomorrow between 2 and 5 PM. You'll receive a confirmation email and also a courtesy call about an hour before they arrive. Is there a contact number where we can reach you?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147, same as the account.

Agent: Perfect. And James, I really apologize you're experiencing this. I know it's incredibly frustrating. Unfortunately, with what we're seeing on our end, a technician visit is going to be the best way to diagnose this. We should be able to get you back up and running tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate it. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Great. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, James. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
