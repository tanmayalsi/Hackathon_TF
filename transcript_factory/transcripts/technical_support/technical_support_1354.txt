# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I have to finish some work for my job today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'll definitely help you get this sorted out. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And what's the best name to have on file here?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Let me pull up your account real quick. (pause) Alright, I've got you here. So you're saying your internet is completely down as of this morning?

Customer: Yeah, it went out around eight o'clock, I think. I was just working and then... nothing. The connection just dropped and hasn't come back.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let's troubleshoot this together. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is your modem powered on?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's on. I can see the lights on the front. They're... hmm, actually some of them are blinking red.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Which lights are showing red?

Customer: Um, there's the power light which looks normal, but the internet light is definitely red and blinking.

Agent: That red blinking light typically indicates a connection issue between your modem and our network. Let's try a simple restart. Can you unplug the modem for me right now?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While that's unplugged, can you also unplug your router if you have a separate one?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I do have one. (unplugging sounds) Okay, both are unplugged now.

Agent: Perfect. Let's wait about thirty seconds while those are powered down. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Done.

Agent: And now the router.

Customer: (pause) Okay. (typing sounds in background) Oh, now I see some different lights. There's a blue light now.

Agent: Good, that's a step in the right direction. That blue light means the modem is searching for a signal. Can you wait about two to three minutes and let me know if that blue light turns to solid green?

Customer: Sure, I can wait. (pause) Um, how long do you think this will take?

Agent: Usually the whole process takes about five minutes or so. Is that okay for you?

Customer: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm working from home today so I don't have anywhere to be. I just... I really need this working.

Agent: Absolutely, I hear you. (pause) How's that light looking now?

Customer: Still blue and blinking.

Agent: Okay, still searching. Let's give it another minute. (pause) Has anything unusual happened recently? Any storms, power outages, or changes to your setup?

Customer: (pause) Well, actually, we did have some heavy rain last night. Could that have something to do with it?

Agent: It's definitely possible. Weather can sometimes affect the connection. Can you check your modem and router for any visible damage? Water intrusion, anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Um, no, they look fine. They're both dry and everything seems normal physically.

Agent: Okay, good. And the cables are all plugged in securely?

Customer: Yeah, I'm checking now. The power cable is in, and the... uh, the cable from the wall to the modem is in too. Looks secure.

Agent: Alright, how's that internet light now?

Customer: (pause) It's... it's still blinking blue. Maybe slightly different, but still not green.

Agent: Let me try something else. Can you access the modem's web interface? You should be able to go to 192.168.0.1 in your web browser.

Customer: Okay, um... (keyboard sounds) Let me open a browser. (pause) Actually, I can't get online obviously, so I can't really navigate to anything. My computer's not connecting to anything.

Agent: Right, right, that's... that makes sense. I'm sorry, that was [inaudible]. Let me look at this from our end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me the model number on your modem? It should be on the front or back.

Customer: (pause) It says... Frontier Quantum Gateway. That's all it says on there.

Agent: Okay, yes, that's a good modem. Let me pull up your service line here. (pause, longer pause) Hmm, David, I'm not showing your modem coming online on our network at all, which is unusual.

Customer: Oh no. What does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It could be a line issue or possibly an equipment failure. Let me check your connection status in the system... (pause) I'm showing that our line comes active around 10 AM, but then it drops off intermittently. Have you noticed any flickering or anything since it came back briefly?

Customer: No, actually, I just saw it go down once this morning and that's been it.

Agent: Understood. Let me have you try one more thing. Do you see a small reset button on the modem? Usually, it's kind of recessed on the back.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I do see a little button. Do you want me to press it?

Agent: Actually, wait before you do that. If you press that, it will reset all your modem settings back to factory default. We can do that, but I want to let you know it means we'd have to reconfigure everything. Are you comfortable with that?

Customer: Um... I guess so? If it'll help. I don't really have any special settings I don't think.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and hold that for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Holding it... (longer pause) Okay, let go.

Agent: (pause) Good. Now let's wait and see if that changes anything. (pause) How's the light looking?

Customer: It's... it's going through different colors now. I'm seeing like orange and white... now it's turning green? Maybe? (pause) No, it's back to blue. Um, this is... this is kind of frustrating.

Agent: I know, I appreciate your patience with me here. (pause) This is unusual behavior. Let me try to get a senior technician on the line to take a deeper look at this because—

Customer: Wait, so you're saying you can't fix it?

Agent: Not yet, but I want to make sure we exhaust all options. It could be an issue on our network side that I'm not able to fully diagnose from here. (pause) Actually, let me check one more time... (typing sounds, longer pause) You know what, I'm going to have you try something. Can you try connecting your computer directly to the modem with an ethernet cable instead of Wi-Fi?

Customer: Oh, um, I don't think I have an ethernet cable. I usually just use Wi-Fi.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Do you have any other devices you could try connecting to? A phone or tablet, just to see if the Wi-Fi is broadcasting?

Customer: (pause) Let me grab my phone. (pause) Okay, I'm looking for networks... (pause) No, I don't see any Frontier network showing up at all. Nothing.

Agent: Alright, that tells me the router isn't getting a signal from the modem to broadcast. And I'm going to be honest with you, David, this is pointing to either a modem equipment failure or a line-level issue that I'm not able to resolve remotely.

Customer: (pause) So what does that mean? How long is this going to take to fix?

Agent: Well, we have two options. I can schedule a technician to come out to your location to diagnose this in person. That would probably give us the best chance of figuring out exactly what's going on. Or, we could try sending a replacement modem to you, but that would take a few business days to arrive.

Customer: How soon could a technician come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability... (typing sounds) I'm showing we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or Thursday afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better for me, actually. Can you put me down for that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get some information from you. What's the best phone number to reach you at?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Perfect, and is that a cell phone or a home number?

Customer: It's my cell.

Agent: Okay great. (typing sounds) Alright David, I have you scheduled for tomorrow, December 14th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. A technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive. Is there anything else you need from me today?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that's everything. But, um, is there any chance this gets fixed before then? Like, I don't know, if I try something else?

Agent: Unfortunately, I've run through all the remote troubleshooting steps I can do. It really does seem to be a hardware or line issue that needs hands-on attention. I wish I had better news for you.

Customer: Alright, well, thank you for trying at least.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved today, but we'll definitely take care of you tomorrow. Your confirmation number is 847923 if you need to reference this call. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, David. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
