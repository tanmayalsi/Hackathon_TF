Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I work from home and this is, like, pretty urgent.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing your account here. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning? When exactly did you first notice it wasn't working?

Customer: Uh, around 8 AM, I think? I went to check my email and nothing was loading. I waited like 20 minutes thinking maybe it was just a glitch, but it's been out all day.

Agent: Okay, and have you noticed any lights on your modem or router? Are they lit up at all?

Customer: Yeah, so that's the thing. The modem has... like, the power light is on, but everything else is dark. Usually there's like a blue light that blinks and it's not doing that.

Agent: Got it. So the power light is on but no activity lights. That's helpful. Let me check if there are any outages in your area. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end. So let's try to get this working. Have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in?

Customer: Uh, yeah actually. I did that earlier. I unplugged it for like 30 seconds and plugged it back in, but nothing changed.

Agent: Okay, that's good that you tried that. Um, and you're still just seeing that power light and nothing else?

Customer: Right. All the other lights are just completely off.

Agent: Alright. Let me have you do that one more time, but this time we'll wait a full two minutes. Sometimes it takes a little longer to boot back up. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Sure, yeah. I'll do it now. (rustling sounds) Okay, unplugging it.

Agent: Great. And we'll just give it... two full minutes. So just... take your time there.

Customer: Okay. (pause) (pause) So while we're waiting, is this something that's like... a known issue or...?

Agent: Not that I'm aware of. Usually when we see the power light on but no activity lights, it's either a connection issue or possibly the modem needs to be replaced. But let's see if this reboot helps first.

Customer: Yeah, that makes sense.

Agent: (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (rustling) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) I'm watching it... nothing's happening yet.

Agent: It might take 30 seconds or so to boot up. Just keep watching it.

Customer: (pause) Nope. Still just the power light. That's... that's weird.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me check something. Do you have a second phone or maybe a tablet you could use real quick? I want to see if you're getting a WiFi signal at all.

Customer: Oh, good idea. Let me grab my phone. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the WiFi networks available... and I don't see my Frontier network at all. Nothing.

Agent: Alright, so no WiFi signal either. That tells me the modem isn't connecting properly. Let me ask you this—is there a coaxial cable? It's like a thick cable, kind of silvery-looking, that connects to the back of the modem?

Customer: Yeah, yeah I see it. It's plugged in back there.

Agent: Okay, can you just check and make sure that's nice and snug? Sometimes these can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) (rustling sounds) Okay, I'm checking... it seems pretty tight. I mean, I can try tightening it more if you want.

Agent: Go ahead and give it a gentle tighten, just clockwise.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm tightening it. Hmm... okay, it's tighter now. (pause) Still nothing though.

Agent: Alright. Um, is there possibly a battery backup unit connected to your modem? Sometimes we have those for phone service.

Customer: Uh, I think so? There's like a box underneath the modem. Is that it?

Agent: Yeah, that could be it. That's usually black and kind of rectangular?

Customer: Yeah, exactly.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and unplug that as well and then plug it back in. Let's just make sure everything's cycling.

Customer: (pause) (rustling) Unplugging... now plugging back in. (pause) Okay. (pause) Hmm, I'm not seeing any change here.

Agent: (sigh) Alright, I appreciate your patience here. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at your modem's signal strength from our network, and it's... it's actually showing as offline on our end too, which means we're not getting a connection from your equipment at all.

Customer: So is that the modem? Like, is that bad?

Agent: It could be. It's looking like that's probably what's going on. When modems stop communicating with our network and the activity lights go out, it's usually a sign that the modem itself is having an issue. I'm going to be honest with you—it might need to be replaced.

Customer: [inaudible] ...great. So what do I do?

Agent: Well, I have a couple options for you. I can schedule a technician to come out, and they can assess it in person. Or, if you'd like, we can have a replacement modem sent out to you, but that would take a few business days. Given that you work from home and you need this urgently, I'd actually recommend the technician visit.

Customer: How soon could they come out?

Agent: Let me check availability... (typing sounds) (pause) I'm looking at today and tomorrow... It looks like we have an opening tomorrow morning between 8 AM and 10 AM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? Yeah, I guess that's... that's not ideal, but I don't have a choice, do I?

Agent: I understand, and I'm sorry about that. Unfortunately, our next availability after that isn't until Thursday. But actually, wait—let me check something. (pause) (typing sounds) Actually, we might be able to get someone out later this evening. Like, around 5 PM to 7 PM. Does that work?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, actually that's better. Yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Awesome. So I'm gonna get that scheduled for you today between 5 and 7 PM. The technician will bring a replacement modem and get you back up and running. Can you confirm your service address for me?

Customer: 1247 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing) 1247 Maple Drive, 3B. Perfect. And a phone number they can reach you at if they need to?

Customer: It's 555-0198.

Agent: Great. Got it. So to recap—we have a technician scheduled for today between 5 and 7 PM. They'll bring a modem and get everything set up. Your confirmation number is 4892-FR. I'm going to send that to the email on your account as well.

Customer: Okay, great. So they'll just... they'll replace it and it should work?

Agent: That's the plan, yeah. They'll replace the modem and make sure everything's connected properly. If for some reason there's something else going on, they'll troubleshoot that too.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate it. Sorry for the long conversation.

Agent: No, no, don't apologize at all. That's what I'm here for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just hoping this gets fixed soon.

Agent: I understand. We really appreciate your patience, and we're sorry for the inconvenience. You should have someone out there this evening. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and have a great day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
