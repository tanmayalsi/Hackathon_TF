Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Can you tell me a little more about what's happening? Are you seeing any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Um, yeah, so the modem has some lights on it. I think... there's like a white light and a red light blinking. The router is also on, but I'm not getting any connection to anything.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. The red light typically indicates an issue with the connection. Have you tried unplugging the modem and router and plugging them back in yet?

Customer: Yeah, I did that like an hour ago. Nothing changed. I waited a good five minutes before I plugged it back in, too, so...

Agent: Good, you did that correctly. Alright, let's try a couple more things. Can you check the cable that goes from the wall into the modem? Just make sure it's firmly connected on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I'm looking at it now. It seems pretty tight, but let me... let me just wiggle it a bit to make sure. (pause) No, it feels secure.

Agent: Alright. And what about the power cable to the modem?

Customer: That's definitely plugged in. The modem's got power.

Agent: Right. Okay, David, I'm going to check a few things on our end really quick. (typing sounds) Let me see what our system is showing... (longer pause) Hmm, okay. I'm seeing that your modem is connected to our network, which is good news. But it looks like... there might be an issue with the signal we're receiving from your location.

Customer: What does that mean exactly?

Agent: It could mean a few things. There might be a problem with the line coming into your house, or there could be an issue with the equipment at our end. But before we go down that road, let me have you try one more thing. Can you restart the modem for me? I need you to hold down the reset button on the back for about ten seconds.

Customer: Wait, the reset button? Won't that like... erase everything?

Agent: No, no, it won't erase anything. It'll just restart the modem and have it reconnect to the network. It's different than a factory reset.

Customer: Okay, okay. (pause) Alright, I found the button. Holding it down now... (pause) Okay, it's restarting. I can see the lights are going through their startup sequence.

Agent: Perfect. Give it about two minutes to fully boot back up and reconnect.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been a couple minutes now. Still got the red light blinking though. And I'm trying to connect to the Wi-Fi and... nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay. Let me check something here. (pause) David, I'm not seeing any issues on our network side right now that would explain this. But I do want to rule out a problem with your router. Can you try connecting to the modem directly with an ethernet cable? Do you have one of those handy?

Customer: Uh, I might have one somewhere. Let me check. (pause) Yeah, I found one. Okay, plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, I'm connected.

Agent: Great. Do you have any internet connection now?

Customer: (pause) No. No, nothing. That's... that's weird, right?

Agent: It is unusual, yeah. That tells me the issue is likely on the modem side or potentially with the line coming into your home. (pause) I'm going to be honest with you, David—this is beyond what I can troubleshoot over the phone. I think we need to get a technician out to your location to look at the physical line and the equipment.

Customer: How long before someone can come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... (pause) I can get someone out there tomorrow between 12 PM and 4 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... I really need this working today if possible.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see if there's any same-day availability. (pause) Unfortunately, our technicians are fully booked for today in your area. Tomorrow is the earliest we can get someone out.

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, okay. I guess that'll have to work. Do I need to do anything before they get there?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home during that window. The technician will need access to your modem and the outside of your house. They may need to check the line connection or potentially replace the modem. In the meantime, keep the modem plugged in and powered on so we can continue to monitor it from here.

Customer: Alright, I will. Is there anything else I should try?

Agent: I wouldn't recommend trying anything else at this point, to be honest. We don't want to accidentally make things worse. The technician will be able to diagnose what's going on properly. I'm going to make a note on your account about the red light and the signal issue, so they'll have that information when they arrive.

Customer: Okay. I appreciate that. Is there a phone number I should have in case something changes or... or if I need to reschedule?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, when you get your appointment confirmation, it'll have a number on there you can call. But you can also always call us back at the main number, which is 1-800-FRONTIER, and reference your account.

Customer: Okay, got it. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, David. I apologize again that we couldn't get this resolved today, but I'm confident our technician will take care of you tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help with?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for trying.

Agent: Have a good day, David, and we'll get you back online soon.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
