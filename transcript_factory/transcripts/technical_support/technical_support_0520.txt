# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just completely stopped working about an hour ago. I've got nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. Or you can look it up under James Mitchell.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, James, I'm pulling up your account here... Got it. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan in the Phoenix area. When did you first notice the internet went down?

Customer: Like I said, about an hour ago. I was just browsing and everything froze. Then I looked at my router and the lights were all... I don't know, they weren't blinking normally.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your modem and router right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) The modem has like a red light on it. It's solid red. And the router, I think it's just... it's dark? Or maybe there's a tiny light but I can't really tell.

Agent: Okay, so the modem is showing red, which typically means no connection. First thing I'd like you to do is power cycle the equipment. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now, if there's a battery backup on the modem, you might see some lights flash. We're just gonna wait about 30 seconds, and then we'll plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay... it's been about 30 seconds. Plugging it back in now.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. Give it about another 30 seconds to boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me if you've experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. We've had really good service up until now. That's why we switched to Frontier in the first place.

Agent: I appreciate that. We value your business. Alright, what's the modem showing now?

Customer: (pause) Um... the red light is still there. It's still solid red. Nothing's changed, really.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Let me see if there's an issue with your line. Do you have any other devices that might be connected to the modem right now? Like a computer or—

Customer: Just my phone and my laptop. Both of them say no internet connection.

Agent: Right. (pause) James, I'm not seeing any service issues reported in your area, so this might be equipment-specific. Let me have you try something else. Do you see any cables connected to the back of the modem?

Customer: Yeah, there's... there's like two cables. One comes from the wall and one goes to the router.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, can you unplug both of those cables from the modem?

Customer: Both? (pause) Okay... unplugged.

Agent: Now, I want you to wait about 10 seconds, and then plug the cable coming from the wall back into the modem. Don't plug in the router connection yet.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Let's give it another 20 seconds or so to establish connection with just that one cable. (pause) What's happening now?

Customer: Still red. Same thing.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm. Okay, let me check something here. Is the modem warm to the touch, or does it feel normal?

Customer: It's... yeah, it feels pretty warm actually. Is that bad?

Agent: (pause) It could be. How warm are we talking? Like, can you comfortably hold your hand on it?

Customer: I mean... not really. It's pretty hot.

Agent: Okay, that's a bit concerning. That might indicate a hardware issue with the modem itself. When did you first get this modem? Do you know how long you've had it?

Customer: Um, probably like two years? Maybe a little longer. It's been working great though.

Agent: Right. (pause) James, I think what we're looking at here might be a failed modem. The persistent red light combined with the overheating is pointing to that. Let me try one more thing before we move forward. Can you try a different power outlet? Just to rule out any issues with that particular outlet?

Customer: Oh, sure. Let me... (pause) Okay, I'm moving it to the kitchen outlet. Plugging it in... (pause) Still red. Same thing.

Agent: (pause) Alright. (typing sounds) I've done what I can on the troubleshooting end, and unfortunately, I think the modem has failed. This isn't something we can fix over the phone. We're going to need to get you a replacement unit.

Customer: Oh man, really? How long is that gonna take? I work from home, and I really need internet.

Agent: I understand completely. Let me look at our options here. (typing sounds) (pause) So, we can send you a replacement modem, and depending on your location, we can get it to you within 2 to 3 business days if we ship it standard. However, if you want it faster, we do have expedited shipping available.

Customer: 2 to 3 days? That's... can't you guys do anything faster? Like same-day or something?

Agent: (pause) I wish I could help with same-day, but our fastest standard option is really the expedited shipping, which would get it to you by next business day. However, if you're in a service area where we have a physical location, you could potentially pick one up in person.

Customer: Which locations do those... I don't know Phoenix that well.

Agent: Let me see here... (typing sounds) Unfortunately, our nearest retail location to you would be about 45 minutes away in Scottsdale. I can provide you with that address if you'd like, but I want to be realistic with you—we don't always have modems in stock at all locations.

Customer: This is really frustrating. I mean, I can't work without internet. Is there anything else you can do?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I really am sorry you're going through this. (pause) What I can do is prioritize your replacement shipment and add a note to get you expedited shipping at no charge given the circumstances. That should have it to you by tomorrow afternoon.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, that would help. Thank you.

Agent: Of course. Let me get that set up for you right now. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, James, I've initiated a replacement modem shipment with expedited delivery at no charge. You should receive a tracking number via email within the next two hours. The modem should arrive by tomorrow by 5 PM.

Customer: Okay. And once I get it, I just... plug it in and it should work?

Agent: Yes, exactly. It should be plug-and-play. You'll connect the cable from the wall, just like you have now, and it should boot up. Give it about five minutes and your internet should be back online. If you run into any issues when you receive it, feel free to call us back.

Customer: Alright. Well, I appreciate your help, even though we couldn't fix it right now.

Agent: I'm genuinely sorry we couldn't resolve this today. Is there anything else I can help you with while I have you on the line?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully this new modem gets here and works.

Agent: I'm confident it will. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, James, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a great day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
