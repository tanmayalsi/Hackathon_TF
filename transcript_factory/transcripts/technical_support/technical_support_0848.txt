Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got a meeting in like twenty minutes and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I'm showing this is under... Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember approximately what time?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I'd say around 8 o'clock or so. I tried to check email and nothing was loading. I restarted my router, I unplugged it for like thirty seconds, plugged it back in... nothing worked.

Agent: Okay, okay. Well, that's a good first step that you already did that. Let me ask you a few questions here. When you look at your router right now, are there any lights on it at all?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, actually, there's... there's a light that's blinking red. Is that bad?

Agent: That red light typically indicates either a connection issue or potentially a problem with the modem itself. Um, which model router do we have you set up with?

Customer: I... I'm not totally sure. It's the one that came with my fiber installation like three years ago?

Agent: Right, that's helpful. Do you see any model numbers or stickers on the device?

Customer: (background noise of fumbling) Okay, I'm looking at it now. It says... Frontier branded, and it says... FXC-4000?

Agent: Perfect, thank you. Okay, so here's what I want you to do. I want you to unplug the modem—not the router, the modem. It should be a separate device, usually a little bit smaller and rectangular. Do you see that?

Customer: Oh, um, is it the black box with all the cables?

Agent: Yes, that's it. Okay, go ahead and unplug that from the power source.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait for about 60 seconds before you plug it back in. I'm gonna check on a few things on my end while you're doing that.

Customer: Okay... (long pause) ...still waiting.

Agent: Take your time. While you're waiting, do you know if there have been any recent storms in your area or any construction happening nearby?

Customer: (pause) No storms that I know of. There's... there's actually some road work on my street, but they've been doing that for a couple weeks now.

Agent: Okay, that's good information. Those things sometimes can affect the lines. Go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in. (pause) There's a light... okay, it's doing that thing where it's blinking and... it looks like it might be coming back on?

Agent: Good, good. Give it about two minutes to fully boot up. While that's happening, can you grab a computer or a phone that might connect wirelessly and just keep an eye on whether you see your network name pop up in the available networks?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my laptop right here. (pause) Um, I'm looking at the WiFi networks and... yeah, my network name is showing up. That's a good sign, right?

Agent: Excellent, that is a good sign. Go ahead and try to connect to it if you're not already connected.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm connecting now... it says connected but no internet. (frustrated sigh) Of course.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's... that's interesting. So you're connected to the WiFi but not getting internet access. Let me look at this from our end. (typing sounds) Okay, Robert, I'm seeing that your account is active and your service should be provisioned...

(pause)

Agent: ...but I'm not seeing any recent activity on the line. That tells me either there's a break in the connection between our network and your home, or there's an issue with the modem itself. Have you checked to see if all the cables are plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me look... (background noise) The cables look like they're plugged in pretty tight. I don't know, they seem fine.

Agent: Okay. Um, can you describe to me what cables you're seeing? Is there like a thick coaxial cable, kind of looks like a TV cable?

Customer: Oh, yeah, there's definitely one of those. That's plugged in. And there's ethernet cables. And then there's the power.

Agent: Alright, so here's what I'd like to try. The cable that goes from your modem into the wall—that coax cable I mentioned—can you unplug that from the modem, just for a second, and look at the connector on both ends? Just make sure there's no dirt or damage on it.

Customer: (pause, fumbling sounds) Okay... looking at it now. Uh... the end that plugs into the modem looks fine. The other end, the one that goes into the wall, is also... I mean, it looks okay to me.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug that back in and make sure it's snug.

Customer: (pause) Done. Okay, so... still nothing though. Should I try restarting everything again?

Agent: Actually, let's try a different approach. I'm going to remotely reset your modem from my system. This might take a minute or two. Just leave everything plugged in and powered on, okay?

Customer: Okay, sounds good. (pause) How long do you think this will take?

Agent: Should be just a moment. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I've initiated the reset. This should reboot the modem. You might see the lights go out and come back on. Just give it another two to three minutes to fully come back online.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see the lights are going out. (pause) Yep, coming back on now. (pause) I'm... I'm watching it and it looks like it's booting back up. The red light is back though.

Agent: That red light's back?

Customer: Yeah, it's blinking red again.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's... that's concerning. Robert, I'm going to be honest with you. That red light typically means we're not getting a signal from our end to your modem. That could mean a few different things. It could be an issue with the modem itself, or there could be a line issue between here and your house.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, how do I fix that?

Agent: Well, unfortunately, the troubleshooting we can do over the phone is pretty limited at this point. What I would recommend is we get a technician out to your address to do a more thorough check of the line and potentially replace the modem if that's where the issue is.

Customer: (frustrated) A technician? How long would that take? I really need internet for work today.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check what our availability is looking like. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so our next available appointment for a technician visit is actually tomorrow between 2 and 4 PM. I know that's not ideal for today, but that's what I'm seeing.

Customer: Tomorrow? (pause) Okay, I... I guess I'll have to figure something out. Can I... can I do the appointment tomorrow?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) So tomorrow, September 15th, between 2 and 4 PM. Is that address 447 Maple Street still current?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. I've got you all set for tomorrow. A technician will come out and they'll do a full diagnostic and take it from there. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess... I guess that's it. This is really frustrating though. I've got an important call I need to get on.

Agent: I hear you, and I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved for you today. I wish I could do more over the phone. But our technician tomorrow should be able to identify exactly what's going on. If you have any other issues, you can always call us back at the number on your bill.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, Robert. We appreciate your patience, and again, sorry for the inconvenience. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's everything.

Agent: Alright, have a good day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
