# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet just went out completely. It's been down for like the past hour and I don't know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I'm showing an account for... is this Michael Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. So your internet has been down for about an hour you said?

Customer: Yeah, roughly. Maybe a little longer. I tried restarting the modem and router already, but nothing's happening. The modem just keeps blinking red.

Agent: Okay, okay. A red light on the modem—that typically means there's no connection coming in from our network. Let me ask you a few quick questions. First, do you see any lights on the modem at all right now?

Customer: Yeah, there's like a red light on the power indicator and then... it looks like the internet light is also red. Everything else is kind of dark.

Agent: Got it. And just to confirm, when you say you restarted it—did you unplug the modem completely?

Customer: Um, I unplugged the modem, yeah. I left it off for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in.

Agent: Alright, that's good. Let me check if there are any service issues in your area. (pause) (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported in your neighborhood at the moment. Where are you located? Just the city and zip code is fine.

Customer: I'm in Denver, 80202.

Agent: Okay, 80202. Yeah, no active incidents showing for that area. So what we're looking at here is likely an issue with either your modem or the line coming into your home. Let me try a couple more things with you, if that's alright?

Customer: Yeah, sure. Whatever you can do.

Agent: Great. So can you go back to the modem for me? I want you to check all the cables going into it. Make sure the coaxial cable—that's the thicker one, usually has a silver connector—is screwed in nice and tight on both ends.

Customer: (background noise of movement) Okay, I'm looking at it now. Um, let me check... the one going into the wall looks pretty tight, and the one on the modem... (pause) I think it might be a little loose actually. Let me try tightening it.

Agent: Good call. Yeah, sometimes these things can vibrate loose over time.

Customer: (tightening sounds) Okay, it's tighter now. So should I restart the modem again?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and do that. Unplug it completely, wait about thirty seconds like you did before, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Okay, it's unplugged. I'm counting... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Alright, take your time. While that's booting back up, it should take about two to three minutes to fully initialize. What you want to see is the internet light turn green or blue, depending on your modem model.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... I'm watching it now. The lights are coming on. I see green and orange lights now, but the internet light is still... it's still red. And it's like, blinking red.

Agent: It's still blinking red?

Customer: Yeah, it's not solid red anymore but it's definitely blinking red.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's... (pause) that's a bit unusual. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Let me just verify your modem is actually communicating with our system. (pause) I'm seeing your modem has connected recently, but it's not maintaining a steady connection. That's telling me there might be an issue on the line side or possibly with the modem hardware itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: It could be, but not necessarily. Before we go down that road, let me have you try one more thing. Can you check the battery backup unit if you have one? Sometimes there's a separate box—

Customer: Oh, you mean like the black box thing?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Is there a black box near your modem?

Customer: Yeah, there is. It's got some lights on it.

Agent: Okay, can you unplug that as well? Let that sit for about thirty seconds, and then plug that back in too. That's your battery backup system, and sometimes it can cause conflicts.

Customer: (background noise) Unplugging now. (pause) (pause) Okay, thirty seconds. (pause) Plugging it back in. (beeping sounds in background) Alright, it's back on.

Agent: Good. Now go back to the modem and restart that one more time.

Customer: You want me to restart the modem again?

Agent: Yes, please.

Customer: (sighs) Okay. (pause) (unplugging sounds) Waiting... (long pause) Plugging back in.

Agent: Alright, and while we're waiting for this boot cycle, I have to be honest with you, Michael, we may be looking at either a modem that needs to be replaced or a service line issue that's going to require a technician to come out and check the connection at the network interface box outside your home.

Customer: So it might not just be the modem?

Agent: It could be, but based on what I'm seeing—the inconsistent connection pattern, the fact that the light isn't stabilizing—I want to give you the complete picture. Let me see if the modem comes up this time, and if not, we'll go from there.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... nothing. It's still doing the same thing. The internet light is just blinking red over and over.

Agent: Yeah, that's... (pause) I think at this point we're looking at either the modem needing replacement or a line issue. I can either schedule a technician to come out—that's typically within the next 24 to 48 hours depending on availability—or I can get a replacement modem sent to you, but that would take three to five business days to arrive.

Customer: How much is this going to cost me? I just got this setup like six months ago.

Agent: Well, if it's determined to be a modem defect, there shouldn't be a charge—that would be covered under your equipment. The technician visit would also be covered if it's determined to be a service issue on our end. But if you want to troubleshoot quickly, the technician visit might be your fastest option.

Customer: And how long would they need to be here?

Agent: Usually anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on what they find when they arrive.

Customer: (sighs) I really need my internet working. I work from home. Can I get someone to come out today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability for today in your area. (pause) I'm showing... unfortunately we're pretty booked up for today, but I can get someone scheduled for tomorrow morning. We have a window between 8 AM and 12 PM available.

Customer: That's... I mean, that's not ideal but I guess that's better than waiting five days for a modem. Yeah, let's do tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. You'll get a confirmation text and email with all the details. The technician will have a work order, and they'll be able to diagnose whether it's the modem or the line. Is the phone number on file still good for us to contact you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Excellent. So just to recap, you have a technician visit scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. They'll bring diagnostic equipment and can replace the modem on site if needed, or troubleshoot any line issues. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I hope they can get this fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I understand completely. I really do. The technician team is very good at what they do, so hopefully we'll have you back up and running tomorrow. I'm sorry you're experiencing this today, Michael.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications. You have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
