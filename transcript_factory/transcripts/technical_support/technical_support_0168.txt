# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I can't get it back online. I've tried everything I can think of.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... hold on, let me find my bill. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. And can I get a name please?

Customer: It's David. David Morrison.

Agent: Perfect, David. I see your account here. So you've been without service since this morning?

Customer: Yeah, around 8 AM. I was working from home and everything just... cut out. Totally dead. No lights on the modem or anything.

Agent: Okay, let's start with the basics. Can you walk me through what you're seeing right now? Is your modem powered on?

Customer: Well, that's the thing. I tried plugging it back in and... nothing. No lights are coming on. Not even the power indicator.

Agent: Alright. And that power cord—is it connected firmly to the modem and then to the outlet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean... let me double-check. (sound of movement) Okay, so it's plugged into the wall outlet, and the other end is... hmm, actually, you know what? The connector's a little loose. Let me push it in harder.

Agent: Good idea. Go ahead.

Customer: (brief pause) Okay, I'm pushing it in. I... wait. Still nothing. The modem's still not lighting up.

Agent: Still no power light?

Customer: Nope. Nothing at all.

Agent: Let me ask—do you have any other devices plugged into that same outlet? Like a lamp or anything?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually. There's a lamp there.

Agent: Can you unplug the modem and try plugging that lamp in? Just to verify the outlet's working?

Customer: Oh, good idea. (sound of unplugging) Okay, plugging in the lamp... (pause) ...and it's on. So the outlet works fine.

Agent: Good. That's good. So the outlet's functional. Now, before we go further, do you happen to know if there's been any electrical storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of, but... I mean, my power was fine all morning. The TV was on, the fridge is working...

Agent: Right. Okay. Let's try one more thing with the modem. Sometimes it needs a full power cycle. What we're gonna do is plug it back in and wait a full two minutes before we expect any lights to show up. Can you do that?

Customer: Two minutes? Okay... (sound of plugging in) Plugged back in. I'm watching it now.

Agent: (pause) Sometimes the initial boot sequence takes a minute or so. Just hang tight.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been like... thirty seconds. Still nothing. (pause) One minute... (pause) Nothing. Getting close to two minutes...

Agent: Just a little bit more.

Customer: (pause) Okay, two minutes have passed. Still completely dark. Not a single light.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, that's... that's not what we want to see. Let me pull up some information on your account. (pause) It looks like we did have a service notification in this area yesterday for some maintenance work. Sometimes the modem needs to be fully reset after that. Do you see a small recessed button on the modem? Usually it's on the back.

Customer: Let me look... (pause) Yeah, there is. There's like a little hole with a button.

Agent: Perfect. What I'm gonna need you to do is get a paperclip or a pen—something small and thin—and press and hold that button for about fifteen seconds. This will completely reset the modem.

Customer: Okay, hold on. Let me grab a pen. (pause) Okay, I'm pressing it. (pause) Holding it... (pause) ...fifteen seconds done.

Agent: Did anything change?

Customer: (pause) No. Nothing at all. Still dark.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Okay, David, one more question. Is the power cable that connects to the modem—is there any visible damage to it? Any fraying or burns or anything?

Customer: (pause) Actually, now that you mention it... let me look closer. (pause) No, it looks... it looks fine to me. Kinda old maybe, but no damage that I can see.

Agent: Okay. (pause, typing sounds) Alright, I'm seeing here that this modem unit is now about four years old, and we're really not getting any power indicator at all, which usually means either a failed power supply or an internal hardware issue. Unfortunately, this is likely going to need to be replaced.

Customer: So there's nothing else we can try?

Agent: Well... let me put you on a brief hold real quick. I'm gonna check with my supervisor to see if there's anything else in our troubleshooting protocol I might have missed. Just one moment.

Customer: Okay.

(hold music plays for approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: David? Thanks for holding. I spoke with my supervisor, and unfortunately, we've exhausted the basic troubleshooting steps. With no power light and no response to any of our reset attempts, it does appear to be a hardware failure.

Customer: So what happens now? Do I need to replace it myself or...?

Agent: No, no. We'll send a technician out with a replacement modem. Can we schedule that for a time that works for you? We have availability tomorrow between 9 AM and 12 PM, or later in the afternoon from 2 to 5 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow? Is there any way someone could come out today?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Let me check... (pause) Unfortunately, our technicians are pretty booked up for today, but I can put you on a priority list for a same-day callback if anything opens up. Otherwise, tomorrow morning would be the earliest.

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, okay. Let's do tomorrow morning. Nine to twelve is fine.

Agent: Perfect. We'll have someone out between 9 and noon tomorrow. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully this gets resolved tomorrow.

Agent: Absolutely. We appreciate your patience, and I'm sorry you've been without service today. The technician will get that modem replaced and you should be back up and running. Thank you for calling Frontier, David.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus. Bye.

Agent: You take care. Bye.
