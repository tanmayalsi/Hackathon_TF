Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so my internet went down this morning and I can't get it back online. I've tried restarting the modem and everything, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) actually, let me grab that. One second.

Agent: Take your time.

Customer: Okay, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, thank you. And just to confirm, I'm showing this is for the address on Maple Street in Portland, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned the internet went down this morning. Have you noticed any lights on the modem? Are they on or off?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) Okay, so the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light... that one's red. Or actually, it might be orange? It's kind of dark in here.

Agent: Okay, so if it's not green, that typically indicates a connection issue. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for about 30 seconds? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Yeah, I already did that earlier, but I can do it again.

Agent: I know you have, but let's try it one more time together. (pause) Go ahead and unplug it now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we're waiting, I'm going to check our systems here. (typing sounds) Have you experienced any service outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. I've had Frontier for like... two years now? Never had a problem before.

Agent: That's good to know. Alright, so it's been about 30 seconds. Can you plug the modem back in now?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Plugging it in... (pause) Okay, it's in. (pause) Now we wait?

Agent: Yeah, give it about a minute to fully boot up. While that's happening, can you tell me... do you have a router separate from the modem, or is it a combo unit?

Customer: I have both, actually. They're separate.

Agent: Okay, and is the router powered on right now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I can see the lights on it. They're blinking.

Agent: Alright, good. Let me know when the modem light turns green again.

Customer: (pause) ...Still orange or red or whatever. (pause) Still waiting... (pause) Hmm, nope. Still not green.

Agent: Okay, let me try something different. Can you check if there's a cable that goes from the wall into the modem? Is that cable plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... (pause) wait, let me trace it. Yeah, there's a cable in there. Looks pretty tight.

Agent: Can you try unplugging it and plugging it back in? Sometimes these connections can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (unplugging sound) ...and back in. (pause) Did that help?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check here. Um... (pause) I'm not showing an active connection on our end either. That's... that's interesting. And you're still not seeing that green light?

Customer: Nope. Still the same.

Agent: Alright, have you checked to see if there are any other cables connected to the modem? Sometimes there's a phone line or an... an ethernet cable that might be loose.

Customer: There's like... one other cord. Let me see where it goes. (pause) I don't know, it's kind of a mess back there with all the cables.

Agent: I understand. Can you just give me a quick rundown of what's plugged into the modem? So we have the power cable, the cable from the wall...

Customer: Right, and then there's... it looks like there's another line coming in. Is that the phone line?

Agent: It could be. What color is it?

Customer: Uh... it's like a white cord. Thinner than the others.

Agent: Yeah, that's likely the phone line. Can you make sure that's snug too?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm... I'm checking it. It seems like it's in there pretty good.

Agent: [inaudible] Let me put you on a brief hold while I check something on our backend here. It'll just be a minute.

Customer: Okay.

(hold music for approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Thanks for holding. Okay, so I'm not seeing any service alerts or outages in your area, which is good news. But I am noticing that your modem hasn't registered a connection in the last couple hours. 

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It could be a few things. Either the signal isn't reaching your modem, or there might be an issue with the modem itself. Um... let me ask—when you restart your router, do you see the internet light on the router turn on?

Customer: No, actually, now that you mention it. The router never comes up either.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? There should be a small button, probably recessed, on the back or bottom of the unit.

Customer: (pause) I see it. It's a tiny button.

Agent: Yeah, that's the one. I'm going to need you to hold that down for about 10 seconds while the modem is powered on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm pressing it... (pause) How long has it been?

Agent: Just count to ten in your head. One... two... three...

Customer: (pause) Okay, I think I'm at ten. I'm letting go.

Agent: Alright. This is going to reset the modem to factory settings, so it'll take another minute or so to boot back up. (pause) What we're looking for now is that green internet light.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it... (pause) The power light is on green... (pause) but no... the internet light is still not coming on. It's like... it's not even trying.

Agent: (pause) Alright, um... (pause) I'm going to be honest with you, that's... that's not a good sign. It sounds like there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or there's a problem with the line coming into your home. 

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: Well, I have a few options here. The first would be to have one of our technicians come out and check the line from the street to your house, as well as potentially replace the modem if that's the issue.

Customer: How long would that take? I need internet for work.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... (pause) The earliest I can get someone out would be... it looks like Friday morning between 8 AM and noon. Would that work for you?

Customer: Friday? That's three days away. Is there anything you can do faster?

Agent: Unfortunately, our technician schedule is pretty booked up right now. But let me see if there's a possibility of... (pause) no, I'm sorry. Friday is our next available slot in your area.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, I guess I don't have much choice. But like, I'm still not getting internet. Can you at least confirm that you guys are going to bring a modem?

Agent: I'll make a note here that there's a potential modem failure, and the tech will come prepared. But they may also need to check the external line, so... they'll have what they need either way.

Customer: Alright, I mean... I guess that's something. So Friday morning?

Agent: Yes, Friday between 8 AM and noon. Can I just confirm that someone will be home during that time?

Customer: Yeah, I'll make sure I'm there.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you have it, your service appointment number is 887342. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly.

Customer: Okay, got it.

Agent: I really do apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today. These things can sometimes be a little tricky to diagnose remotely.

Customer: Yeah, I understand. Thanks for trying, Derek.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you Friday morning.

Customer: Yep, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
