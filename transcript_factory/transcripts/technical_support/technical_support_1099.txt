Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out completely. I can't get online at all, and I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. First, let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this a residential account?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So the internet is completely down right now, no connection at all?

Customer: No, nothing. I tried restarting my router about twenty minutes ago, but that didn't help. The lights on the modem aren't even coming on normally. They're just... I don't know, they're acting weird.

Agent: Alright, let's take a look at this. When you say the lights are acting weird, can you describe that a little more? Are they flickering, or are they off?

Customer: Um, yeah, there's like... there's a red light on one side, and then the others are just kind of dim. They're not the normal green and blue that I usually see.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. The red light typically indicates an issue with the connection. Let me just check your account here. (pause) I'm not showing any service interruptions in your area, so this is likely something with your equipment. Do you have a Frontier router and modem, or do you have your own equipment?

Customer: No, I'm using the equipment you guys provided. I've had it for... maybe two years now?

Agent: Got it. Alright, so here's what I'd like you to do. Can you locate your modem? It should be a rectangular box, usually black or white.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's sitting right here by the window.

Agent: Great. I need you to unplug the power cable from the back of the modem. Just pull it out completely.

Customer: Okay, done.

Agent: Perfect. Now I'd like you to wait about thirty seconds. Just give the system a moment to fully power down.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been about thirty seconds.

Agent: Good. Now go ahead and plug the power cable back in.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) It's powering on...

Agent: Great. While that's booting back up, can I ask—have you had any storms recently? Any power outages in the area?

Customer: Actually, yeah. There was a pretty bad storm last night. Trees were down, power flickered a few times. Why, is that... is that related?

Agent: It could be. Sometimes power surges from storms can affect the modem. They're usually pretty resilient, but it does happen. Alright, so the modem should be booting up now. What are the lights showing?

Customer: (pause) Um... still mostly dim. The red light is still there.

Agent: Okay. Sometimes it takes a minute or two. Let's give it another thirty seconds or so.

Customer: (pause) Still the same, honestly. This doesn't look right.

Agent: I hear you. Let me try something else. There should be a small reset button on the back of the modem. It might be recessed in a little hole. Do you see that?

Customer: Let me check... yeah, I think I see it.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to have you hold that for about ten seconds. It'll reset the modem back to factory settings. Fair warning—if you do this, you'll need to reconnect any devices to the WiFi afterwards, but let's see if this helps.

Customer: Alright, pushing it in. (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... (pause) ...and releasing it now.

Agent: Good. Let's give that about a minute to reboot.

Customer: (background noise of waiting) Yeah, so... how long do you think this will take?

Agent: Just another minute or so. Sometimes these resets take a little longer. Let me check your account information again while we wait. (typing sounds)

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm pulling up your service history here. I'm not seeing any recent technical issues on your line. The connection looks fine from our end, which is... (pause) actually makes me think this might be a hardware issue with the modem itself, especially given the storm you mentioned last night.

Customer: So what does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: Well, let's see if this reset helped first. What are the lights showing now?

Customer: Uh... (pause) still the same. Red light, dim lights. Nothing's changed.

Agent: (pause) Okay. And you're definitely seeing that red light on the top or the side of the modem?

Customer: Yeah, it's right there. It's pretty bright, actually. Brighter than the other lights.

Agent: Alright, I've got one more thing we can try. I'm going to have you check the cable connection going into the modem. There should be a coax cable coming from the wall into the modem. Can you see that?

Customer: Um, yeah, I see the cable. It's connected to the wall and the modem.

Agent: Perfect. Can you unplug that cable from the modem side and then plug it back in? Make sure it's nice and tight.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, pulling it out... (pause) ...and plugging it back in now. Pushing it in until it clicks.

Agent: Good. Now let's see if the modem is showing any different lights.

Customer: (pause) Nope. Same thing. Red light, everything else is dim.

Agent: (pause) Alright, so... I'm going to be honest with you. That red light typically indicates a connection issue to our network, and the fact that we're not seeing any problems on our end, combined with the reset not helping and the recent storm you had, it's looking like the modem itself might have been damaged by the power surge.

Customer: Ugh, really? I mean, I guess that makes sense. What do I do now?

Agent: So, I have a couple of options for you. The first option is we can get a replacement modem shipped out to you. It usually takes about five to seven business days to arrive, and then you'd have to go through the setup process.

Customer: Five to seven days? I need internet before that. I'm working from home right now.

Agent: I understand, and I'm sorry about that. The second option would be to see if we have a local service center where you could pick up a replacement modem today. Let me check if we have one near you. What's your address?

Customer: I'm at 1247 Maple Street, in Riverside.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me see what we have... (pause) I'm not showing a walk-in service center in Riverside, unfortunately. The nearest one to you is about twenty-five miles away in the city. Would that be a viable option for you?

Customer: Today? I mean, I'm not sure I can get over there today. I'm in the middle of some work stuff. Can't you guys just fix it remotely or something?

Agent: I wish I could. Unfortunately, once the hardware fails—especially the modem itself—there's not much we can do remotely. It's a physical component issue. But I'm happy to arrange for a technician to come out to your home to install a replacement modem. Would that work better for you?

Customer: How long would that take? When can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... (pause) The soonest I can get a technician out would be... it looks like Thursday, the day after tomorrow, between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work?

Customer: (pause) I guess... I mean, that's still a couple days without internet. Is that really the only option?

Agent: I know it's frustrating. If the modem is indeed damaged, there's unfortunately no way around it. We could do the overnight shipping if you prefer, but that would still take until tomorrow at the earliest, and you'd have to set it up yourself. The technician visit is honestly your best bet because they can make sure everything is installed and working properly right away.

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, okay. Thursday between 1 and 5 is fine, I guess. Do I have to stay home the whole time, or...?

Agent: They typically give you a window like that, yes, but they'll try to be as prompt as possible. I'll go ahead and schedule that for you. Can you confirm your phone number for the appointment?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. And is there a number they should call when they're on the way, or is that the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. That's my cell phone.

Agent: Alright, I've got your appointment scheduled for Thursday from 1 to 5 PM. You should get a confirmation email shortly, and a technician will call you before they arrive. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... hopefully that fixes it.

Agent: I understand your frustration, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Hopefully it is just the modem, and the tech will get you back up and running on Thursday. If you have any other issues or questions before then, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and again, sorry for the inconvenience.

Customer: Yeah, no problem. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
