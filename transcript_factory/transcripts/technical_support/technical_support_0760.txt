# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... I've been without internet for about three hours now and I really need to get this figured out. I work from home and I have a meeting in like twenty minutes.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online as quickly as we can. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing your account here. It looks like you're on our Fiber 200 plan in the Cedar Rapids area. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So when you say your internet isn't working, are you not seeing any lights on your modem right now?

Customer: Uh, there's... there's one light on. It's like, I don't know, orange or red maybe? Usually it's blue and green.

Agent: Okay, so that red light typically indicates there's a connection issue. That's actually helpful information. Let me walk you through a few quick steps. First, can you unplug the modem from power? Just pull the cable right out of the back.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm doing that now. It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now, while we wait, can you also check if there are any cables that might have come loose? There should be a fiber cable coming into your modem. Can you see that?

Customer: Um, let me look... I'm not really sure what I'm looking at, to be honest. There's a lot of wires back here. Is it white? I see a white cable.

Agent: So there might be a couple white cables, actually. The fiber cable is typically the smaller one, about the size of a... well, it's pretty thin. Does it look like anything might have been bumped or moved?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't... I don't think so. Everything looks pretty secure.

Agent: Okay, that's good. Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in now. Let's give it about a minute to boot back up.

Customer: Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Should I be hearing anything? It's making a beeping sound...

Agent: (chuckles lightly) Yeah, that's totally normal. That's just the startup sequence. Give it about thirty to forty-five seconds and you should start seeing some lights come on.

Customer: Alright... (long pause) ...Okay, I'm seeing some lights now. There's a blue one and a... a green one I think. Is that good?

Agent: That sounds like it's working! Do you have internet back?

Customer: Um... let me check. (pause) I'm trying to load something on my computer but... no, it's still not connecting. It's still saying no internet.

Agent: Hm, okay. So the modem lights look good but your devices aren't connecting. Let me ask you this—do you have a WiFi router separate from the modem, or is it all built into one unit?

Customer: It's... I think it's just all one thing? It's the box that Frontier gave me.

Agent: Okay, so it's a modem-router combo. That's fine. Can you check the WiFi on your computer and see if you're seeing your network name available?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... yeah, I see "FrontierWiFi-4782" there. But when I try to connect, it's just not working. It keeps saying it can't connect.

Agent: Alright, try forgetting that network and then reconnecting to it. You might need to enter your password again. The password should be on a sticker on the back of your modem.

Customer: Okay... (pause, rustling sounds) I'm looking at the back of it now. I see a sticker... it's got a really long password. This is going to take me a minute to type this in.

Agent: No problem, take your time.

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm typing it in... and... (pause) nope, still says can't connect. It's saying "incorrect password" even though I'm copying it directly from the sticker.

Agent: Hmm, that's unusual. Can you try it one more time, just to be safe?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me try again... (typing sounds) No, same thing. Still saying incorrect password.

Agent: Okay, let me try something else. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? I know that sounds drastic, but sometimes that can help with these connection issues. What I need you to do is find the small reset button—

Customer: Wait, won't that erase everything? I don't want to lose my settings or whatever.

Agent: That's a great question. So a factory reset will restore the modem to its default settings, which means it will reconnect to our network and you'll essentially set it up like it's brand new. It shouldn't affect any of your personal files or anything on your computer.

Customer: Okay... I guess that's... I'm a little nervous about this, but go ahead.

Agent: So there's a small reset button, usually recessed into the modem. You'll need a paperclip or a pen to press it. Hold it down for about ten seconds while the modem is powered on.

Customer: (pause, rustling sounds) Okay, I found it... I think. I'm using a paperclip. (pause) Holding it down... (pause) ...it's... all the lights just went off.

Agent: That's perfect, that's exactly what should happen. Now just let it sit for another two minutes or so and let it boot back up.

Customer: (pause) This is taking forever...

Agent: I know, I know, it can feel like it. But you're doing great. While we wait, can I ask—have you had any issues with your service recently? Any outages or problems before today?

Customer: No, not really. It was working fine this morning. I was checking my email and everything was normal, and then at like... I don't know, around two o'clock, I just noticed it stopped working.

Agent: Okay, and you haven't done anything to the modem or any cables in that time?

Customer: No, nothing. I didn't touch anything.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay... I'm actually checking our system here and I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, so that's good. (pause) How are those lights looking now?

Customer: Um, they're... one is blue, one is green... there's actually a third one now that's kind of orange or amber maybe?

Agent: Okay, so the orange one might be indicating that it's still in the boot-up process. Give it just another thirty seconds or so.

Customer: (pause) Still there... I'm not seeing any change.

Agent: Alright, let's try connecting again. See if your WiFi network shows up and if you can connect to it now.

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking for the network... I see it. Trying to connect... (longer pause) ...it's... no, it's still not working. Still saying incorrect password.

Agent: That's... okay, that's unusual. Let me ask you something. When you look at the WiFi password on the sticker, do you see any characters that might be hard to distinguish? Like, a zero versus the letter O, or a one versus an L?

Customer: (pause) Let me look closer... there's... yeah, actually there might be. There's definitely some that look similar. There's a "1" that looks like an "L"... there's some zeros that might be the letter O...

Agent: That's probably it then. Those can be really tricky. Try going through and replacing those zeros with the letter O and see if that helps.

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, trying it with... let me see... (pause) nope, still not working.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me try a different approach. I'm going to have you log into the modem's admin panel directly and see if we can get more information about what's happening. Can you open a web browser and go to the address 192.168.0.1?

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to... (pause) ...nothing's happening. It's like it's trying to load but it's just stuck.

Agent: (sigh) Okay. Um, you know what, I'm going to be honest with you—I'm seeing some indicators here in your account that might suggest this could be a hardware issue with the modem itself. The fact that we've reset it and the lights appear to be coming on, but we're still not getting a connection despite trying multiple troubleshooting steps...

Customer: Wait, so is my modem broken? I just got this a few months ago.

Agent: I'm not entirely certain, but it's looking like that might be a possibility. I think what we should do at this point is schedule a technician visit to your home. They can run some tests and either get it working or potentially swap out the modem for you.

Customer: How long would that take? Like, can they come today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... I'm looking at today's schedule and unfortunately all of our technicians are booked. I can get someone out to you tomorrow though. Would morning or afternoon work better for you?

Customer: I really needed this working today though. Is there really no one who can come?

Agent: I'm very sorry, I wish I could get someone there today. But I am able to schedule you for tomorrow, and I can put you at the top of the list for first appointment. How does tomorrow morning between eight and ten AM sound?

Customer: (pause) I guess that'll have to work. But I really need this resolved tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand, and I promise we'll get this taken care of. Let me get some information from you for the visit...
