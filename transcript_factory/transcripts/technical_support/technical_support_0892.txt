Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it back up and running.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that now. And just to confirm, this is for your residence on Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great, thanks. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Um, let me look... the modem has... I think the power light is on? But nothing else seems to be lit up. Usually there's like a blue light blinking and that's not there.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So the power is on but you're not seeing the connection lights. Have you tried unplugging the modem yet to do a restart?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Go ahead and unplug it for me, and we'll wait about thirty seconds and then plug it back in. That clears the cache and usually resolves a lot of these connection issues.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. I'm gonna wait... (longer pause) ...okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and let that boot back up. It should take maybe two to three minutes to fully initialize. While we're waiting, let me ask you—have you had any storms in your area recently? Or any recent service work done at your location?

Customer: No storms that I'm aware of. And no, no work done recently. It was working fine yesterday, I used it all day.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. (pause) So how's that modem looking now? Are you seeing those lights come back on?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm seeing... the power light's on, and now I'm seeing a little orange light but the blue connection light still isn't coming on. Is that normal?

Agent: The orange light usually indicates it's still trying to establish a connection or there might be an issue with the signal from our end. Let me run a quick line test here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm showing that we are detecting your modem on our network, which is good. But I'm not seeing a strong signal coming through. 

Have you checked all your cables? Like, make sure the coaxial cable—that's the thicker cable coming from the wall—is screwed in tight?

Customer: The one from the wall? Let me... yeah, I'm looking at it now. (pause) It looks pretty tight, but let me try tightening it more to be sure.

Agent: Good idea, just make sure it's snug. Sometimes they can get loose over time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I tightened it. Now I'm getting... wait, now I see the blue light is flickering a little bit. Does that mean it's working?

Agent: That's a good sign that it's trying to sync. Let me check our end again. (pause, typing sounds) Hmm, I'm still not seeing a stable connection. The signal is pretty weak coming through on our line. 

Let me ask you something else—is your modem the one we provided, or do you have your own?

Customer: I think it's the one you guys gave me when I signed up. It's been working for like two years with no problems.

Agent: Okay, yeah, that shouldn't be an issue then. (pause) Can you describe what you're seeing on your computer or phone right now? Are you getting any error messages?

Customer: Well, when I try to connect to the Wi-Fi, my laptop just says "no internet connection." And the Wi-Fi isn't even showing up on my phone right now.

Agent: Okay, so the Wi-Fi network isn't broadcasting. That confirms the modem isn't fully syncing. Let me try a couple other things here. Can you check if there's a reset button on the modem—it's usually a small recessed button?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see a little button on the back. Do you want me to press it?

Agent: Actually, let me check something first before we do a full reset, because that will erase your settings. Let me try to push a reboot signal to the modem from our end. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm sending that now. Can you tell me if you see any changes?

Customer: (pause) It's... the lights are flickering more now. The orange and blue are kind of going back and forth.

Agent: That's it trying to reconnect. Let's give that a minute or two to fully cycle through.

Customer: (long pause) No, it's still just flickering. This isn't looking good, is it?

Agent: Let's... let's not give up just yet. I'm going to check a few more things on our end. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that your line is showing some signal degradation. It's possible there could be an issue with the line coming into your neighborhood or even into your home. 

Let me try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem again and—this time when you plug it back in—can you also restart your router if you have a separate one?

Customer: I just have the modem, I think. I don't have a separate router.

Agent: That's fine. Okay, go ahead and unplug it again for me.

Customer: (pause) Unplugged.

Agent: Let it sit for about a minute this time.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, it's been about a minute.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. (pause) Lights are coming on again... power light, the online light is... it's orange again.

Agent: (typing sounds) I'm checking our signals here. (pause) I'm still getting a weak signal on my end. This is unusual because, like you said, it was working fine yesterday. What I'm thinking at this point is that there may be a line issue between our equipment and your location, or possibly with the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, I'd like to get a technician out to your location to physically check the line and the equipment. Typically we can schedule that for you, usually within 24 to 48 hours depending on availability. Would that work for you?

Customer: How much is that going to cost me?

Agent: Since your service isn't working at all, there shouldn't be a charge for the service call. We warranty that. If it turns out to be something inside your home, there might be a charge, but we'll assess it when the tech gets there.

Customer: I guess that's fine. When can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our available appointments. Are you available anytime during business hours? We typically have morning and afternoon slots.

Customer: Um, I work from home, so I should be around. What's your earliest availability?

Agent: (pause) I'm showing we have a slot available tomorrow morning between 8 and 10 AM. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. I'm putting in a work order now, and a technician will be out tomorrow between 8 and 10 AM. (typing sounds) Okay, you should receive a confirmation email shortly at the email on your account. That has the technician's direct number in case you need to reach them or reschedule.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: You can try keeping the modem unplugged overnight and plugging it back in in the morning—sometimes that helps. But honestly, given the signal issue I'm seeing, I think we need the tech to take a look at the physical line. The good news is we'll get you back up and running soon.

Customer: Okay, thanks. I really hope this gets fixed tomorrow because I need my internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll make sure this is a priority. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and sorry for the trouble today. We'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
