# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications support. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without service for like two hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here so we can get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. I'm showing your service address is 422 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage? The service just stopped working this morning?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I was working from home and everything was fine, and then around 8:30 it just... died. The router's still on though. Like, the lights are still blinking and everything.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful to know. So your router is powered on but you're not getting any internet connection. Have you tried unplugging the modem and router yet? Sometimes a quick restart can resolve these issues.

Customer: Uh, no, I haven't. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Go ahead and unplug the power cable from your modem first—that's the box that connects to your wall outlet. Just unplug it and wait about thirty seconds.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause) Alright, unplugged. How long do I wait?

Agent: Just about thirty seconds. While you're waiting, can you tell me if there are any lights on the front of your modem right now?

Customer: Um, yeah, they're all off now that I unplugged it.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in after thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Great. So give it about a minute to boot back up. You should see the lights start coming back on. What you're looking for is a solid light or a slowly blinking light—that usually indicates a good connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, the lights are coming back. I see like a green light now... and there's a couple other ones blinking.

Agent: Excellent. That sounds like it's booting up normally. Give it just another minute or so to fully initialize. Can you try opening your web browser and see if you can access any websites?

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) Um... no, it's still not loading. I'm trying Google and it's just... it's spinning. Nothing's happening.

Agent: Alright, okay. Let me try a couple other things. Do you see any sort of alert lights on the modem? Like any red lights or amber lights?

Customer: Let me look closer... (pause) Yeah, actually, there's like a red light. It's solid red. Is that bad?

Agent: That could indicate a connection issue on our end. Let me check for any service alerts or outages in your area. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported right now. Let me also try to see if I can ping your modem from here. (pause) Hmm, I'm not getting a response from your device, which tells me there might be an issue with the connection between your modem and our network.

Customer: Is that... is that something you can fix from there?

Agent: I can try a few more things. Let me have you do what's called a factory reset on your modem. This will clear out any corrupted settings. On your modem, there should be a small recessed button—usually labeled "Reset." You'll need to use something like a paperclip to hold it down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause, rustling sounds) Okay, I found it. I'm holding it... holding it... (pause) Okay, I let go.

Agent: Good. Now it's going to restart and go through a full reboot. This might take a couple minutes.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's restarting. Lights are going off and back on again.

Agent: [inaudible] while we wait for that. So how long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, um, about three years now. Service has been pretty good until today.

Agent: Well, hopefully we can get you squared away here. (pause) Alright, do you see those lights coming back on?

Customer: Yeah, they're back. I see the green light again, but... (pause) ...the red light is still there too.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Unfortunately, that red light is still a problem. The fact that it's persisting after a reset suggests there might be an issue with your line coming from outside. Have you noticed any recent storms or any activity outside your house?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been clear all morning.

Agent: Alright. I want to try one more thing. Can you check if there are any loose cables connected to your modem? Look at the cable that comes from the wall and plugs into the back of the modem.

Customer: (pause, rustling) Okay, let me see... I'm looking at the back here... it looks pretty secure to me. It's tight.

Agent: Okay, no loose connections there. Let me try to reset your account on my end. Sometimes that can help re-establish the connection. (typing sounds, pause) I'm going to do that now and then I want you to unplug the modem one more time and wait a full minute this time.

Customer: Alright. (pause) Unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, I'm waiting.

Agent: (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause, sounds of plugging in) It's back in. (pause) Lights are starting up again... (long pause) ...okay, green light is on, but the red light is still showing.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm... I'm still not getting a connection signal on my end either. Unfortunately, at this point, I think we're looking at a potential issue with the line coming into your property. That would require a technician to come out and diagnose what's happening.

Customer: Really? So you can't fix it from there?

Agent: Not from my end, no. This is beyond what I can troubleshoot remotely. I want to get you a technician to come out and check the line. The good news is that I can get someone out there for you fairly quickly.

Customer: How quickly? I really need my internet for work.

Agent: I can get you scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. We have appointments available between 1 and 5 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: (pause) I guess it'll have to, yeah. Let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that set up for you now. (typing sounds) Okay, you're all scheduled for tomorrow, Thursday, between 1 and 5 PM. Our technician will come out and check the external line to see what's causing that connection issue. Is the address I have on file, 422 Maple Street, still correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. We'll send you a confirmation email shortly. Your appointment number is FT-4847293. Can I get a phone number where we can reach you tomorrow?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Perfect. We'll call you about thirty minutes before our technician arrives. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved remotely today, but our technician will get to the bottom of this tomorrow. We really appreciate your patience, and thanks for being a Frontier customer.

Customer: Yeah, thanks.

Agent: You have a good day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
