# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got a meeting coming up in like an hour and I really need to get this working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your Frontier account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm seeing an account for a Mr...?

Customer: It's James. James Murphy.

Agent: Perfect, James. So you're completely without internet at the moment?

Customer: Yeah, completely. The router's on, it's got power, but nothing's connecting. I've got my laptop, my phone, my wife's tablet — none of them are getting online.

Agent: Alright, okay. That does sound like it could be a few different things. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me — do you see any lights on the router itself? Any that are red or orange?

Customer: (pause) Um, let me look at it real quick. It's... there's a blue light on the front, and then there's... I think one of the lights on the side is orange? Yeah, the orange one.

Agent: Okay, good. So that orange light typically indicates that we might not be getting a signal from our network. Let me ask you this — have you had any recent power outages or storms in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine last night when I checked.

Agent: Right, right. Okay, so what I'd like to do is have you restart the router. You can just unplug it from the back, and then we'll wait about thirty seconds, and plug it back in. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause, sound of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And let's just give it a little time here... (pause) while we're waiting, has anything changed with your setup recently? New equipment, moved anything around?

Customer: No, nothing's changed. Same setup I've had for like six months.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, go ahead and plug that back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause, plugging sounds) Okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: (pause) Alright. So now we're just gonna give it about a minute or so to boot back up. Can you watch that blue light for me and let me know when it comes on?

Customer: (pause) Okay... it's coming back on now. Yeah, the blue light's back.

Agent: Excellent. Now, what about that orange light? Is that still there?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's still there. Still blinking orange.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, that's... that's not ideal. Let me try something else. Can you check if there's a coaxial cable — that's the thick cable with the metal connector — running from the wall into the back of your modem?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I see it. It's connected.

Agent: Okay, can you try unplugging that from the modem end and then plugging it back in? Just make sure it's nice and snug?

Customer: (pause) Okay, doing that now... yep, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Give that a few seconds to see if the light changes. (pause) Anything?

Customer: No, still orange. Still blinking.

Agent: Alright, um... (pause) let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) James, I'm not seeing any service interruptions in your area, so that's good news. But I am noticing that we may need to look at this a little more carefully. Can you tell me — is there a modem separate from your router, or are they combined in one unit?

Customer: Uh, I think they're separate? There's the router thing, and then there's another box that's... I don't know, bigger and kinda sits on top of it?

Agent: Okay, so the bigger box would be your modem. Can you check that one? Does it have lights as well?

Customer: (pause) Oh yeah, it does. Um... I've got a light on, looks like it's green, and then there's another one that's... red? Yeah, red.

Agent: Okay, that red light on the modem is probably the issue then. That typically indicates there's no connection coming from our network. Now, we're gonna need to check the cable that's running from the wall outlet to your modem. Can you see that?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It looks fine to me.

Agent: Can you try disconnecting that cable and then reconnecting it, just like we did with the other one?

Customer: (pause) Okay... done. (pause) Nope, still red.

Agent: Alright. (pause, typing sounds) Let me put you on a brief hold while I check a couple things on the line from our network side. This should just take about a minute.

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent: (hold music, brief pause)

Agent: James? You still there?

Customer: Yep, I'm here.

Agent: Okay, so I've checked our network on this side, and everything appears to be active and ready to provide service to your address. The issue seems to be with either the modem itself or possibly the connection between our network and your equipment. Now, this is a bit of a tricky situation because I can't quite diagnose the exact problem remotely. Have you noticed any burning smells or anything unusual coming from either the modem or router?

Customer: No, nothing like that. They just feel normal, like... room temperature.

Agent: Okay, good. Um, let me try one more thing. Sometimes a full reset of the modem can help. There's usually a small reset button on the back of the modem, sometimes recessed. Do you see anything like that?

Customer: (pause, rustling sounds) Let me look... Yeah, I think I see it. There's a tiny hole with what looks like a button inside.

Agent: Perfect. Now, I do want to warn you that this is going to reset the modem to factory settings, which means we'll need to reconfigure it, but it's worth a shot. You can use a paperclip or a pen to press it, just hold it for about fifteen seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it down... (pause) ...fifteen seconds is up. Now what?

Agent: Okay, let's let it restart. This might take a couple minutes.

Customer: (long pause) ...Alright, it's... rebooting, I guess? I'm seeing lights flashing.

Agent: That's normal. That's good. Just let it finish doing its thing. (pause) How's it looking now?

Customer: (pause) Okay, the lights have... they're staying on now instead of flashing. But that red light is still there.

Agent: (pause) It's still red?

Customer: Yeah, still red.

Agent: Alright, um... (typing sounds, pause) James, I hate to say this, but at this point, what we're looking at is likely either a modem hardware failure or a line issue that I'm not able to resolve from here over the phone. 

Customer: Wait, so I'm not gonna have internet for my meeting?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Here's what I can do for you. I can schedule a technician to come out to your location to physically check the line and inspect your equipment. We typically have availability within twenty-four to forty-eight hours, depending on your location. There wouldn't be a service call fee since we haven't been able to get this resolved remotely.

Customer: When can they come? Like, today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. Unfortunately, our technicians for today are fully booked, but I can get someone out to you tomorrow between... let me see... between 8 AM and 12 PM, or between 12 PM and 5 PM. Which window would work better for you?

Customer: (sighs) I guess the morning. 8 to 12.

Agent: Perfect. I'll get that scheduled for you tomorrow morning. You should receive a confirmation email and possibly a text message within the next few minutes. Is the number on file still the best way to reach you if the technician needs to contact you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Alright, James. I really do apologize that we couldn't get this resolved today. I know this is frustrating, especially with your meeting coming up. Is there anything else I can help you with right now?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: You're welcome. We'll get you back online tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day, James.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
