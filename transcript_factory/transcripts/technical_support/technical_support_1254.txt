# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went out completely. It's been down for like... I don't know, maybe an hour now? And I need to get it back up.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this resolved. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. One moment... Alright, I've got your account. Your service address is on Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you're experiencing a complete outage, no internet connection at all?

Customer: Right, nothing. The modem's still on, the lights are on, but... nothing's working. I can't get online at all.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me—are you using our Frontier-provided modem and router, or do you have your own equipment?

Customer: It's yours. The one you guys gave me when you installed it about two years ago.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, so the first thing I'd like you to do is take a look at the modem. Can you see which lights are lit up right now?

Customer: Uh, yeah. Let me look... I see a power light, that's solid green. And then there's like a... I think it's the internet light? That one's orange or amber or whatever.

Agent: Okay, so the power is good, but the internet light being orange means it's trying to connect but hasn't established a connection. That's helpful information. What I'd like to do is power cycle the modem. Can you unplug it from the power source for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, doing it now.

Agent: Perfect. Just leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds, okay?

Customer: Okay, I'm just... (background noise) ...sitting here waiting.

Agent: No problem. While we're waiting, have you noticed any storms or power outages in your area recently?

Customer: Actually, yeah. There was some lightning last night. I didn't think much of it, but now that you mention it...

Agent: That could definitely be a factor. (typing sounds) Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: Okay, plugging it back in... (pause) ...it's booting up now. I can see the lights coming back.

Agent: Great. Let's give it about 60 seconds to fully boot up and reconnect.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I'm waiting.

Agent: Is there anything else unusual you noticed before the internet went down? Any sounds from the modem or anything?

Customer: No, not really. It just... it was working fine yesterday, and then this morning I tried to check my email and nothing. Just nothing.

Agent: Understood. Alright, it should be about a minute now. Are you seeing any changes in the lights?

Customer: (pause) Um... the internet light is still the same color. Orange. It's not changing.

Agent: Still orange, okay. Let's try a full factory reset on the modem. Sometimes that can help. On the back of the modem, there should be a small button labeled "reset." Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... yeah, I think so. It's really small, right? Like you'd need a paperclip?

Agent: Exactly. You've got it. Go ahead and hold that reset button for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Doing that now... (pause) ...okay, I held it. How long until it comes back?

Agent: This might take a couple minutes since it's resetting to factory settings. Why don't we wait about three minutes and then I'll ask you to check again?

Customer: Alright, I can do that.

Agent: (pause) So while we wait, have you had any service interruptions with us before?

Customer: No, actually. You've been pretty reliable. This is the first real problem I've had.

Agent: That's good to hear. Well, hopefully we can get this sorted out quick. (typing sounds) I'm actually checking our systems right now to see if there are any known outages in your area...

Customer: And?

Agent: I'm showing... actually, I am seeing a note here. There was some infrastructure work being done in your neighborhood yesterday due to weather damage. The crew reported completing it, but let me check the status. (pause) Hmm. It says it was completed, but I'm seeing a flag here that suggests there might still be an issue.

Customer: Oh wow. So it might not be my modem?

Agent: It's possible, yes. But we're not there yet. Let me have you check on that modem. Are the lights doing anything different now?

Customer: (pause) No, it still looks the same. Power light is green, but that internet light is still orange. It hasn't changed at all.

Agent: Still orange. Okay, let me try one more thing. I'm going to send a restart command to your modem from here in the system. This might cause the lights to blink or flicker. Can you keep an eye on it?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my eyes on it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, sending that now... (pause)

Customer: (pause) It's flickering a little... okay, the lights are blinking... and now they're settling again. But it's still... (pause) ...still orange.

Agent: The internet light is still orange?

Customer: Yes. Still orange. It's definitely not connecting.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm going to be honest with you. That's not responding the way it should. Let me check something. We actually did have that infrastructure work yesterday, and I'm seeing a note that a technician may need to go back out to your area to verify everything. Can I put you on a brief hold while I check the ticket system to see what's going on?

Customer: Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

Agent: Thank you. (hold music plays) (pause) (hold music ends) Okay, I'm back. So I've reviewed the ticket, and it looks like the crew finished the work yesterday evening, but there may be a loose connection or an issue with the line coming to your house. Unfortunately, I'm not able to resolve that remotely.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long until someone can fix it?

Agent: That means we're going to need to send a technician out to your location. Let me check our availability... (typing sounds) We have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have another slot on Thursday afternoon. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Really? Tomorrow's the soonest? I need my internet today if possible.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see if there's any way... (pause) Unfortunately, our technicians are pretty booked up today due to the storm damage in the area. But I will note this as a priority, and I can put you on a priority callback list in case we have a cancellation. Would that work?

Customer: I guess that'll have to do. Yeah, put me on the list.

Agent: Perfect. And I'll go ahead and schedule you for tomorrow morning as a backup. Between 8 and 12 PM. You'll receive a call confirmation, and our technician will contact you about 30 minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything I should try in the meantime?

Agent: You can try leaving the modem unplugged overnight and then plugging it back in first thing in the morning. Sometimes that helps. But honestly, based on what we're seeing here, I think you'll need that technician visit.

Customer: Alright. Well, I appreciate your help anyway, Marcus.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. I know it's inconvenient. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: Absolutely. And again, we'll keep you on that priority callback list in case someone can get out today. You should see a confirmation email shortly with all the details. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a good day.
