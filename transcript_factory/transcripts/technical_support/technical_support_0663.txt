# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried restarting my router and everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm pulling that up now. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 428 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned you've already tried restarting the router. That's great. Let me just check a couple of things on my end first. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the router powered on?

Customer: Yeah, the router's on. I can see the lights are on, but the internet light... I think it's supposed to be blue or something? It's like... it's red. Or orange maybe. It's definitely not the right color.

Agent: Okay, okay. So the internet light is showing red or orange. That usually indicates there's no connection coming into your modem. Let me check if there are any outages in your area. (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, I'm not showing any outages reported in your neighborhood right now. When did you first notice the internet went down?

Customer: Like I said, about an hour ago. I was just browsing, you know, nothing crazy, and then my stream just buffered and didn't come back. Then I looked at the router and realized nothing was connecting.

Agent: Right. And just to be thorough here—have you noticed any storms in your area recently, or any issues with your equipment physically? Any loose cables or anything like that?

Customer: No storms. I mean, it rained a little bit this morning but nothing crazy. And no, I haven't touched anything. Everything looks fine physically from what I can see.

Agent: Alright. Let's try a few things. First, I want you to unplug your modem—that's the box that the cables are going into, separate from the router. Just unplug it from the wall.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now... (pause) Yep, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Leave that unplugged for about 30 seconds. While we're waiting, can you tell me if you've experienced any issues like this before with your Frontier service?

Customer: No, this is the first time. I've had pretty good service with you guys actually. It's usually pretty reliable.

Agent: That's good to hear. We appreciate that. Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. (pause) The lights are... one light is blinking now.

Agent: That's normal. That means it's booting back up. It should take maybe two to three minutes to fully boot. Let's give it a minute and then we can check again. So while we wait, have you had any recent changes to your account? New equipment, anything installed recently?

Customer: No, everything's been the same for like... six months maybe? Since we set it up.

Agent: (pause) Okay, and you're still not able to connect to any internet right now?

Customer: Correct. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, let me check on that modem. Is the internet light still blinking, or has it changed?

Customer: Um... (pause) it's still blinking. Maybe a little slower than before?

Agent: Okay, okay. Let's give it just a little bit more time. Sometimes these can take a few minutes. While that's completing, let me pull up some diagnostics on my end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me... when was the last time you did a factory reset on the modem?

Customer: A factory reset? I don't think I've ever done that. Is that something I need to do?

Agent: Well, it might help, but let's not do that yet. Let's see if we can get you up and running first. Can you check on that internet light for me? What's it showing now?

Customer: (pause) Still blinking. Actually, wait... it might be a different speed blink? I'm not really sure what I'm looking for.

Agent: Yeah, that's fine. Um... okay, let me try something else. Can you check the back of your modem and tell me if there are any cables that might be loose? Any of the cables plugged into the back?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... okay, so I've got what looks like a power cable, and then there's like... a coaxial cable? Is that what it's called? That's plugged in. And then there's an ethernet cable running to my router. Everything looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Good, good. That's what we want to see. Alright, um... (pause) Let me try one more thing here. I'm going to restart your modem from my end and see if that helps establish the connection. Just give me one second.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I've sent that command. Can you watch the modem for me? Let me know if you see any changes in the lights.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, so... the lights all went off for a second and now they're coming back on.

Agent: That's what should happen. Okay, and the internet light?

Customer: (pause) Same thing. It's blinking again. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize. Um... (pause) Alright, let me check one more thing on my end. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm showing that the modem is attempting to connect, but it's not establishing a connection from the line side. That could indicate a few different things.

Customer: Like what? Is there an outage or something?

Agent: Well, it's not showing on my end, but there could be an issue with the line itself, or possibly with the signal coming into your home. Um... [inaudible] sorry, let me see here. (pause) So at this point, what I'd recommend is... well, I think we might need to schedule a technician to come out and check the line physically. There could be a signal issue, or potentially a problem with the equipment outside.

Customer: How long does that take? I kind of need my internet for work, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) So the earliest we can get someone out would be... (pause) tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we have another slot on Friday afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow morning is better. Can you do that?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll get that scheduled for you. Can I just confirm the address one more time? 428 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So we have a technician scheduled for tomorrow, between 8 AM and noon. They'll come out and diagnose the issue with the line. Before they arrive, is there anything else you'd like me to try tonight? I know it's not ideal, but I don't want to leave any stone unturned.

Customer: (pause) I don't know... like I said, I've already restarted everything. Do you think a factory reset would help?

Agent: It's possible, but at this point, I think the issue is likely on our end with the line connection, so a factory reset probably won't resolve it. But if you want to try it, I can walk you through it. Just keep in mind it will wipe out all your settings.

Customer: No, I'll just wait for the technician tomorrow. I don't want to mess anything else up.

Agent: That's probably the safest bet. Alright, so your appointment is set for tomorrow morning, 8 to noon. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. Our technician's name will be provided as well. Is there anything else I can help you with tonight?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I hope so too. I really do apologize for the inconvenience. We appreciate your patience and your business. If you need anything in the meantime, you can always call us back at the number on your bill.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good night.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.
