Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging the router and everything.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! I'd be happy to help you get back online. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now... Got it. So you're in the Millbrook area, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, you've already tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in?

Customer: Yeah, I did that about fifteen minutes ago. It came back on for like two seconds and then just died again.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So it was working and then it shut down? Did anything happen right before it went out? Like a power surge or anything?

Customer: No, I don't think so. It was just... working fine and then I looked over and all the lights were off.

Agent: Alright. Let me check if there are any outages in your area. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any major outages on our end, so let's go through some troubleshooting steps together. First, can you tell me what lights, if any, are showing on your modem right now?

Customer: Um, nothing. It's completely dark. Not a single light.

Agent: Okay, and is it powered on? Like, is it... is it plugged in?

Customer: Yeah, I checked that already. The power cable is definitely plugged into the wall and into the modem.

Agent: And the wall outlet itself, is it working? Do you have anything else plugged into it?

Customer: Actually, let me... (pause) I have a lamp plugged in next to it. Let me turn that on real quick.

Agent: Good idea.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the lamp works, so the outlet is fine.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so we know the outlet is good. Let me ask you this—is there a power button on the modem, or do you see any kind of reset button?

Customer: Uh, there's like a little button on the back, but I'm not sure what it does.

Agent: That's probably the reset button. Before we do that though, I want to try something else. Can you unplug the modem completely for about thirty seconds? And while you do that, I'm going to check a few things on my end.

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) (sounds of movement) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: (typing sounds) Thanks. Just... just give it a few more seconds here. Actually, go ahead and count to thirty if you don't mind.

Customer: (laughs) Alright, one... two... three... (pause) ...twenty-eight... twenty-nine... thirty.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's watch and see if any lights come on. Any activity yet?

Customer: (pause) Um... no. Still nothing. This is weird.

Agent: Yeah, let me... let me try one more thing. I'm going to send a restart signal to your modem from here. This should take about two minutes. Just keep watching it and let me know if anything changes.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (long pause) Still nothing, man. This is really frustrating. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I totally understand. I know this is inconvenient. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm not seeing any response from the modem on my end either, which tells me there might be a hardware issue. Before we go down that road though, let's try that reset button we talked about. Do you still have access to it?

Customer: Yeah, it's right here on the back.

Agent: Okay, so there should be a small hole with a button inside. You might need something thin like a paperclip to press it.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I see it. (pause) I got a pen. Should I...?

Agent: Actually, a paperclip would be better because it's thinner. Do you have one nearby?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... Yeah, I got one. (sounds of movement) Alright, I'm ready.

Agent: Okay, so go ahead and press and hold that reset button for about ten seconds. This is going to reset the modem to factory settings, so it'll take a little while to boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... (pause) Let me know when...? Or should I just hold it for ten?

Agent: Yeah, just go ahead and hold it for ten seconds and then let go.

Customer: (pause) Okay. (pause) Alright, I let go. Anything?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let's give it another minute or so to start up. These modems take a bit to boot after a reset.

Customer: (pause) Still dark over here.

Agent: (longer pause) (typing sounds) Hmm. Okay, um... I'm still not seeing any activity from your modem. Can you... can you describe the modem to me? What color is it, and do you see a model number anywhere?

Customer: It's white. Um, there's some stuff on the bottom... It says... Frontier... and then something... FXC... something.

Agent: Okay, that helps. And you're absolutely certain the power cable is fully seated in the modem?

Customer: (pause) Let me check. (sounds of movement) Yeah, it's all the way in.

Agent: Alright. Look, I'm going to be straight with you. Based on what we're seeing, it seems like your modem might have experienced a hardware failure. The fact that it came on briefly and then shut off completely is a pretty strong indicator that there might be an internal issue.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Like, can you fix it?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. We would need to send you a replacement modem. I can definitely expedite that for you—we have next-day delivery available in your area.

Customer: Next-day? So I won't have internet until tomorrow?

Agent: (pause) I know that's frustrating. Let me see what I can do on my end. Unfortunately, we can't troubleshoot this further remotely, and I don't see any way around needing a hardware replacement at this point.

Customer: This is really not ideal. Is there anything else we can try?

Agent: Um, well... (pause) let me try one more thing. Sometimes modems go into a protection mode if there's been a power surge. Let me send another restart command, and this time let's leave it unplugged for a full minute. Can you do that?

Customer: Sure, yeah. (sounds of unplugging) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. I'm going to set a timer here on my end. Just... just leave it unplugged and don't touch anything for a full sixty seconds.

Customer: (long pause) How much longer?

Agent: (pause) You're at about forty seconds. Just a little bit more.

Customer: (pause) Okay...

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (sounds of plugging) Okay, plugged in. (pause) [inaudible]... still nothing.

Agent: Yeah, I'm not seeing anything on my end either. (pause) I'm really sorry, but I think we're at the point where we need to replace the unit. Let me get you set up with a replacement modem and I'll make sure we get you expedited shipping at no extra charge.

Customer: Okay, I guess that's my only option then.

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately. But I want to make sure we get this resolved for you as quickly as possible. Is next-day delivery to the address on file okay with you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that works.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that ordered for you now. (typing sounds) Okay, so your replacement modem should arrive tomorrow between 8 AM and 6 PM. When it arrives, it's really straightforward—just plug it in and it should automatically activate on our network.

Customer: Alright. Do I need to do anything with this broken one?

Agent: Good question. So there will be a prepaid return label in the box with your new modem. You'll just pop this one in a box and drop it off at any carrier location. We'll take care of the rest.

Customer: Got it. Anything else I need to know?

Agent: Nope, I think that covers it. I've added a credit to your account for the service interruption, so you'll see that reflected on your next bill. And I'm really sorry for the inconvenience today.

Customer: Alright, thanks. I appreciate you trying to fix it anyway.

Agent: Of course! If you have any issues when the new modem arrives, or if you need anything else, just give us a call back. We're here twenty-four seven.

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome! Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
