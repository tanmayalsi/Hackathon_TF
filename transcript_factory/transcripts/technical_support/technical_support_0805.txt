# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, uh, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the router and everything, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm showing your account here under... David Martinez, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet went down about an hour ago. Have you experienced any outages recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, first time really. I mean, I've had it for like two years now and it's been pretty solid. This just happened out of nowhere.

Agent: Okay, understood. So you've already tried unplugging the router—that's a good first step. Just to walk through some basic troubleshooting, have you checked the cables going into your modem? Sometimes they can come loose.

Customer: Um, let me... (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. The cables look pretty secure to me. There's the one from the wall and then the one going to the router.

Agent: Perfect. And what color lights are you seeing on your modem right now?

Customer: Uh... (pause) mostly red? No wait, there's a green light on top, but like... the middle ones are red or orange, I'm not sure.

Agent: Okay, so we've got a green light which is good, but those red or orange lights typically indicate a connection issue. Let me ask you this—when you look at the back of the modem, do you see the cable coming from the wall? The coaxial cable?

Customer: Yeah, I see it.

Agent: Can you check and see if it's hand-tight? Sometimes these can loosen up over time.

Customer: (pause, shuffling sounds) Oh, huh. Actually, I think... I think this one might be a little loose. Let me just... (grunting sounds) try tightening it up.

Agent: Good, good. Go ahead and tighten that for me, and then we'll give it about thirty seconds to reboot.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I tightened it. It's pretty snug now.

Agent: Perfect. And let's just wait here... (pause) how are those lights looking now?

Customer: Still... still the same. Red and orange. Maybe a tiny bit brighter green now, but...

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try a different approach. Let's do a full power cycle on the modem. Can you unplug the power cable from the back of the modem?

Customer: Yeah, doing that now.

Agent: Great. Just leave it unplugged for about sixty seconds while I check something on my end here. (typing sounds) Can you tell me if you've had any recent storms in your area? Anything like that?

Customer: No, not really. It's been pretty nice actually.

Agent: Alright. And you haven't made any changes to your setup recently? No new equipment or anything?

Customer: No, no. Everything's been the same.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug that modem back in for me.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Plugging it back in now. (pause) It's booting back up...

Agent: And we'll give it about a minute to fully restart. Just watch those lights and let me know what you're seeing.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... I'm getting the green light on top, which is good, but... yeah, those orange lights are still there in the middle. Is that... is that bad?

Agent: That typically means the modem isn't establishing a connection with our network. Let me check on the line side here to see if there's an issue on our end. (typing sounds, pause) Hmm... I'm not showing any active outages in your area, and your modem is connecting to us, but your connection is pretty unstable. 

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. Could be a line issue, could be your modem is starting to go bad, or it could be something with the connection coming into your house. Let me try one more thing here. Can you access the modem's settings through your computer while it's plugged in?

Customer: Um... I don't think so? I'm on my phone right now because, you know, no internet on the computer.

Agent: Right, right. Okay, so—do you have mobile data?

Customer: Yeah, I got cell service.

Agent: Can you try going to 192.168.0.1 in your phone's browser and see if you can pull up the modem interface?

Customer: (pause, shuffling) Okay, let me try that... typing in the... (pause) No, it's just saying connection failed or whatever.

Agent: (pause) Alright. That tells me the modem isn't responding properly. Given everything we've tried here—the cable check, the power cycle, checking the connection status—I think what we're looking at is either a modem hardware issue or possibly a line problem that's going to need professional diagnosis.

Customer: So... what do I do?

Agent: Well, I can schedule a technician to come out and take a look. They'll be able to test the line coming into your house and also check if the modem is the culprit. Would you be available for a technician visit?

Customer: How long is that gonna take? To get someone out here?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) I'm showing we have availability... looks like earliest would be tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? Yeah, that works. I just... I was hoping we could fix this today, you know?

Agent: I understand, and I really wish I could get you back online right now. Unfortunately, without a technician being able to physically test the line and equipment, we can't pinpoint the exact issue. But they should be able to get you up and running fairly quickly tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Let's do that then.

Agent: Perfect. So I have you down for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM. A technician will be reaching out to you about thirty minutes before they arrive at your address. Is the phone number on file—555-0147—still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. I'm sending you a confirmation email right now. You should see that within a few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I hope so too. I apologize again for the inconvenience. We really appreciate your business with Frontier, and we'll get you back online as soon as we can.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
