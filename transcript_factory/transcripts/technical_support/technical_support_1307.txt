Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out completely about an hour ago, and I can't get it back up. I've got work from home stuff I need to do, so...

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account here for a... Robert Martinez?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. I've got your service address on file here. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Is your modem powered on right now?

Customer: Yeah, I mean... it's on. The power light is on, but nothing else is lighting up. Like, normally I see the internet light blinking, and that's not happening.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So the power is on but you're not seeing activity lights. Let me have you do a quick power cycle. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, doing that now.

Agent: Perfect. Let that sit for about 30 seconds, and while we're waiting... has anything changed with your setup recently? Any storms, power outages, anything like that?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of. It was working fine this morning when I logged into my work calls. Then I went to grab some lunch and when I came back, nothing.

Agent: Alright, and are you using just the modem we provided, or do you have a separate router as well?

Customer: I've got a router. It's a separate one that I bought myself.

Agent: Got it. And is that router powered on and showing lights?

Customer: Um... (pause) Let me look. Yeah, it's got lights on it. The power light is on and... I think the internet light is on too, actually.

Agent: Okay, so the router seems to be getting some power, but we're not seeing activity from the modem. Go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Give it about a minute to boot back up. While it's doing that, can you tell me if you're seeing any lights on the modem now?

Customer: (pause) Just the power light so far. Give it a second... (longer pause) Nope. Still just the one light. That's weird because usually it boots up pretty quick.

Agent: Yeah, that's... that's not typical. Usually we'd see at least the internet light come on within about 60 seconds or so. Let me ask you something—when you say the internet light isn't on, it's not amber or orange colored, right? Just to make sure we're not seeing a connection issue versus it being completely offline.

Customer: No, it's definitely off. It's dark. Completely dark.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm. Okay, Robert. Let me just check something on my end. (pause) I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, so it's likely an issue with the modem itself or the connection coming into your home. Do you see a cable connection on the back of the modem? The coax cable?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's plugged in.

Agent: Can you check if it's... I know this sounds basic, but just see if it's finger-tight? Sometimes they can come loose.

Customer: (pause) I'm checking... it feels pretty snug to me. I don't think that's it.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else. Can you try unplugging the cable from the modem, just the coax cable, and then plugging it back in? Make sure you hear it click.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, unplugging it now... (click sound) Okay, and plugging it back in... (pause, click) Yeah, it's in there.

Agent: Good. Now power cycle the modem one more time. Unplug it from power.

Customer: (unplugging sound) Done.

Agent: Let's wait 30 seconds this time. (pause) So you mentioned you work from home—are you able to use your mobile hotspot as a backup while we troubleshoot this?

Customer: I could, I guess, but I've got limited data. Plus my work stuff requires like... pretty stable connection. Video calls and everything.

Agent: I understand. That's tough. (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: (plugging sound) Plugging it back in now.

Agent: And let's watch it for a couple minutes this time. (pause) Is anything happening?

Customer: (pause) Power light came on again... I'm waiting... (longer pause) ...still just the power light. This is really not working.

Agent: I know this is frustrating. We're going to figure this out. Unfortunately, what we're seeing here—modem completely unresponsive except for power—this typically indicates either a hardware failure with the modem itself, or possibly a line issue coming into your house that the modem can't detect.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, the troubleshooting we've done suggests we might need to get a technician out to your location. They can check the line coming into your home and possibly swap out the modem if it's defective.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet today if possible.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... (pause) The earliest we have available is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. I wish I had something sooner for you.

Customer: (sighs) Tomorrow morning? I mean... I guess that's better than nothing, but I'm going to be down all day today.

Agent: I apologize for that. Unfortunately with same-day appointments, it really depends on where you're at in the service queue. Can I ask—do you have anywhere you could go today if you absolutely need internet access? A library, coffee shop, or...?

Customer: I mean... maybe. This is just really inconvenient.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me go ahead and get you scheduled for that tomorrow morning appointment. And I'm going to make a note here that this appears to be a potential hardware issue so the technician knows what to expect when they arrive.

Customer: Okay, thank you, I guess.

Agent: And just to cover our bases, one more thing—sometimes the issue can actually be with the router interfering. When the technician arrives tomorrow, you might want to have them test with the modem directly connected to your computer just to isolate any router issues.

Customer: Yeah, I can do that.

Agent: Perfect. So I've got you down for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM. You'll get a courtesy call about 30 minutes before the technician arrives. Is the number we have on file the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Excellent. And Robert, I'm going to put a $25 credit on your account for today's service interruption. That should show up on your next bill.

Customer: Oh, okay. Well, I appreciate that, I guess.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully this gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: We'll make sure of it. Thanks for your patience, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
