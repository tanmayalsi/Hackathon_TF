# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem a few times but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Let me just pull up your account here real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this for the address on Oak Ridge Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned you've already unplugged the modem. That's a good first step. When you plugged it back in, did you wait for all the lights to come back on before trying to connect?

Customer: Yeah, I waited like... I don't know, a couple minutes each time. All the lights came back on like they normally do, but I still can't get online.

Agent: Okay, and when you say all the lights come on, can you tell me which lights you're seeing? Are you looking at the modem right now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it. Um, there's a power light, it's solid green. There's one that says "Internet" and that one's... actually, wait. That one's blinking red.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The red blinking light on the Internet port usually means there's no signal coming in from our network side. Before we go further, let me just check if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds, pause) I'm not seeing any active outages reported right now. Let me ask you this—do you see a cable connection from the wall to your modem?

Customer: Yeah, it's all plugged in. I checked that already.

Agent: Good. And, um, is the cable firmly seated? Sometimes they can get a little loose without you really noticing.

Customer: (pause) Let me... yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and check it. (background noise of movement) It seems pretty tight to me, but let me try unplugging it and plugging it back in.

Agent: That's a great idea. Go ahead and do that, and then wait about 30 seconds before we see if things come back online.

Customer: (background noise, pause) Okay, I'm unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, now I'm plugging it back in. (pause, pause) Okay, I'm waiting... it's coming back on... the power light's on... (pause) No, the Internet light is still red. Still blinking red.

Agent: Hmm, okay. And this started happening about an hour ago, you said? Did anything happen before it went out? Like a storm, or a power outage, or...?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine and then suddenly it wasn't. I was streaming something and it just... froze and then I lost connection.

Agent: Alright. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds, pause) I'm looking at your modem here and I'm not seeing an active signal coming through to it. That could indicate either an issue with the line coming into your house or... (pause) ...it could be something with the modem itself. 

Let me try one more thing with you. I'm going to send a reboot signal to your modem directly from here. It should take about a minute or so to cycle through. Just keep an eye on those lights for me.

Customer: Okay, I got it. I'm watching it.

Agent: (typing sounds) And the reboot should be initiating right now.

Customer: Okay, the lights just went off and now they're coming back on. Still... (pause) ...still blinking red on the Internet light.

Agent: (sigh) Okay, I'm not having any luck from my end either. You know what, let me be honest with you—that red blinking Internet light combined with no signal on our end usually means we're either looking at an issue with the outside line, or the modem itself might have developed a fault. 

I think the best course of action here is to get a technician out to your location to physically inspect the line and check your equipment. Would you be available sometime this week?

Customer: Um, I work during the day. Would they have to come during business hours?

Agent: Actually, we have some availability in the evening. I'm showing... let me see here... (typing sounds) ...we have openings Thursday between 4 and 6 PM, or Friday between 5 and 7 PM. Do either of those work for you?

Customer: Thursday evening works better for me. Four to six is fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule that appointment for Thursday, the 14th, between 4 and 6 PM. The technician will assess the line coming into your home and test your modem. Is that address still 247 Oak Ridge Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. And just to confirm, is there someone who'll be home during that window?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be there.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation email and text message shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Hopefully the tech can figure it out.

Agent: I understand your frustration, and I really appreciate your patience with me today. We'll get this resolved for you on Thursday. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and I apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
