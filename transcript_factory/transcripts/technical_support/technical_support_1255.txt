Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I have work calls coming up in like an hour.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I definitely understand how frustrating that is. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got you here. I'm seeing an account for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Robert. So you're experiencing no internet service at all right now?

Customer: Right, nothing. My router—the little box you guys installed—it's just completely dark. No lights at all.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let's start with the basics. Can you check if your modem and router are plugged in? Sometimes they can accidentally get unplugged.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. Let me... (background noise) ...yeah, they're both plugged in. The power cord is definitely in the wall outlet.

Agent: Good. And do you see a power outlet nearby that maybe has a switch on it? Sometimes those are switched off.

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) ...no, I don't think so. This is my desk and I can see... no, there's no switch on it.

Agent: Alright. So the modem and router are both completely dark with no lights on them at all?

Customer: Correct. Nothing. It's like they're not getting any power, but they're plugged in.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me try something. Can you unplug the modem—that's the box directly from our network—unplug that for about 30 seconds, then plug it back in?

Customer: Sure, give me a second. (background noise) ...okay, unplugging it now.

Agent: Perfect. Just wait about 30 seconds and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) ...alright, plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, and now...? It's still completely dark, Derek. No lights.

Agent: Hmm. No lights at all, not even like a power indicator light?

Customer: No. Nothing. Dead.

Agent: Okay, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Robert, I'm not seeing any service issues in your area right now. The line shows as active. Can you tell me—when was the last time you actually had internet service working?

Customer: Um, this morning around maybe 7 AM? I was checking my email and everything was fine. Then I went to grab coffee and when I came back like 15 minutes later, everything was off.

Agent: Got it. So it was working this morning. And you haven't had any power issues in your home? Like power outages or anything like that?

Customer: No, no. Everything else is fine. The lights in my house are all working. It's just this stuff.

Agent: Right, okay. So it seems like it might be a power issue specific to the modem and router. Let me try one more thing. Can you try plugging them into a different outlet? Maybe one that's in a different part of the room?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I can try that. (background noise, sounds of moving) Okay, so I'm going to unplug this... and I'm moving over to an outlet by the window. (more background noise) ...plugging in the modem here. (pause) ...still nothing. Still no lights.

Agent: Still nothing?

Customer: No. This is really strange.

Agent: I agree. That's unusual. Okay, let me ask you this—do you have any battery backup devices or power strips in use?

Customer: Power strips? Um, yeah, actually. Let me see... (pause) ...I'm using one of those. Should I not be?

Agent: Well, not necessarily, but let me have you try plugging the modem directly into the wall outlet, bypassing the power strip entirely.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, unplugging from the strip... (pause) ...and plugging directly into the outlet. (pause) Still nothing, Derek. I'm not seeing any lights come on.

Agent: (pause) Alright. And you're certain the outlet itself is working? Like, do you have a lamp or something you can plug in to test it?

Customer: Oh, that's a good idea. Let me grab my phone charger. (background noise) I'm plugging it in... yeah, it's charging. So the outlet works fine.

Agent: Okay, so the outlet is definitely active. At this point, Robert, I'm thinking it might be a hardware issue with the modem itself. Let me check if we have any incidents reported or anything else that might be causing this. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any outages, but let me put you on a brief hold while I check with my supervisor on the next best steps. It'll just be a moment.

Customer: Okay, no problem.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Okay, Robert, I'm back. I spoke with my supervisor. We believe your modem may have had a power surge or is experiencing a hardware failure. Before we get a replacement sent out to you, I want to try one more remote diagnostic. Are you able to restart your computer right now?

Customer: Yeah, I can do that. Why, will that help?

Agent: It's possible. Sometimes a reboot can help identify any connectivity issues. Let me walk you through it.

Customer: Alright, restarting now. (pause) (background noise) Okay, it's booting back up.

Agent: (typing sounds) And can you wait until it's fully loaded and then... actually, Robert, I'm realizing we won't be able to test much without the modem powering on. The issue is really on the hardware side. (pause) I'm sorry, I know this isn't the answer you were hoping for.

Customer: So you're saying the modem is just... broken?

Agent: That's what it appears to be, yes. I wish I had better news. The fact that it's completely unresponsive and there's no power indicator at all, even after trying multiple outlets and a power cycle, really points to a hardware failure.

Customer: (sighs) This is really frustrating. I have that call in less than an hour.

Agent: I completely understand, and I sincerely apologize. Here's what we can do—I can expedite a replacement modem to you. Normally shipping takes 3 to 5 business days, but I can flag this as urgent and get it out first thing tomorrow. You should receive it by 10 AM or so.

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't you... I mean, is there any way to get it faster? Like today?

Agent: I wish we could, Robert. Unfortunately, same-day delivery isn't available in your area. But I can arrange for the expedited shipment and also see if there are any local retail locations where you might be able to pick up a compatible model, though I'd need to check inventory.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Okay, let me think about this. Can I call back after my work call and see what options there are?

Agent: Absolutely. Or actually, let me get you an authorization number for the replacement modem right now, and I can have that shipped out to you immediately so it arrives tomorrow. You can always arrange to have it picked up locally if that option becomes available. What do you think?

Customer: Yeah, okay. That makes sense.

Agent: Perfect. Let me process that for you now. (typing sounds) Your replacement modem authorization number is... 887-FIR-2024-4156. You should receive a tracking email within the next 30 minutes or so.

Customer: Okay, got it. 887-FIR-2024-4156.

Agent: Exactly. And Robert, I'm really sorry about this. I know it's inconvenient timing.

Customer: Yeah, well. Thanks for trying anyway, Derek. I guess I'll just have to figure something out for this call.

Agent: I appreciate your patience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... that's about it, I guess.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. You should have that modem tomorrow. If you run into any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to us again.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Have a good day, Robert.

Customer: You too.
