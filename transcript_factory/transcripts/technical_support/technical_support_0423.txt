# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I have your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I'm seeing an account for... David Martinez, is that correct?

Customer: That's right.

Agent: Perfect. So your internet service went down this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router? Are they powered on?

Customer: Um, yeah, so the modem—it's got the power light on, but the internet light isn't lit up. It's like, completely dark.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. And your router, do you see any lights on that one?

Customer: (pause) The router's on too, but yeah, same thing. The internet light isn't doing anything.

Agent: Alright, let's do a quick restart. Can you unplug the modem from the power for me? Just pull the plug out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about thirty seconds while that fully powers down. (pause) Are you there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugged back in... and we're waiting. (pause) Okay, the power light came back on.

Agent: Good. Now we're gonna give it about two minutes to fully boot back up and establish a connection. While we wait, let me ask—did anything change with your setup recently? Any storms, power outages, or anything like that?

Customer: No, not really. I mean, there was some wind last night but nothing crazy. This is totally random.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright. Is that internet light on the modem showing anything yet? Any green or amber lights?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. The power's on but that internet light is completely off.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check if there's any service disruption in your area. (pause) I'm not seeing any active outages on our end. Let's try the restart on the router as well. Can you unplug that and give it the same treatment?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Okay, unplugged.

Agent: Let's wait another thirty seconds, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it in... (pause) It's back on now.

Agent: Okay, let's give that a couple minutes again. (pause) While that's booting up, can I ask—are you using the modem and router combo we provided, or do you have your own equipment?

Customer: It's the combo unit you guys gave me when I signed up, so... it's been working fine up until today.

Agent: Right. And you haven't had any issues with it before?

Customer: Nope, it's been solid. Really good speed too.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let's check on those lights again. Anything showing up on the modem now?

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. Still just the power light.

Agent: Okay, and the router?

Customer: Same story. Just power.

Agent: Let me have you try one more thing. I'm going to need you to locate the reset button on the back of the modem. It's usually a small, recessed button.

Customer: The reset button? (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's really tiny.

Agent: Right, it's tiny on purpose. Now, I'm going to warn you—if you press this, it's going to reset the modem to factory settings, so you might lose your saved Wi-Fi network and we'd need to set that back up. But given what we're seeing, I think we need to try it.

Customer: Okay, um... (pause) You sure that's gonna help?

Agent: It might, yeah. It clears out any configuration issues that could be causing this. Let's give it a shot.

Customer: Alright, going for it. (pause) Holding down the button... (pause) Okay, I pressed it and everything's blinking now.

Agent: That's actually good. That means it's resetting. Let's give it a minute or so to cycle through that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so like... how long do I wait?

Agent: Give it about a minute. Just watch for the lights to stabilize. (pause) Is anything settling down yet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the power light came back on steady... but I'm still not seeing that internet light.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Let me check something on the line here. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm. (pause) David, I'm looking at your modem status and it's actually showing as completely offline on our end. It's not registering any signal at all.

Customer: Oh, great. So like... what does that mean?

Agent: That typically means there's either a line issue or the modem itself might be failing. Let me check the physical line for you. (pause) Can you hear me?

Customer: Yeah, I'm still here.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing some troubling diagnostics on your line. The modem should be registering and it's just... not showing up in our system at all. At this point, I think we might be looking at either a modem replacement or a technician visit to check the line itself.

Customer: A technician visit? How long is that gonna take?

Agent: (pause) Let me check availability... (typing sounds) The earliest I'm showing is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. But I do want to try one more thing before we go that route.

Customer: Okay, what's that?

Agent: Can you check where the line comes into your house? Usually it's outside, near the foundation or wherever your house connects to our network. Do you know where that is?

Customer: (pause) Uh, I think there's something on the side of my house, behind the shed. Let me... let me go look real quick.

Agent: Sure thing. (pause) [inaudible background noise as customer moves]

Customer: Okay, I'm back. So there's a box here and there's like a cable coming out of it going into my house.

Agent: Perfect. Can you see if that cable is connected tightly? Sometimes they can come loose.

Customer: (pause) It's pretty snug... looks connected to me.

Agent: Alright. And is there any visible damage to the cable? Any cuts, nicks, anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Not that I can see... it looks fine from what I can tell.

Agent: Okay. And you're not seeing any water damage or anything around that box?

Customer: No, it looks pretty dry.

Agent: Alright, let me... (typing sounds) (pause) You know what, I think at this point we're gonna need to get a tech out there. The modem isn't responding to any of our commands from this end, which means either the connection is completely severed or the modem has failed internally. Unfortunately, I can't troubleshoot further from here.

Customer: (sighs) So you're saying I just... I'm just without internet until tomorrow?

Agent: I know that's frustrating, and I'm really sorry. But the good news is we do have that availability tomorrow morning. And if it's just a line issue, typically that's a quick fix. If it's the modem, we'll replace that for you at no charge.

Customer: Okay, so... do I need to do anything?

Agent: No, just be home between 8 AM and noon. The technician will handle everything. And I'm going to go ahead and add a credit to your account for today, since you've been without service. You should see that show up on your next bill.

Customer: Yeah, I appreciate that. (pause) So just to confirm—tomorrow between 8 and noon?

Agent: That's right. And David, I apologize we couldn't get this resolved tonight. I know it's a hassle, especially when you're working from home.

Customer: Yeah, well, I appreciate you trying anyway. I guess I'll be using my phone hotspot tonight.

Agent: Okay, sounds good. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's... that's everything. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, David. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll get you back online tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
