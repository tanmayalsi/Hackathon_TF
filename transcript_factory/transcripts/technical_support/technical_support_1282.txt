Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, uh, my internet isn't working. I've had service with you guys for like three years now and this is the first real problem I've had, but it just went out this morning.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get this sorted out. Let me just pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing an account for... is this James Patterson?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, James. So your internet went out this morning, you said? Do you have any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, let me go look at it. (pause) It's in the hallway closet. Okay, so... the modem, it's got a red light on it. Like, everything's red right now.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing red lights. That typically indicates either a connection issue or a power issue. Can you tell me... is the power cable plugged in firmly on both ends?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, it looks plugged in to me. Let me... (pause) yeah, it's definitely in the outlet and in the modem.

Agent: Good. And what about the coaxial cable? That's the thicker cable that comes from the wall into the modem. Is that connected securely?

Customer: (pause) Hold on, I'm looking at it. Yeah, that one's connected too. Both of them look fine to me.

Agent: Alright. What I'm going to suggest is we do a hard restart. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet?

Customer: Okay. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Just leave that unplugged for about thirty seconds. That'll give everything time to reset. While we wait, did anything happen this morning before the internet went out? Like a storm or a power outage?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine when I went to bed last night. I just woke up and tried to check my email and there was nothing.

Agent: Got it. (pause) Okay, thirty seconds should be up. Go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) It's... hmm. The lights are still all red.

Agent: Still red, okay. Um, give it just a minute to fully boot up. Sometimes it takes a little bit to establish the connection again. What you're looking for is a green light, typically on the "Internet" or "Online" indicator.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, nothing's changed. Still all red. It's been like a minute now.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let me check something on our end here. (typing sounds) I'm pulling up your modem status... Hmm. I'm actually showing that your modem is offline in our system. That could mean the signal isn't reaching it from our network. Have you noticed any physical damage to the coaxial cable where it enters your wall?

Customer: Uh... no, I don't think so? I mean, I'm not really crawling around looking at cables, but nothing looks obviously wrong to me.

Agent: I understand. Let me try one more thing. Can you locate the reset button on your modem? It's usually a small, recessed button.

Customer: (pause) Um... I think I see it? It's like, on the back?

Agent: Yes, on the back. If you could press and hold that for about ten seconds, that will completely reset the modem to factory settings. We can reconfigure it after. Just... be aware that you might need to restart any connected devices too.

Customer: Okay, I'm holding it. (pause) Ten seconds, right? (pause) Okay, I'm letting go. (pause) Hmm, the lights are doing something different now. There's like a blue light that's starting to blink, and... no, wait. Now it's back to red again.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so we had a blue blinking light, which is actually... that's a good sign. That means it was trying to connect. But then it went back to red?

Customer: Yeah, it's just solid red now.

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) James, I'm looking at a few things here. We may actually have a service issue in your area. When did you say this started exactly?

Customer: This morning, like around eight o'clock when I woke up.

Agent: And I'm showing... let me just check the service map here... (pause) there's actually been some reports in your area. But James, I also want to rule out... sometimes the issue can be with the line coming into your house. Do you have any other devices from us, like a phone line or anything?

Customer: No, just the internet. I use my cell phone.

Agent: Okay, got it. (pause) Alright, so here's what I'm thinking. The reset attempt brought up the blue light, which means your modem is trying to sync with our network, but then it's dropping. That could be a few things—it could be our signal, or it could be something with the line at your house. Unfortunately, I'm not able to fully troubleshoot that remotely.

Customer: What do you mean? Like, there's nothing else we can try?

Agent: Well, I have a couple more things. Have you tried a different outlet? Sometimes the power outlet itself can be the issue.

Customer: Oh, I didn't think about that. Um, let me unplug it and try the living room outlet. (pause) Okay, it's plugged in over here now. (pause) Still red.

Agent: Okay, still red. I understand this is frustrating. Let me see what options we have for you. (typing sounds, pause) What I'm going to do is I'm going to schedule a technician to come out to your home to physically inspect the line and your equipment. They'll be able to do a more thorough diagnostic. How does your schedule look? We can get someone out there tomorrow or the day after.

Customer: Tomorrow? Really? How early?

Agent: We have a window between nine AM and one PM tomorrow if that works for you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess. I'll have to rearrange some things, but I mean, I need my internet.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. The technician will have all your information, and they'll give you a call about an hour before they arrive. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you troubleshoot?

Customer: I mean... I don't know. Can't you like, send a signal or something to reset it from your end?

Agent: That's actually a great question. Let me try that. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm sending a remote reset to your modem now. Let's see... (pause) Can you let me know if any of the lights change?

Customer: (pause) Uh... no. Still the same. Red.

Agent: Okay, unfortunately that didn't work either. That tells me it's likely not communicating with our network properly, which is why I think the technician visit is really our best bet at this point. (pause) Have you got a pen handy? Let me give you the confirmation number for your appointment.

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (pause) Okay, ready.

Agent: Great. Your confirmation number is 784521. That's 7-8-4-5-2-1. And again, we're looking at tomorrow between nine AM and one PM. The tech will call you an hour beforehand.

Customer: Alright. I got it. So... do you think it's gonna be something expensive to fix?

Agent: I really can't say for certain until the technician gets there and diagnoses it. If it's our equipment or our line, there shouldn't be any charge to you. If it's something else, we'll discuss options with you at that time. Is there anything else I can help clarify?

Customer: No, I think that's... yeah, I think that's everything.

Agent: Alright, James. I appreciate your patience today. I'm sorry we weren't able to get you back online remotely, but hopefully the technician can resolve this tomorrow. You've got that confirmation number, 784521. Is there anything else I can help with?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll get you back up and running as soon as we can. Have a great day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
