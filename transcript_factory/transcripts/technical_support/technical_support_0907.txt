Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've got no idea what's going on. I need to get this fixed ASAP.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. And you're saying your internet went down this morning?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 7 or 8 AM. I tried unplugging the router, waiting like five minutes, and plugging it back in, but nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, well that's a good first step. Let me ask you a few questions here. Do you have power to your modem right now? Can you see any lights on it?

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, let me... let me look at it. It's in the corner over there. Okay, so I see... there's a power light and it's on, but the internet light is off. Is that bad?

Agent: Okay, so the power light is on but the internet light is off. That's actually helpful information. That tells me the modem is getting power but it's not connecting to the network. Let's try a few things. Can you locate the reset button on the modem? It's usually a small button you'd need to press with a pin or paperclip.

Customer: Reset button? I... I don't know if I see one. There's a lot of little buttons and ports on the back here.

Agent: It might be recessed into the device, so you'd need something small like a paperclip to press it. But before we do a full reset, let me check something on our end first. (typing sounds) One moment please.

Customer: (background noise, customer breathing) Okay, sure.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm not seeing any outages in your area, so that's good news. The signal is coming to your house. Um, what I'd like to do is have you check the cables. Can you follow the cable from the wall outlet where it connects to your modem?

Customer: The cable from the wall? Yeah, I can see that. It's... it looks plugged in pretty good to me.

Agent: Okay. And on the modem side, is it securely connected there as well?

Customer: I mean, it looks like it. I don't know, should I try unplugging it and plugging it back in?

Agent: Sure, that's worth a try. Go ahead and disconnect that cable from the modem, wait about ten seconds, and then reconnect it firmly.

Customer: (sounds of movement, cable unplugging) Okay, ten seconds... (pause) ...alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) Hmm. Still nothing. The light's still off.

Agent: Okay. No change there. (pause) Let me try something else. I'm going to send a signal to your modem to see if I can restart it remotely. This should just take a moment here. (typing sounds)

Customer: Okay, should I be looking at anything specific?

Agent: Just watch the lights on the modem. You might see them flicker or blink when I do this.

Customer: (pause) I see... okay, yeah, they're flickering. The power light went off and came back on. But the internet light is still... (pause) ...still off.

Agent: Still off, okay. That's... hmm. (pause) Alright, let me check one more thing here. Do you remember when your internet was last working properly?

Customer: It was working fine yesterday. I was streaming Netflix last night, no problems at all. Then I woke up this morning and it was just... gone.

Agent: Understood. And you haven't had any storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The power's been steady.

Agent: Okay. (pause, typing sounds) You know what, I want to try one more thing before we escalate this. Let me have you do a full factory reset on the modem. This will clear everything, so we'll need to set it up again, but it might get things working.

Customer: Will that, like, erase my passwords and stuff?

Agent: Yes, it will reset everything to factory defaults, so you'll need to set up your WiFi network again when we're done. Let me walk you through it. You're going to hold down that reset button for about 15 to 20 seconds.

Customer: The reset button that I couldn't find before? (laughs)

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, I know, I know. It's in there somewhere. Look closely at the back of the modem. You should see it near the power port usually.

Customer: (pause, sounds of searching) Okay... I think I found it. There's a little sunken button here. I'm going to use a pen to push it.

Agent: Perfect.

Customer: (sounds of button pressing) Okay, I'm holding it. Is something supposed to happen?

Agent: The lights might go crazy for a moment, flashing on and off. Just keep holding it for about fifteen to twenty seconds total.

Customer: (pause) Okay... they're doing that flickering thing. How much longer?

Agent: You can let go now.

Customer: (button releases) Okay, I let go. Now what?

Agent: Now we're going to wait about three to five minutes for the modem to fully reboot and reinitialize. It should go through its startup sequence again.

Customer: (pause) So I just... wait?

Agent: Yes, just give it a few minutes. The internet light should come back on during this time if everything is working properly.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm watching it. (long pause) It's been like... a minute or so. The light's still off. The power light is on, but...

Agent: Give it a couple more minutes. These things can take a bit sometimes.

Customer: (very long pause) ...Still nothing. It's been like four minutes now.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Okay, I'm going to be honest with you here. This typically means there's either an issue with the modem itself, or there's a problem with the line coming to your house that's preventing it from connecting to our network. Since my remote restart didn't work and the factory reset didn't restore the connection either, this is beyond what I can troubleshoot from here.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long is it going to take to fix this?

Agent: Well, what I'd like to do is schedule a technician to come out and take a look at your setup. They can test the line and check your equipment to see what's actually going on.

Customer: When can someone come out? I really need my internet back. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds, pause) I'm showing we can get someone out there... it looks like we have an opening tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or the day after tomorrow in the morning between 8 and 12 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon is fine. That works.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, you're all set for tomorrow, July 15th, between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will come by to diagnose the issue and get your internet back up and running. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just hope they can fix it quickly tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sure they'll take good care of you. In the meantime, if anything changes or if the internet suddenly comes back on, just give us a call and we can cancel that appointment. But I have a confirmation number here for you.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: It's 447892. Did you get that?

Customer: 447892. Yeah, I got it.

Agent: Great. I apologize again that we couldn't get this resolved today, but our technician will definitely figure out what's going on. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
