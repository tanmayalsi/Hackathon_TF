# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, my internet's been down since this morning. I've tried unplugging things and plugging them back in, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing an account for Robert Chen at 422 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you're unable to access the internet at all this morning. When exactly did you first notice this?

Customer: I'd say around 7 AM? I went to check my email and nothing was loading. The modem's been plugged in the whole time.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you take a look at your modem for me? I'm looking for a box with some lights on the front. Do you see that?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I see it. It's over there by the router.

Agent: Perfect. What color are the lights on the front of the modem right now?

Customer: Um... there's a red light, I think? And then there's like a green one that's not very bright.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing a red light. That actually tells me something. The red light typically indicates a connection issue. Let's try a power cycle. Can you unplug the modem from the power source?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Done. It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And while we're waiting, can you also unplug the router for me?

Customer: Oh, okay. Yeah, unplugging it now. (pause) Both are unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give it about 30 seconds. I'm just going to stay on the line with you here.

Customer: (pause) How much longer?

Agent: Just about ten more seconds... Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in now.

Agent: Great. Give it just a moment to boot up. You should see some lights starting to come back on. What are you seeing now?

Customer: Um, okay, yeah... there's some lights coming back. I see like an orange one now, and it's kind of... flickering?

Agent: Orange and flickering is actually okay. That means it's trying to establish a connection. Let's go ahead and plug the router back in too.

Customer: (pause) Yep, plugged back in.

Agent: Excellent. Now this might take a minute or two to fully boot up. While we wait, let me ask you—have you had any recent storms in your area? Any weather issues?

Customer: Not really, no. It's been pretty clear. Why?

Agent: Just checking. Sometimes weather can affect the signal coming to your home. (pause) Let me also check on our end if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages on Maple Street, so that's good news.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it means the issue is likely localized to your equipment or your line. Okay, let's check on those lights again. What are you seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Um, they're still orange. Some are blinking, some are solid. But I'm still not getting internet on my computer.

Agent: Alright, let's try connecting a device directly to the modem with an ethernet cable. Do you have one of those available?

Customer: I... I think I might have one around here somewhere. (pause) Yeah, I found one. Let me plug my laptop in directly.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and do that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's connected. (pause) Nope, still nothing.

Agent: Hmm. No connection showing up at all?

Customer: No, I got nothing. The network's not even showing up.

Agent: Okay, let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) (pause) Robert, I'm showing that we're detecting your modem on our network, which is... actually that's weird. (pause) The modem is showing as online here, but you're not getting a connection on your end?

Customer: That doesn't make sense. What does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It might be an issue with the modem itself, or possibly something with the line coming into your house. (pause) Let me try restarting your modem from our system here.

Customer: Oh, okay. (pause) Um, when you do that, will I lose my... I mean, should I do anything?

Agent: No, just stay on the line. You might see the lights go through a reset cycle, but just stay on the line with me. (typing sounds) Alright, initiating the restart now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I see the lights going crazy now. They're all blinking.

Agent: That's normal. That's part of the restart sequence. Give it about another 30 to 45 seconds.

Customer: (pause) (pause) Okay, they're settling down again.

Agent: What color are they now?

Customer: Still orange. A couple are blinking. One or two are solid. Um... (pause) ...no internet.

Agent: Alright, still nothing?

Customer: No, nothing.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm going to be honest with you, Robert. This is pointing to either a hardware issue with the modem or something with the physical line coming into your home. I've done what I can on our end, and I'm not seeing any errors in our system.

Customer: So you're saying my modem might be broken?

Agent: It's possible. It could also be a line issue, which would require a technician to come out and check. Unfortunately, those aren't things I can fully diagnose over the phone.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet.

Agent: I completely understand. We do have technicians available, but the earliest appointment I'm seeing is tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sighs) I guess it has to. Let me check my calendar real quick. Yeah, I can do that.

Agent: Great. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to get a technician out to 422 Maple Street tomorrow, March 14th, between noon and 4 PM. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. Do you know how much this is going to cost me?

Agent: The service call itself is $99, but if it turns out to be a line issue on our end, that wouldn't be charged to you. If it's your modem, you have a few options—you can replace it with one of ours, or [inaudible].

Customer: Okay, well... I guess I'll wait and see what the technician says.

Agent: That's probably your best bet. I'm really sorry we couldn't get you up and running today, Robert.

Customer: Yeah, me too. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: Of course. You're all set for tomorrow. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive. Is this number the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yes, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. I've also sent a confirmation email to the address we have on file. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for choosing Frontier, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
