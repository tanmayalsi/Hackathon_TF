Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried restarting the router and everything. Nothing's working.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I've got your account here. Looks like you're in the Riverside area on our fiber service. And you're saying the internet went down this morning?

Customer: Yeah, like around 8 AM I noticed it. I've been working from home and suddenly just... nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Okay. And you mentioned you already restarted the router. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is there any lights on the modem or the router?

Customer: Um, let me look. (pause) Okay, so on the router there's like... the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light, the one that's supposed to be blue or whatever, it's not on at all. It's just off.

Agent: Alright, that's actually helpful information. That tells me the modem might not be getting a signal from our network. What I'd like you to do is unplug the modem for me—that's the device connected to your wall outlet, usually near your router.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's right there. (pause) Unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. Let that sit for about thirty seconds while I check some things on my end.

Customer: (pause) You there?

Agent: Yeah, I'm still here. Just pulling up your line here. How's that thirty seconds coming?

Customer: Yeah, pretty much right now. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Perfect timing. Go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Alright, it's booting back up. All the lights are coming on and... hmm. (pause) No, still no internet light.

Agent: Still no internet light?

Customer: No. The power's on, but that internet light is still dark.

Agent: Okay. So I'm looking at our systems here and I'm not seeing your connection coming back online from our end. That's interesting. Have there been any recent storms in your area? Sometimes that can affect the line coming into your house.

Customer: No, no storms. I mean, it rained a little yesterday but nothing crazy. It's been pretty clear today.

Agent: Okay. And just to cover all the bases here—is there anything physically wrong with the cables? Like, do you see any visible damage to the lines coming into your house?

Customer: (pause) Uh, let me check. I'll have to go look at the outside. Hold on.

Agent: Sure, take your time.

Customer: (pause) (background noise of door opening) Okay, so the cable looks fine from what I can see. It's connected where it comes in and... yeah, it looks normal to me.

Agent: Alright. And everything looks secure?

Customer: Yeah, I think so.

Agent: Okay. Let me try something else here. I'm going to send a signal down the line to your modem to see if that brings it back. Can you watch the lights for a moment and let me know if anything changes?

Customer: (pause) (typing sounds from agent's end) Watching... watching... (long pause) Nope. Nothing's different. Still the same as before.

Agent: Yeah, I'm not seeing any response on my end either. That's... (pause) that's a little concerning. Let me ask you—have you had any service issues in the past, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. It's been pretty solid since we got it installed like... six months ago?

Agent: Six months, okay. And you're definitely not seeing any lights indicating an internet connection?

Customer: Definitely not. I mean, I've unplugged and replugged everything. The router's fine. It's just like... the signal isn't getting there or something.

Agent: Right. Unfortunately, what I'm seeing here is that we're not getting any signal from our network on your line. Normally that would indicate either a problem with the equipment itself or a line issue somewhere between your house and our hub station.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like... is it something I can fix?

Agent: Well, typically at this point we'd want to get a technician out there to investigate further. They can check the line from the pole to your house and test the equipment directly. I know that's not ideal, but given that we're not getting a signal at all, that's really the next step.

Customer: Okay, um... how long does that usually take? Like, can they come out today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability for your area. (pause) What's your address?

Customer: It's 447 Magnolia Drive, Riverside.

Agent: (typing) Okay, I'm checking the schedule... (pause) So, we have some availability but the earliest I'm seeing is... tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need this today. I've got a deadline at work and—

Agent: I completely understand, and I really wish I had something sooner. Let me see... (pause) Unfortunately, today's pretty booked up in your area. It looks like tomorrow afternoon is really the earliest we can get someone out.

Customer: (sigh) Alright. I guess it'll have to be tomorrow. But like, when they get here, they'll be able to fix it, right?

Agent: So, based on what we're troubleshooting, it's most likely either the modem itself has failed or there's an issue with the line. The technician will be able to diagnose exactly what's going on. If it's the modem, we can swap that out for you. If it's a line issue, they'll work on getting that resolved.

Customer: Okay. Alright, let's schedule it for tomorrow then.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get you set up. I've got you down for tomorrow, January 15th, between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive. Is the number they should call the same as the one on your account?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. And you'll want to make sure someone's home to let them in, and if you could have the modem and router accessible, that would be helpful.

Customer: Yep, I'll be here. Thanks... I guess.

Agent: I know this is frustrating. I really do apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get this sorted out tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, we'll see you tomorrow afternoon.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
