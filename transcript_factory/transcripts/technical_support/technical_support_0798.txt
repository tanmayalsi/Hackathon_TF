Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and everything, and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what name is the account under?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 300 plan. Let me just ask you a few quick questions. When you say the internet went out, are you getting any lights on your modem at all?

Customer: Uh, yeah, actually. The power light is on, but like... the internet light, I think it's the one that says "online"? That one's off. It's not lit up.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. And you already tried unplugging the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I unplugged it, waited like a minute, and plugged it back in. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright. Let me walk you through a couple more things. Do you have a gateway or a separate router connected to the modem?

Customer: I've got... I think it's a router? It's a white box, pretty small.

Agent: That's probably our Frontier Gateway. Is that powered on as well?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. The lights on that one are on too, but I'm still not getting internet on my computer or my phone.

Agent: Got it. Okay, so let's try a slightly different approach. I want you to unplug the modem first, then unplug the gateway, and then we'll wait about 30 seconds. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (background noise of things being unplugged) Okay, they're both unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about 30 seconds. (pause) While we're waiting, have you noticed any outages in your area recently?

Customer: Not that I know of. Everything was working fine this morning. I was using it for work, and then around noon it just... died.

Agent: Understood. Okay, it's been about 30 seconds. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first. We'll let that boot up for about a minute.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) The power light came back on.

Agent: Good. Now go ahead and plug the gateway back in as well.

Customer: Okay, plugging it in now. (pause) Alright, it's in.

Agent: Great. Now we're going to give both of those devices about two minutes to fully boot up and connect. While we wait, let me check something on your account. (typing sounds) James, have you had any service issues in the past few months?

Customer: No, nothing. It's been solid. That's actually why I switched to Frontier, you know? The other provider kept going out on me.

Agent: I appreciate that. Okay, so it's been about two minutes now. Are you seeing the online light on the modem yet?

Customer: (pause) Um... no. No, I'm not seeing it. The gateway has lights on, but the modem's still... the online light is still not on.

Agent: Okay, let me try something different. Can you check the back of the modem for me? I want to make sure the ethernet cable that goes from the modem to the wall is plugged in securely.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I'm looking at it. It looks... it looks plugged in to me.

Agent: Can you try unplugging it and plugging it back in? Just give it a firm push.

Customer: Okay... (background noise) Alright, I unplugged it and... (pause) plugged it back in. Should I hear like a click or something?

Agent: You might feel a little resistance, but you shouldn't hear too much. And the cable from the wall to the modem, is that one secure as well?

Customer: Oh, wait. Let me check that one. (pause) Yeah, that one's... that one's actually a little loose. Let me tighten that up.

Agent: Okay, try that.

Customer: (background noise) Alright, it's tightened. Still nothing though. The light's still off.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Um, and you're looking at... just to confirm, the light that says "Online" or "Internet," correct?

Customer: Yeah, the one that says "Online." It's dark. There's no light coming from it at all.

Agent: I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I check a couple of things on our end. It should only be about a minute. Is that alright?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) (40 seconds) Thank you for holding, James. I'm back. So I'm checking our network on this end and I'm not showing any service interruptions at your address, which is 447 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Okay. So it appears the issue might be with the modem itself or potentially with the line coming into your home. I want to try one more thing before we escalate this. Can you restart the modem one more time, but this time, leave it unplugged for a full two minutes?

Customer: Two minutes? That's kind of a long time, but... okay, I can do that.

Agent: I know it seems long, but sometimes that can help reset the connection with our network. Go ahead and unplug it now.

Customer: (background noise) Unplugged. I guess I'll just... wait. (pause) [inaudible] ...browsing on my phone while I wait.

Agent: (typing sounds) Sounds good. Let me know when it's been about two minutes.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, it's been about two minutes.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (background noise) Plugged back in. (pause) Power light came on again... (longer pause) ...and I'm still not seeing the online light. This is... this is really frustrating.

Agent: I understand, James. I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Unfortunately, at this point, it seems like we might be looking at either a modem issue or a line issue that's going to require a technician to come out and take a look. Let me see what we can do for you here.

Customer: How long would that take? I work from home, so I really need to get this fixed soon.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. We typically can get someone out within 24 to 48 hours depending on your area. Given that it's mid-week, we might be able to get someone out tomorrow. Let me schedule that for you. Would tomorrow between 8 AM and noon work?

Customer: Yeah, tomorrow morning is fine. What am I looking at cost-wise for a service call if it's not covered?

Agent: The service call is typically $99, but if it turns out to be an issue on our line or network side, that would be waived. The technician will assess everything and let you know.

Customer: Okay, alright. And is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: Honestly, at this point, I don't want to have you troubleshoot further. Just leave everything as it is, powered on, and the technician will take it from there tomorrow morning. They'll have all the information they need in your account.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate it. So someone will be out tomorrow morning?

Agent: Yes, between 8 AM and noon. We'll send you a confirmation text and email with all the details, including the technician's phone number in case you need to reschedule or contact them. Is the phone number on file still 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell phone. And my email is... it's jmitchell1974 at gmail dot com.

Agent: Perfect. I have that. Is there anything else I can help you with today, James?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying to help troubleshoot.

Agent: You're welcome. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today, but our technician should be able to resolve this tomorrow. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and have a great rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye, James.

Customer: Bye.
