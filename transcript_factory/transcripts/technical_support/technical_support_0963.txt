# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, I'm having trouble with my internet. It just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back online.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... uh... (pause) 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account here. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. Let me ask you a few questions. When you say the internet went out, are you getting any lights on your modem and router at all?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually. The modem has some lights on it, but they're not the usual colors, I think? Like, there's a red light that's just... sitting there. Not blinking or anything.

Agent: Okay, a solid red light typically indicates a connection issue. That's actually really helpful. Can you tell me—do you see a power button on your modem? It should be on the front or the back.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. There's definitely a power button here.

Agent: Great. What I'd like you to do is hold that power button for about ten seconds until the modem completely shuts down. Then wait about thirty seconds and power it back on. Think you can do that?

Customer: Sure, one second. (pause) Okay, I'm holding it down... (pause) ...and it's off. Now I'll wait. (background noise of the customer tapping something) Alright, powering it back on now.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and let me know once you see the lights start to come back on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the lights are... they're coming on. There's a white light, a green light, and... yeah, those are the normal ones I think. (pause) Oh wait, no. Now there's an orange light blinking.

Agent: Okay, the orange blinking light means it's still trying to establish a connection. That should stabilize in another minute or so. While we wait, let me just verify a couple things. Have there been any storms in your area recently, or any work done on the lines?

Customer: No storms that I know of. Uh, I did see some Frontier trucks down the street yesterday doing some maintenance, but I don't think that was on my street.

Agent: Alright, that's good to know. (pause) Okay, so what's the status on those lights now?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...still orange. It's definitely still blinking. Is it supposed to take this long?

Agent: It can take a couple minutes sometimes. Let's give it another thirty seconds or so. In the meantime, can you also check—do you have a secondary router, or just the modem?

Customer: I have both. The router is separate.

Agent: Okay, good. Is the router powered on and lit up?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. The router's got... I think all the normal lights on it.

Agent: Great. (pause) How about now on the modem?

Customer: (pause) ...No, still orange. This is weird. It's been like five minutes now.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Michael, I'm seeing that there may be some network activity on your account that's unusual. Let me check your service status in our system here. (pause) Are you... are you able to try accessing any website on one of your devices? Just to confirm nothing's working?

Customer: Yeah, I'll try. (pause) [inaudible] ...no, nothing. Just says the server can't be reached or whatever.

Agent: Okay, so no internet connectivity at all. (pause) Alright, I'm going to have you try one more thing. I want you to unplug the modem completely—not just turn it off, but physically unplug it from the power outlet. Leave it unplugged for a full minute this time.

Customer: Okay. (pause) It's unplugged. (pause) Waiting... (pause) Alright, it's been a minute. Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Good. Go ahead and let me know what happens with the lights.

Customer: (pause) Lights are coming back on. White, green... (pause) ...and orange again. We're back to the orange light.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Michael, I'm going to be honest with you—this is looking like it might be something on our end with the line coming to your house. The modem should have fully synced by now. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check with our network team to see if there's an outage in your area or any issues with your specific line. Will you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music) (approximately 90 seconds)

Agent: Thanks for holding, Michael. I've checked with our network team, and they're not showing any outages in your area, which is... well, it's both good and not so good news. What I'm seeing is that your modem is trying to connect, but we're not getting a strong handshake on this end. 

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: It means the modem and our equipment aren't properly communicating. This could be a few things—it could be an issue with the line, it could be a problem with the equipment, or potentially something with the connection outside your home. Given that we saw maintenance trucks in the area yesterday, I'm wondering if that might have affected the line somehow.

Customer: So what do we do? Can you fix it?

Agent: (pause) So here's what I'd recommend. We can dispatch a technician to your home to physically check the line and the equipment. They can usually come out within 24 to 48 hours. However, I can also send a replacement modem to you if you'd like, in case this one is faulty. But my gut is telling me this is a line issue.

Customer: How long would that take? I need internet for work, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. If you'd like, I can try to get a technician out to you tomorrow. We have expedited scheduling available. It would likely be between 8 a.m. and noon, or noon to 5 p.m. window. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow? Yeah, I can do that. Noon to 5 should work.

Agent: Excellent. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I have you down for a technician visit tomorrow between noon and 5 p.m. You should get a confirmation text and email with those details. The technician will be able to diagnose exactly what's happening and get you back online. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. So tomorrow, yeah?

Agent: Yes, sir. Tomorrow between noon and 5 p.m. I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone, but I'm confident our technician will be able to get to the bottom of this.

Customer: Alright, well, I appreciate it. Thanks for trying.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll get you fixed up. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
