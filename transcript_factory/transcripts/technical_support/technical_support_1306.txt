Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. And just to confirm, you're in the Westfield area?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have you had any recent storms or weather in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine last night. I woke up, tried to use it, and nothing. No lights on the modem or anything.

Agent: Okay. Well, the first thing we should do is do a quick power cycle. Have you tried unplugging your modem yet?

Customer: No, I haven't done that yet. Where is that?

Agent: It's the box that's probably sitting near your router or TV. It might be white or black, and it has cables plugged into the back of it.

Customer: Oh, okay. Yeah, I see it. I see it right here.

Agent: Great. Can you go ahead and unplug it from the power outlet for me?

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Awesome. Just leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds, okay? That'll give it time to fully reset.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...alright, it's been about thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (background noise) Done. Now I'm waiting for it to boot back up.

Agent: Good. It should take about a minute or two for all the lights to come back on. While we wait, let me just check if there are any service outages in your area. (typing sounds) ...and it looks like we don't have any reported outages affecting your location, so that's good news.

Customer: Okay... (pause) The lights are back on now. Let me try... nope. Still nothing. I'm not getting internet.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Do you see a light that says "online" or "internet" on the modem? What I'm looking for is whether it's lit up or if it's red or off.

Customer: Um... the lights that are on are like... a power light, I think? And then there's like a white light that's blinking. But there's one that's definitely red.

Agent: Okay, so the red light is what we're concerned about. That typically indicates a connection issue. Let me try a couple other things. Can you check if all the cables going into the modem are securely connected? There should be a cable coming from the wall—that's usually the main one.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, let me check. (pause) The one coming from the wall looks pretty tight, but... wait, actually, let me... (sound of movement) ...okay, I just pushed it in a little more to make sure. But I'm not sure that was loose or not.

Agent: That's fine. Sometimes they just need that extra push. Go ahead and give it another minute to reconnect.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... no change. Still red.

Agent: Alright. And just to cover all the bases—is your computer or device connecting to the network at all? Like, do you see the WiFi network available?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...let me check my phone. No, I don't even see... I don't see the WiFi network showing up.

Agent: Okay, that tells me it's likely an issue with the modem itself not connecting to our network. Let me try rebooting it one more time, but this time through our system. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm initiating a remote reboot. This should take about... two to three minutes.

Customer: Alright, I'll just wait here.

Agent: (pause) ...and I'm just going to keep an eye on this from my end. How long have you been a customer with us?

Customer: Oh, probably about three years now?

Agent: Great, well I appreciate your business. (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing the modem reconnect on my end. That's... that's not ideal. Can you tell me—have you noticed any power fluctuations lately? Like, does the modem ever lose power or restart on its own?

Customer: Not that I've noticed, no. It's been pretty stable.

Agent: Okay. And when you look at the modem, is there a small reset button on the back or the bottom? It's usually recessed.

Customer: Um... (background noise) ...I think I see one, yeah. It's like a tiny hole?

Agent: That's the one. Now, I want to warn you that if we press this, it will completely reset the modem to factory settings, so we'll need to set it back up. But at this point, it might be worth trying. Are you comfortable with that?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I don't really know how to set it up, but... I guess we can try?

Agent: Okay. You can use a paperclip or something thin, and press and hold that button for about ten seconds.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm... I'm pressing it. (pause) How long do I hold it?

Agent: About ten seconds should do it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I let go. Now what?

Agent: Now let's just give it a few minutes to completely reboot and restart from scratch. When it comes back on, you should see a setup screen or something like that.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, so... the lights came back on again, but I'm still seeing that red light.

Agent: (sigh) Okay, yeah. Unfortunately, that red light persisting even after a reset is pretty indicative of a hardware issue with the modem itself, or possibly a line issue that we'd need to investigate from our side. 

Customer: So... what does that mean?

Agent: It means we have a couple of options. One would be to schedule a technician to come out and check the line coming into your home, and potentially replace the modem. Or, if you have another modem at home, we could try swapping it in to see if that's the issue.

Customer: I don't have another modem. So... how soon can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. What does your schedule look like? Are you available during business hours, or would you prefer an evening or weekend appointment?

Customer: Um, I work from home, so... I'm pretty flexible. When's the soonest someone could come?

Agent: (pause) It looks like we have availability... tomorrow afternoon between one and five PM, or we have Friday morning if that's better for you.

Customer: Tomorrow would be better. Afternoon tomorrow works.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm booking a technician visit for tomorrow, December 14th, between one and five in the afternoon. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue—could be the modem, could be the line, but we'll get to the bottom of it. You should receive a confirmation email shortly, and you'll get a text message about an hour before the technician arrives.

Customer: Okay, great. So I just... I don't have internet until then?

Agent: I'm afraid so. I apologize for the inconvenience. But the technician should be able to get you up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I think that's... I think that's everything. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for your patience today, and sorry again for the trouble. We'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Yep, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
