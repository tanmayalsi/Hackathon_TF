Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account and we'll figure this out together. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the address on Oak Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router that look unusual? Like are they on, off, blinking?

Customer: Um, okay so the modem is... the lights are all off actually. It's just completely dark.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The modem being completely dark usually means it's not getting power. Have you checked to make sure the power cable is securely plugged in on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Let me... let me go look at it. (background noise, footsteps) Okay, yeah, I'm looking at it now and... the cable's definitely plugged in. Both ends look fine to me.

Agent: Alright. And is the outlet itself working? Like, do you have anything else plugged into that outlet you could test?

Customer: Yeah, actually my lamp is plugged in right next to it and that's on, so the outlet's definitely working.

Agent: Good, that rules that out. Let me have you try unplugging the modem completely, and then wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. That'll do a full reset. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Sure. (pause, unplugging sounds) Alright, I'm unplugging it now. (pause) ...Okay, counting down here. (pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about two minutes for it to fully boot back up. While we're waiting, can you tell me... have there been any recent storms in your area, or any other issues?

Customer: Um, not really. Actually, wait—we did have some heavy wind last night. Pretty bad actually. But I wouldn't think that would knock out the internet.

Agent: That could definitely be a factor. Sometimes high winds can affect the lines. But we'll see. (pause) So just to give you an idea of what we're looking for, once the modem boots back up, we should see some green lights on it. The power light should come on, and then the internet light should come on in just a moment.

Customer: Okay, I'm watching it now... (pause) ...Nope. Still nothing. It's still completely dark.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's unusual. Let me ask you—is there a battery backup unit or anything like that between your outlet and your modem? Sometimes those can cause issues.

Customer: No, it's just plugged directly in.

Agent: Alright. And you're sure the cable is firmly in there? Sometimes these can look plugged in but not be completely seated.

Customer: (pause) Well, let me... let me try wiggling it around a bit and making sure it's really in there. (pause) Okay, I'm pushing it in pretty hard now and... (pause) ...no, still nothing.

Agent: Okay, I think we might be dealing with a hardware issue here, or possibly something on the line side. Let me try one more thing. Can you check the back of the modem and see if there's a small reset button? It usually looks like a little pinhole.

Customer: A reset button? Um... (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's the little button on the back.

Agent: That's the one. If you could take something small like a paperclip or a pen and press that for about 10 seconds, that'll do a hard reset.

Customer: (pause, clicking sounds) Okay, I'm doing that now. (pause) I'm holding it... (pause) Alright, letting go. (pause) And... (sigh) ...still nothing. No lights.

Agent: Okay, so the modem still isn't powering on at all. (typing sounds) Let me check something on my end here. (pause) I'm looking at your service status and... actually, let me see. (pause) Do you know if your internet has been working recently? Like yesterday or earlier this week?

Customer: Yeah, it was working fine yesterday. I was browsing around before I went to bed, no problems.

Agent: Right. And you haven't made any changes to anything? No new equipment or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing new. It's all the same stuff.

Agent: Okay. Well, based on what we've tried here, it seems like there might be an issue with the modem itself or potentially an issue with the line coming into your home. The fact that it's not powering on at all is... it's unusual. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, I can definitely help you with that. We have a couple of options. One would be to get a replacement modem sent out to you, but given that it might also be a line issue, I think the best thing would be to schedule a technician visit. They can check the modem and also verify that the line coming into your home is working properly.

Customer: (pause) How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... Looks like we have some openings tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have another slot on Thursday afternoon, between 1 and 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Um, tomorrow morning would be better. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get that scheduled for you. So that'll be tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. The technician will call you 15 minutes before they arrive. Is the phone number on your account still 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's the best number to reach me.

Agent: Perfect. And I'm just going to confirm the address is 448 Oak Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So I have your appointment scheduled for tomorrow morning, and the technician should be able to diagnose and fix the issue. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying to fix it, I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone, but I'm confident the technician will be able to get you up and running. If you have any questions before tomorrow, feel free to give us a call back. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Take care. Goodbye.
