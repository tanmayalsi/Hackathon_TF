# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I need to get this fixed pretty quickly.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help troubleshoot this with you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. I'm looking at your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. And it says here that service was active as of this morning. Can you tell me what exactly you're experiencing? Like, is the modem powered on? Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Um, yeah, the modem's on. I can see the power light is on, but... I don't know, the internet light or whatever... it's not lit up. It's just dark. And my phone won't connect to Wi-Fi.

Agent: Okay, that's actually helpful information. So the power light is on but the internet connection light is off. That typically indicates the modem isn't getting a signal from our network. Have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yes, please. Go ahead and unplug it, and then wait about 30 seconds before plugging it back in. I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great, just count to 30 in your head, or you know, whatever you're comfortable with.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in... (pause) Okay, it's powered back up. The lights are... yeah, the power light's back on again but the internet light is still not... it's still not coming on.

Agent: Okay. Let's give it maybe another 30 seconds or so to fully boot up. Sometimes it takes a minute.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. It's been like, a minute now.

Agent: I see. Alright, let me ask you a few more questions. Do you have a router separate from the modem, or is it a modem-router combo?

Customer: I have both, actually. So there's the modem you guys gave me, and then I have a separate router hooked up to it.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. And is the router powered on? Are you seeing lights on that as well?

Customer: Yeah, the router's on. I can see its lights... they look normal, I think. The power's on, the Wi-Fi light is on.

Agent: Good, good. So the router seems to be functioning. The issue is really coming from our modem. Can you check the cable that goes from the wall into your modem? Make sure it's... it's firmly seated in there. Sometimes it can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, hold on. (sounds of movement) Let me check that... (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it. It looks pretty tight to me, but... (pause) ...let me actually unplug it and plug it back in just to be sure.

Agent: Good idea.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's back in. Still nothing. The light's still not coming on.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm going to pull up your modem signals. Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your modem here and it's showing as offline in our system. That usually means... it could be a few things. Either the modem isn't receiving a signal from our network, or there might be an issue with the equipment itself. Have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, this is the first time. Everything was working fine yesterday. I was using it last night, no problems at all.

Agent: Okay, and you haven't done anything different with the setup or...?

Customer: No, nothing. I literally just turned on my computer this morning and the Wi-Fi wasn't connecting.

Agent: Right. Let me check our outage map to see if there's anything going on in your area. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages in your zip code, so it does appear to be isolated to your equipment. Let me try something else. Can you locate the reset button on the modem? It's usually a small button on the back.

Customer: Okay, let me... (pause) yeah, I see it. It's a small recessed button, right?

Agent: Yes, exactly. I'm going to have you do what we call a factory reset. Now, this will erase any custom settings you might have configured, but your modem should reset back to its default state. Are you comfortable with that?

Customer: Um, I guess so. Will I have to call back and set anything up?

Agent: Well, after we do the reset, the modem should automatically try to reconnect to our network. If it does, you shouldn't need to do anything on your end. But if it doesn't work, then we might need to look into some other options.

Customer: Okay, sure. What do I do?

Agent: I'll have you press and hold that reset button for about 10 seconds. Use a pen or a paperclip if you need to. And then release it.

Customer: (pause) Alright, pressing it now... (pause) ...holding it... (pause) and releasing. Okay, it's reset.

Agent: Good. The modem should now be restarting. Let's give it a minute or so to fully boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Um, the light's still not on. Nothing's changed.

Agent: (pause) I see. Okay, let me take a look at something else here. (typing sounds) (long pause) Alright, so the modem is still showing offline in our system. And the reset didn't help. That usually indicates to me that it could be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or there could be a line issue on our end.

Customer: So, what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, so here's what I'd like to do. Let me escalate this to our field service team. They have the ability to check the line from the pole to your house and also determine whether the modem needs to be replaced. But I do want to try one more thing first before we do that.

Customer: Okay, what's that?

Agent: Can you go ahead and check your bill or any documentation you have from Frontier? I want to see if there's maybe a different modem model number or... I just want to make sure we have the right equipment in your account.

Customer: (pause) (sounds of papers rustling) Um, I'm looking at my bill here... it says Model F4000. Is that what you're seeing?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check. (pause) Yes, I am seeing the F4000 in your account. That matches. Okay, that's good. We're on the same page there. And you've had that modem for how long now?

Customer: Probably about... two years? Maybe a little longer?

Agent: Okay, that's within the normal range. Um... (pause) I'm going to be honest with you. I'm not seeing anything else we can troubleshoot on my end. The modem isn't responding to our network, the reset didn't help, and the line seems to be functioning on our side. My best recommendation is to get a technician out to your house to investigate further.

Customer: (frustrated) So you're saying you can't fix this over the phone?

Agent: I wish I could, but at this point, a technician really needs to physically check the equipment and the line. They might discover it's something simple, or it could be the modem needs replacing. But they'll be able to assess it in person. Would you be available for a service visit?

Customer: I mean... yeah, I guess I have to be. When's the earliest someone can come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (pause) (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so the earliest I'm seeing is... we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have another slot on Friday afternoon between 1 PM and 5 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works better for me.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get some information from you to confirm the appointment. Is the phone number on file still 555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: And your address is still 847 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. Alright, so I've scheduled a technician visit for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. The technician will be able to troubleshoot the issue and replace the modem if needed. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (sigh) No, I guess that's it. I just... I'm frustrated that we couldn't fix this today, you know?

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Hopefully the technician will get you back up and running tomorrow. Is there a best number to reach you on if the technician needs to contact you before the appointment?

Customer: No, 555-0147 is fine.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this today. We appreciate your patience, and we'll get you taken care of tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.
