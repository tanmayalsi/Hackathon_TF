# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I need to get this fixed ASAP.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the number on my bill.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up here. And just to confirm, is this a residential account?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, residential. I've got the fiber service, been with you guys for about two years now.

Agent: Great, thank you. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Did anything happen before it went out? Like a storm, or did you restart your equipment recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I was just browsing this morning, everything was fine, and then I went to make some coffee and came back and nothing was loading. I've got that little modem box and the router sitting on my desk here.

Agent: Okay, that makes sense. Let's try a few basic things first. Can you look at your modem for me? I'm looking for a device that's about yay big... (gestures) ...with some lights on it?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. There's like, four or five little lights on the front?

Agent: Perfect. And what color are they? Are they green, red, or blinking?

Customer: Uh... (pause) ...they're mostly red right now. There's like one that's orange maybe? Yeah, orange and the rest are red.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Red lights usually indicate an issue with the connection. Let's try a power cycle first. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Sure, give me a second. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds for me while that powers down completely.

Customer: (pause) Alright... thirty seconds, right? How much longer?

Agent: Just about ten more seconds. Go ahead and count it down.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, I think that's good.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugging back in. (pause) It's booting up now, I can see the lights coming back on... and... (pause) ...they're going back to red again. That doesn't seem right.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, hmm. That's not what we want to see. Let me try something else. While we're waiting for it to fully boot up, can you check the ethernet cable? It's the one that connects to the modem—it looks like a phone cable but a little bigger.

Customer: Oh, the cable? Um, yeah, I see it. It's plugged in. It looks fine to me.

Agent: Okay, and then from there it should go to your router, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. Everything looks connected fine on my end.

Agent: Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing a strong signal coming from your modem right now. Let me check if there are any outages in your area. Can you give me your address?

Customer: 1247 Maple Street, apartment 3B. It's here in town.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not showing any major outages reported in your area. Let's try accessing your modem's settings. You can do this through another device if you have one, like a phone or a tablet. Can you grab your phone?

Customer: Hold on, yeah, I've got it here. What do I need to do?

Agent: Okay, so open up a web browser on your phone—Safari or Chrome, whichever you have.

Customer: Okay, I'm opening Chrome. (pause) What do I type in?

Agent: Type in 192.168.100.1 and hit enter.

Customer: (pause) Um... (pause) ...it's not loading. It's saying "can't reach this page" or something.

Agent: Okay, that's... that's actually not good. Normally you should be able to access that. This usually means the modem isn't communicating properly. (pause) Let me put you on a brief hold while I check some things in our system and see if we need to escalate this. It'll just be a couple minutes.

Customer: Sure, okay.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) (pause) (Agent returns) Thanks for holding. I've looked into your account and I'm seeing some unusual activity on your line. It's possible there's an issue with the connection between your modem and our network. Normally I'd say this could be something with the equipment itself, but let me have you try one more thing. Do you still have the password that came with your modem? It should be on a sticker on the back.

Customer: Yeah, I think I do. Let me flip it over. (pause) Okay, I see something that says "admin" and then a password.

Agent: Perfect. Can you try to—actually, wait, I'm sorry—since the web interface isn't loading, that won't help us. Let me try a different approach. Can you look at your modem one more time and tell me if there's a small reset button on it? It's usually recessed into the device.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's a little button here that's like, pushed in.

Agent: Okay, but I need you to be careful with this. Before you press it, I need to warn you—a reset will erase all of your settings. So we might need to reconfigure things afterward. Are you comfortable with that?

Customer: I mean, if it'll get my internet working, sure. I'll do it.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and use a paperclip or something small to hold it in for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... and... (pause) ...the lights are going crazy now, everything's flashing. I'm letting go. (pause) Now it's rebooting again.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let's wait for it to fully boot up. This might take a minute or two.

Customer: (pause) ...It's still rebooting. (longer pause) Okay, now the lights are... still mostly red. One green light now but... yeah, still pretty red.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm not going to sugarcoat this—what we're seeing here suggests there might be a deeper issue. It could be something with the line itself coming into your apartment, or it could be a hardware failure with the modem. (pause) At this point, I think we need to get a technician out there to take a look. Have you had any issues like this before?

Customer: No, never. It's been pretty solid until today. So what, you're saying you can't fix it over the phone?

Agent: Unfortunately not. The troubleshooting steps we've done—the power cycle, the reset—those typically resolve connection issues, but they're not working in this case. I think we need an in-person visit to diagnose what's going on. Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) What's your availability looking like this week?

Customer: I mean, I work from home, so I need this fixed pretty quickly. Can someone come out today?

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) I'm looking at today and we're pretty booked, but let me see... we do have a slot tomorrow morning between eight and noon. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sighs) Tomorrow morning? I guess it has to. Can't they come out today at all?

Agent: I wish I could get someone there today, but it looks like tomorrow's the earliest we can schedule. And just so you know, there is a service call fee of $79.99 unless this is a network issue on our end, in which case that would be waived.

Customer: Great, of course there's a fee. (pause) Okay, yeah, schedule me for tomorrow morning then.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. So I have you down for tomorrow, March 14th, between 8 AM and noon. A technician will arrive and they'll be able to troubleshoot in person. Is the phone number 555-0147 the best way to reach you?

Customer: Uh, yeah, that works.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation email shortly. I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I'll see your tech tomorrow.

Agent: Thank you for your patience, and sorry again for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Yeah, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
