# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because my internet went down this morning and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here... Got it. So your service went down this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 AM. One minute it was working fine, the next it just... stopped. I really need this working—I've got work from home stuff I need to do.

Agent: I understand. Let me just check our system here to see if there are any known outages in your area. (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any active outages reported, but that doesn't mean there isn't something going on locally. Let me walk you through some basic troubleshooting, alright?

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent: Perfect. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the modem powered on?

Customer: Um, let me look... Yeah, the modem has lights on it. There's like a green light and a red light blinking.

Agent: Okay, so the red light is blinking—that's actually not what we want to see. That typically indicates a connection issue. Do you have a router as well, or are you just using the modem?

Customer: I have both. The router has... let me see... it's got a blue light that's steady, and then like a green one that's blinking too.

Agent: Alright. So the router seems to be powered on. Can you do me a favor? I'm going to need you to unplug the modem for me. Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay, pulling it now. (pause) Done.

Agent: Good. Let that sit for about 30 seconds. We're just going to do a full reset here.

Customer: (pause) Uh huh...

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. (background noise) Give it a second to boot up...

Agent: Yeah, this can take a minute or two. Just watch those lights for me. We're looking for them to go through a boot sequence. You might see them flash or change colors.

Customer: Yeah, I'm watching it. There's like... a lot of blinking happening right now. Is that normal?

Agent: That's actually normal, yeah. That's the modem going through its startup process. This should take anywhere from 30 seconds to maybe two minutes.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so now I'm seeing... the green light is solid green, which is good, right? But the red one is still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Hmm, okay. The red light continuing to blink is unusual. That's typically indicating a connection problem on our end. Can you tell me—do you see any loose cables connected to the modem? Anything that looks disconnected?

Customer: Let me check... No, everything looks plugged in pretty tight. There's the cable from the wall, then the one going to my router.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else. I'm going to send a refresh signal to your modem from here. This might take just a moment. (typing sounds) Okay, signal sent. Can you watch the modem and tell me if anything changes?

Customer: (pause) No, it's... it's the same. Still got that red light blinking.

Agent: Okay, I'm not getting a strong signal back from your modem, which is concerning. Let me pull up your account history here... (pause) I'm seeing that you've had pretty reliable service up until now. No recent issues.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is something broken?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be an issue with the modem itself, or it could be an issue with the line coming into your house. There's also a possibility that there's something happening at our local node that I'm not seeing in the system yet. Let me try one more thing. Can you unplug the router for me?

Customer: The router? Sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now wait about 30 seconds and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugged it back in... and it's booting up... We're waiting... okay, the lights are coming back on...

Agent: Good. Give that another moment or two.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's all booted. Same situation though. Modem's still got that red light blinking.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm going to be honest with you—based on what I'm seeing and what you're describing, this is beyond what I can troubleshoot over the phone. The modem isn't establishing a proper connection, and I'm not picking up a strong signal from your equipment. This typically indicates either a modem failure or a line issue on our end.

Customer: So what do I do? I really need my internet working.

Agent: I completely understand. We have a couple of options here. We can schedule a technician to come out and physically check your line and your equipment. They'd be able to determine whether it's the modem or something external causing the problem. Or, if you want, we can overnight you a replacement modem and you could try swapping that out first.

Customer: How long would a technician take? I mean, when could they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... The soonest I'm seeing is tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: I guess that'll have to work. It's not ideal, but...

Agent: I know this is frustrating. Let me get that scheduled for you. Can I confirm your service address?

Customer: It's 412 Maple Street, Apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) 412 Maple Street, Apartment 3B. Perfect. So I have you down for tomorrow, between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. If it's the modem, they can replace it on the spot. If it's something with the line, they'll take care of that as well.

Customer: Okay. And you're sure there's nothing else I can try between now and then?

Agent: (pause) Well, you could try the modem swap option if you want something sooner. I could get one expedited to you, but honestly, it's not guaranteed to arrive before tomorrow anyway, and given what I'm seeing, I have a suspicion it might be something on our end. I think a technician visit is your best bet.

Customer: Alright, fine. Tomorrow it is.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation email shortly. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Thanks for trying, anyway.

Agent: I appreciate your patience, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. We'll get you back online tomorrow. If you need anything before then, feel free to give us a call back. Have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
