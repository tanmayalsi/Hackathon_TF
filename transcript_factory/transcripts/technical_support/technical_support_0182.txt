Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got some work stuff I need to do today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me just pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. And just to confirm, this is for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have you tried unplugging your modem and router yet?

Customer: Um, no, I haven't actually. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, let's start with that. Go ahead and unplug both devices for about 30 seconds, and then plug them back in. That'll restart them.

Customer: (background noise, rustling) Okay, yeah, I'm doing that now. (pause) Alright, they're unplugged. I'm gonna count to 30... (longer pause) Okay, plugging them back in now.

Agent: Great. Now let's give them a minute or so to boot back up. While we're waiting, did you notice any lights on the modem before you unplugged it?

Customer: Um, let me think... I think there was a red light? Or maybe orange? I'm not super tech-savvy, so...

Agent: That's okay. A red or orange light usually indicates there's an issue with the connection. (pause) Okay, do you see the lights coming back on now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm seeing lights again. There's a green one now... but there's also still a red light on one of them.

Agent: Okay, which device is showing the red light? The modem or the router?

Customer: It's the, um... (pause) ...the smaller box? I'm not entirely sure which is which.

Agent: No problem. The modem is usually the larger rectangular device, and the router is typically smaller. The red light on the router is actually pretty normal sometimes. Let me ask you this—are you able to see your WiFi network when you look at available networks on your phone or computer?

Customer: (pause) Let me check... (typing sounds in background) Um, no. I don't see it. I don't see anything.

Agent: Alright. Can you try moving closer to the modem and router? Sometimes there's interference from walls or other devices.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm right next to them now. (pause) Nope, still nothing. No WiFi networks showing up at all.

Agent: Hmm. Let me try a different approach. Can you do me a favor and check the back of your modem? I need you to look for a small button, usually labeled "reset." Don't press it yet—just let me know if you see it.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's a little recessed button.

Agent: Perfect. Now, I want you to press and hold that button for about ten seconds. This will perform a full reset of the modem.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...holding it... (longer pause) ...alright, I released it.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about two minutes for it to fully reboot. This might take a bit longer than before.

Customer: (pause) Okay. How long do you think this'll take?

Agent: Usually about a minute or two. Just give it a little time. In the meantime, can you tell me—have there been any recent storms in your area? Or any work done on the lines outside your house?

Customer: Um, no storms that I know of. There might have been some construction down the street yesterday, but I'm not sure if that's related.

Agent: It could be, but probably not if it just went down this morning. (pause) Alright, can you check on the modem now? Are the lights looking any different?

Customer: (pause) Um... there's still a red light. Actually, I think maybe more red lights now than before?

Agent: Okay, that's not what we want to see. Usually that indicates a connection issue on our end. Let me try something else here. Can you unplug the cable that's going into the back of the modem? The coaxial cable—it's the one that looks kind of like a TV cable.

Customer: (pause) Sure, um... (rustling sounds) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Now check to see if there's any corrosion or damage on the connector. Does it look clean?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks okay to me. It's not bent or anything.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in, and make sure it's tight.

Customer: (pause) Done. It's pretty snug.

Agent: Good. Now, unfortunately what we're seeing here—the persistent red lights and no WiFi network showing up—that typically indicates either a service outage in your area or a problem with the modem itself. Let me check our system to see if there are any outages reported on your line.

(typing sounds, pause)

Agent: Okay, I'm not seeing any active outages on our end for your address. So it could be that the modem is having an issue. Have you had any power surges or anything unusual happen recently?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of. Just... it was working fine yesterday, and then this morning it was just dead.

Agent: I understand. Um, let me try one more thing before we explore other options. Can you try doing a full power cycle? Unplug the modem, unplug the router, and then wait about a full minute before plugging them back in—modem first, then router.

Customer: (sighs) Okay... (pause, rustling sounds) Unplugging now. (longer pause) Alright, waiting. (pause) How much longer?

Agent: Just a little bit more. The capacitors need to fully drain.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging the modem back in... (pause) ...and the router... (pause) Alright, they're both on.

Agent: Good. Let's give it another two minutes this time.

(longer pause)

Customer: [inaudible] ...still nothing. Still red lights.

Agent: Still showing red?

Customer: Yeah. I don't know what's going on.

Agent: Okay, I know this is frustrating. At this point, I've exhausted most of the standard troubleshooting steps. What I'm suspecting is that either there's an issue with the modem hardware itself, or there could be a line issue that's not showing up in our system yet. I have a couple of options for you. We can schedule a technician to come out to your home and do a full diagnostic. They'd be able to check the equipment and the line. Or, we could try sending a replacement modem to you first and see if that resolves the issue.

Customer: How long would a technician take to come out?

Agent: Let me check availability... (typing sounds) (pause) It looks like we have availability tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we could get someone out on Thursday morning.

Customer: Tomorrow works better for me. Can we do that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. And in the meantime, if you happen to see any changes with the modem—like if the lights go green or if your WiFi network appears—just give us a call back and let us know. Sometimes things resolve on their own.

Customer: Okay. Should I try anything else, or just leave everything as is?

Agent: Just leave everything plugged in and as is. The technician will want to see it in the state it's currently in. They'll have specialized equipment to diagnose the problem.

Customer: Got it. What time tomorrow should I expect someone?

Agent: They'll arrive sometime between 1 and 5 PM. They may call or text you about 30 minutes before they arrive to narrow down the window. Is that phone number on the account still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yes, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just confirm everything here. (typing sounds) Your service call is scheduled for tomorrow, [inaudible], between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will come out to diagnose the issue with your modem and line connection. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can get it working tomorrow.

Agent: We'll do our best. I'm sorry you're experiencing this issue. We really appreciate your patience, and the technician will take great care of you. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: Alright, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye!
