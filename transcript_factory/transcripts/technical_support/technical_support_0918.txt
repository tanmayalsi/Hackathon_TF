# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out completely. It's been down for like... I don't know, twenty minutes or so? And I need it back up because I'm working from home.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147. And my last name is Chen.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, Mr. Chen. I've got your account pulled up here. I'm showing we have your service address as 447 Maple Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage—is that right? Nothing's working at all?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. My modem's on, the lights are... I mean, they're blinking, but nothing's actually connecting. My laptop says no internet connection.

Agent: Okay, those are good details. The modem lights blinking is actually a good sign—it means it's powered on and trying to sync. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Have there been any recent storms or weather in your area?

Customer: No, not that I'm aware of. It's been clear all day.

Agent: Alright, good. And have you made any changes to your setup recently? New equipment, or...?

Customer: No, everything's been the same for months. It was working fine this morning, and now it's just... dead.

Agent: Understood. Let's do some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me which modem you're using? It should say the model number on the front or back.

Customer: (pause) Uh, let me look here... It says "Arris SB8200."

Agent: Perfect, that's a solid modem. Okay, so here's what I want you to do. Can you unplug the modem from the power for about thirty seconds? Just pull it out completely.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we wait, let me just ask—is your internet bill current? Any issues with your account that you're aware of?

Customer: No, no, I pay it on time every month. Everything should be fine on that end.

Agent: Excellent. That's not the issue then. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) The lights are turning back on... they're blinking green and amber right now.

Agent: Good, that's what we want to see. The amber light usually means it's syncing with the network. Let's give it about a minute to fully boot back up.

Customer: (pause) How long is this usually supposed to take?

Agent: Typically about sixty to ninety seconds. We're almost there. While we're waiting, let me check your line. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, so that's a positive sign.

Customer: Okay, so it's probably not a widespread thing then.

Agent: Right, looks like it's isolated to your setup. (pause) How are those lights looking now?

Customer: Um, still blinking. There's green and then like... a yellow or amber color. Still blinking though.

Agent: Okay, so it should be getting close. Let me have you try connecting a device. Do you have your laptop nearby?

Customer: Yeah, I'm right here with it. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at available networks and... hmm, the Frontier network isn't showing up. That's weird.

Agent: Hmm, that is odd. That usually shows up pretty quickly once the modem reboots. Let me ask—do you have any other devices you could try? Like a phone?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my phone right here. (pause) I'm checking the networks and... nope, nothing. The Frontier network isn't broadcasting.

Agent: Alright, that tells me the modem might not be fully syncing with our network. Let me check your account on my end again. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your modem status here, and it's showing as offline on our system.

Customer: Offline? So what does that mean?

Agent: It means the modem isn't communicating with our network properly. This can happen for a few reasons. Let me try a few things from my end. (pause) Okay, I'm going to send a reboot command to your modem right now. That's different from unplugging it—this comes from our system.

Customer: Oh, okay. How long will that take?

Agent: Give it about two minutes. You'll probably see the lights reset. Just let me know when they come back.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I see them turning off now. (longer pause) Okay, they're back on. And... (pause) still blinking the same way.

Agent: Still the same pattern, huh? (pause) Alright, let me try a different approach. I'm going to have you do a factory reset on the modem. Now, this will erase your current settings, but we can reconfigure it. You'll need to hold the reset button on the back of the modem for about fifteen seconds.

Customer: A factory reset? Are you sure that's... I mean, won't that mess things up?

Agent: I understand your concern. It's a standard troubleshooting step, and I'll be able to walk you through reconfiguring it. The reset button is usually recessed, so you might need a pen or paperclip to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see it. Let me grab a pen. (pause) Alright, I'm pressing it. (pause) Nothing's happening yet. (pause) How long do I need to hold it?

Agent: About fifteen seconds. You should see the lights go dark and then come back on like they're starting fresh.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see them flashing. I guess that's it?

Agent: Perfect. Let it sit for about two to three minutes. This time it's going to go through a full boot sequence, and we should see different behavior.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, it's been a couple minutes. The lights are... still kind of the same. There's that blinking green and yellow again.

Agent: Okay, and when you check your phone, the network's still not showing up?

Customer: (pause) Right, still nothing. The Frontier network is not there.

Agent: (sigh) Alright, let me check your line status again on my end. (typing sounds, pause) Mr. Chen, I'm showing that your line isn't coming up on our network. The modem's trying to sync, but it can't complete the handshake.

Customer: Okay, so what does that mean? Is there something wrong with the line?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be an issue with the connection coming into your home, or there could be a problem on our network side. Let me ask—do you have any splitters on your cable line coming into the house? Anything that might be dividing the signal?

Customer: A splitter? I don't think so. I mean, I don't really know. The modem's just plugged into the wall where the cable comes in.

Agent: Alright, that's the right setup. Have you noticed any loose cables or anything unusual physically with the modem or the connection point?

Customer: (pause) Not that I can see. Everything looks pretty normal to me.

Agent: Okay. At this point, I think we might need to escalate this. The modem itself seems to be functioning, but it's unable to establish a connection with our network. This could indicate an issue with your service line or potentially a problem on our network infrastructure.

Customer: So... what does that mean? How do I get this fixed?

Agent: Here's what I can do. I can schedule a technician to come out to your location and physically inspect the line and equipment. They'll be able to check everything from the outside connection point to your modem. Is that something you'd be interested in?

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back up.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) I can get someone out to you tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we have availability on Thursday morning between 9 AM and 12 PM. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be better. I need to get some work done Thursday.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule that for you tomorrow, April 10th, between 1 and 5 PM. Our technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive to confirm they're on the way. Is the number on file still good?

Customer: Yeah, 555-0147, that's my cell.

Agent: Excellent. I've got that noted. (typing sounds) Okay, I've scheduled technician service for tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime, or do you have any questions about the appointment?

Customer: No, I guess I'll just... not have internet until tomorrow then. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Chen, and I'm sorry we weren't able to resolve this remotely. Our technician is very experienced, and I'm confident they'll get you back up and running quickly. Just make sure someone's home tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM.

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: My pleasure. Thank you for being patient with us, and we appreciate your business with Frontier. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Goodbye, Mr. Chen.
