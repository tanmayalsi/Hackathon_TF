Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm really not sure what's going on. I need to get it fixed pretty soon because I have work I need to do from home.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account here under... is this James Patterson?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. When exactly did you first notice it wasn't working?

Customer: I'd say around 7 AM. I turned on my computer to check my emails and there was just... nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Alright. And just to clarify, are you seeing any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) yeah, actually. The power light is on, but I think... I think the internet light is red. Or maybe it's orange? It's definitely not the normal green color.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The red or orange light typically indicates a connection issue. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug your modem for me? Just pull the power cord out completely.

Customer: Okay, doing that now... (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While that's unplugging, can you also unplug your router?

Customer: My router? Um... where is that exactly? I've got a box with Frontier written on it...

Agent: That's probably it. There might be two separate devices, or sometimes they're combined into one unit. Do you see more than one box?

Customer: No, just the one. Okay, I'm unplugging it now. (pause) Done.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about 30 seconds for everything to fully power down. (pause) While we wait, have you had any issues with your service recently? Any storms or anything like that in your area?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear actually. This just happened out of nowhere. It was working fine yesterday.

Agent: Okay, let's go ahead and plug everything back in now. The modem first.

Customer: Alright. (pause) Plugging it back in... (pause) Okay, it's in.

Agent: And now the router, if you have a separate one.

Customer: (pause) Got it. They're both plugged in now.

Agent: Good. This usually takes about two to three minutes for everything to boot back up. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing now?

Customer: Um... the power light is blinking. It's like... blinking white or something.

Agent: That's normal during startup. Give it another minute or so and it should stabilize. While we're waiting, have you tried connecting to your internet yet? Like on your phone or computer?

Customer: No, not yet. Should I try now?

Agent: Let's wait just a bit longer. Usually you want to give it a full two to three minutes. (pause) How long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, I'd say... almost three years now? Yeah, about three years.

Agent: Great. And is this the first time you've experienced an outage?

Customer: Yeah, actually. Everything's been pretty reliable up until now, which is why this is so weird.

Agent: (typing sounds) I'm not showing any outages in your area, so that's a good sign. Okay, it should be about ready now. Can you try connecting on one of your devices?

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me grab my phone... (pause) Alright, I'm looking at the WiFi networks... I can see my Frontier network... (pause) Trying to connect now... (pause) It's asking for my password... (typing sounds) Okay, I'm entering it... (pause) It's... it's not connecting. It just says "unable to connect" or something like that.

Agent: Alright, let's try something else. Can you look at the lights on the modem again? What are you seeing now?

Customer: Okay, so the power light is on, solid white I think, and then the... the internet light is still orange or red. It's not green.

Agent: That red or orange light on the internet port is the issue. That typically means there's a connection problem between the modem and our network. Let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) 

(pause)

Have you noticed any damage to the cable that goes into your modem? Sometimes if there's a loose connection or damage to the line...

Customer: The cable? Um, let me see... (pause) No, it looks fine to me. It's plugged in pretty tight.

Agent: Okay. Can you try unplugging it and plugging it back in? Just that main cable that connects to the modem?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Okay, pulling it out... and... plugging it back in. (pause) There we go.

Agent: Does that light change at all?

Customer: (pause) No, it's still red or orange. Same as before.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Let me try rebooting your modem from my end here to see if that helps. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm initiating a remote restart. Give it about a minute.

Customer: (pause) Should I see something happen, or...?

Agent: You might see the lights flicker or go dark for a moment. Just keep an eye on it.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Yeah, I see the lights went off for a second... and now they're back on... and... (pause) [inaudible] the internet light is still orange.

Agent: Still orange, okay. (typing sounds, pause) This is strange. I'm not seeing any issues on the network side for your account. The modem should be getting a signal. 

(pause)

Can you tell me... is this a modem that Frontier provided to you, or did you purchase your own?

Customer: Oh, it's yours. The one you guys installed when I first got the service.

Agent: Okay, that helps. It's possible the modem itself is failing. That can happen after a few years. Let me ask you this—have you noticed the modem getting unusually hot at all?

Customer: (pause) Actually, now that you mention it... yeah, it does feel kind of warm to the touch. Is that bad?

Agent: That could definitely be a contributing factor. It's not ideal, but it shouldn't be completely stopping your service. (pause) Alright, let me try one more thing before we move forward. I'm going to send a different signal to your modem. Can you just stay on the line for a moment while I do that?

Customer: Yeah, of course.

Agent: (typing sounds, longer pause) Okay, I've sent that through. Can you check the lights one more time?

Customer: (pause) Okay... no, still the same. Still that orange light.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I'm going to be honest with you—at this point, I think we might be looking at a hardware issue with your modem. Usually when we see this particular problem and the light won't respond to resets or signal resets from our end, it's typically a modem failure.

Customer: So like... the modem is broken?

Agent: It appears that way, unfortunately. I know that's frustrating, especially when you need your internet for work. What I can do is schedule a technician to come out and either replace the modem or diagnose what's happening in person. 

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what our availability is... We have some openings tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we could schedule something for later in the week.

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... I really need my internet today if possible.

Agent: I understand. Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day appointments available. But tomorrow between 1 and 5 would be the soonest. Does that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess that'll have to work. Can I do it in the morning instead? The afternoon doesn't work great for me.

Agent: Let me check... (typing sounds, pause) Unfortunately morning slots are all booked tomorrow. The 1 to 5 window is what we have available.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, fine. Let's do that.

Agent: Great. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. Can I get a callback number?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as my account number.

Agent: Perfect. Just to confirm everything, we'll have a technician coming to your address tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM to address the modem issue. They'll likely replace it or perform diagnostics on-site. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... I really hope they can fix it tomorrow because I've got a lot of work to catch up on.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. The technician should be able to get you up and running. You'll receive a confirmation email and possibly a text with more details about the visit.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye now.
