# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back online. I've been without service for like three hours now and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I'm seeing your account for... is this the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage, is that correct? No connection at all?

Customer: Right, yeah. The modem's been blinking red since this morning. I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, but nothing's changed.

Agent: Okay, that's actually a good first step that you already tried. The red light typically indicates a connection issue. Let me walk you through a few more troubleshooting steps. Can you tell me... is the modem powered on right now?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. Like I said, it's just blinking red.

Agent: Got it. And do you see any other lights on the modem?

Customer: Um... (pause) let me look at it closer. There's a power light that's solid green, and then... yeah, there's another light that's blinking orange next to it.

Agent: Okay, so you have a solid green power light and an orange blinking light. That's helpful information. Can you check one more thing for me? Look at the back of the modem and tell me if the cable coming in from the wall is securely connected.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm checking... it looks pretty tight to me. Should I try wiggling it or something?

Agent: Let's try that. Just gently wiggle the cable connection at the modem end and let me know if you see any changes in the lights.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, I'm doing it... nope, still the same. Orange blinking, green solid. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Alright. Let me check our system here to see if there are any service outages in your area. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not showing any widespread outages on Maple Street currently. When did this start exactly?

Customer: This morning around 8 AM. I was working from home and just suddenly lost connection.

Agent: And it's been down the entire time since then?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. No internet at all.

Agent: Okay. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem from the power source, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in? Sometimes a full power cycle can reset the modem's connection to our network.

Customer: Sure, hold on. (sounds of unplugging) Okay, unplugged. I'm counting... thirty seconds... (pause) alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) The lights are... the green one came back on, and now the orange one is... actually, wait. Is that light supposed to be blinking that fast? It's blinking really fast now.

Agent: That's actually... that can sometimes happen during the boot-up process. Let me have you wait about two minutes for the modem to fully restart and then we'll see what happens with those lights.

Customer: Okay, I'll wait. (long pause) Still going. The orange light is still blinking super fast.

Agent: Alright, I'm waiting here with you. How about now?

Customer: (pause) ...No, still blinking. It's been like, what, maybe ninety seconds now?

Agent: Yeah, we'll give it another thirty seconds or so. (pause) These modems can take a couple minutes sometimes. How long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, about two years, I think? I haven't really had any issues until today.

Agent: That's good to hear. Most of the time these connectivity issues resolve pretty quickly. (pause) Okay, how are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Still the same. Orange still blinking fast, green is solid. No change.

Agent: Hmm. (typing sounds) Okay, this is unusual. Let me try something from my end. I'm going to send a signal to your modem to see if it reestablishes the connection. Give me just a moment here... (pause) Alright, did you see any lights flicker or change at all?

Customer: No, nothing. Still looks the same.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let me check something. Have you had any storms recently? Sometimes lightning can damage equipment or affect the lines.

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear all week. Nothing like that.

Agent: Alright. What I'm going to need to do is... (pause, typing sounds) ...is escalate this to our technical team, but before I do that, let me try one last thing. Can you restart your computer or your device you're trying to connect with?

Customer: Um... I mean, I tested it on my phone too, and the WiFi wasn't showing up at all. It's not a device issue.

Agent: Right, you're right. Okay, I think at this point we might be looking at a line issue or a problem with the modem itself. [inaudible] Let me see if I can get a technician out to your location today. One moment please, I'm going to check our availability.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: (long pause, holding music in background) Thank you for holding. I'm looking at our technician schedule and unfortunately we're pretty booked up today. The earliest I can get someone out to you would be... it looks like tomorrow morning between 8 and 11 AM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... I really needed to get this fixed today. I'm supposed to be working from home.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for that. We've had pretty high volume today. Let me see if there's anything I can do here... (pause, typing sounds) ...okay, I've noted your case as priority, but I'm not able to get anyone out sooner than tomorrow morning. Is the 8 to 11 AM window going to work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I guess it'll have to. This is really frustrating though.

Agent: I know, and I apologize. I wish I could have gotten this resolved today for you. Just so you know, there's no charge for the service call since this is likely a modem or line issue that we need to investigate. Let me get your contact number verified—is it still 555-0184?

Customer: No, it's 555-0188. My cell phone.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've updated that. So to confirm, a technician will arrive between 8 and 11 AM tomorrow morning. They'll run diagnostics on the line and the modem, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Okay. And if the modem just needs to be replaced, they can do that?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. If the modem is defective, they can swap it out for you on the spot. Is there anything else I can help clarify before I close out this ticket?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm just... I'm not happy about losing a whole day of work here.

Agent: I really do apologize for that. If you have any questions before the technician arrives tomorrow, you can call back and reference your ticket number, which is... (typing sounds) ...it's 847293. Again, I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this today.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, and thank you for your patience. Have a good rest of your day, and we'll get this taken care of tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
