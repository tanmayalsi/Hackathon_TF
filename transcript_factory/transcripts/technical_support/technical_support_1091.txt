Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, my name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it fixed. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. Your service address is on Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Alright. So your internet went down this morning? Did anything happen before it went down—like a storm, power outage, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I just went to check my email and nothing was loading. The WiFi symbol is just... it's not even showing up on my phone or anything.

Agent: Okay, so you're not seeing the WiFi network at all. That's helpful. Let me ask you this—do you have a modem and router, or is it a combined unit?

Customer: Um, I think it's just one box? It's white, sits on the shelf by my TV.

Agent: Perfect, so that's a combined unit. And, uh, can you tell me what lights are on it right now? Are there any lights blinking, solid, anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... Yeah, there's like a power light that's on, it's solid green. But I don't see any of the internet lights or the WiFi lights or anything. They're all dark.

Agent: Okay, so just the power light is on. That's good information. And you said the internet went down this morning—have you tried unplugging the device yet and plugging it back in?

Customer: No, I haven't actually. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, let's try that. Go ahead and unplug it from the power for about 30 seconds. That'll help reset the device.

Customer: (background noise, rustling) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Just let it sit for a moment... alright, go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, it's back in. (pause) Um, so now what?

Agent: Now let's wait about two minutes for it to boot back up. We should see more lights come on. Why don't you tell me a little bit about what's been going on with your service recently? Any issues before today?

Customer: No, actually it's been pretty solid. I've had Frontier for like... I don't know, three years? And this is the first time something like this has happened.

Agent: That's great to hear. Okay, so it's been working well for you. Has it been two minutes or so?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, pretty close. Let me look at it again... Okay, so now I've got the power light, still green, and I see like... an orange light blinking. Is that normal?

Agent: (pause) Okay, so an orange light blinking is actually... that usually indicates it's trying to connect to the network. That's a good sign. Let's give it another minute to fully boot up.

Customer: Alright.

Agent: (typing sounds) And just so you know, while we're waiting, I'm not seeing any outages in your area on our end, so that's good news.

Customer: Okay, that's... that's good, I guess.

Agent: Alright, has another minute passed? What are we seeing now on the modem?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) I still see the power light, and that orange light is still blinking. It hasn't changed.

Agent: Hmm, okay. The orange light should have turned solid blue by now if it had connected properly. Let me try a different approach. Can you try a factory reset? There should be a small hole on the back of the modem—you'll need a paperclip or something thin to press it for about ten seconds.

Customer: A factory reset? Isn't that gonna... won't that mess anything up?

Agent: I know it sounds a little intimidating, but no, it won't cause any problems. It'll just reset it back to the default settings, kind of like what we did with the power cycle but a bit more thorough. We'll be able to reprogram it if we need to.

Customer: Okay, (pause) let me find a paperclip... (background rustling) I found one. I'm looking for that hole on the back...

Agent: It's usually on the back panel, might be labeled "reset" next to it.

Customer: (pause) I think I found it. I'm gonna press it now.

Agent: Go ahead.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... (pause) Wow, that's pretty small. (pause) Alright, I've been holding it for like ten seconds. Now what?

Agent: Now let's wait for it to fully restart. That should take a couple of minutes. While it's doing that, can you check something for me? Can you see if there are any cables plugged into the back? Sometimes cables can get loosened accidentally.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking... There's a cable coming from the wall, and it's plugged in pretty tight. The other cables look fine too.

Agent: Alright, that's good. Okay, let's check the status now. What are we seeing?

Customer: (pause) Same thing. Still just the green power light and the orange blinking light.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's... hmm. Let me see if I can run a diagnostic from my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I'm not getting a signal from your modem at all. It's like it's not communicating with our network. That usually means either there's an issue with the connection coming into your home, or there could be a problem with the modem itself.

Customer: So like... what does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. Let me try one more thing before we go down that road. Can you check the cable coming from the wall? See if there's a coaxial cable—it's got a little screw connector on the end?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's the one that looks like a little antenna connector, right?

Agent: Exactly. Can you unscrew it and screw it back in to make sure it's good and tight?

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm unscrewing it... it came out pretty easy actually. (pause) Okay, screwing it back in. (pause) That's tighter. Did that help?

Agent: Let's wait just a moment and see if the modem responds. Check those lights again?

Customer: (long pause) Still orange and blinking. Nothing changed.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm going to be honest with you—at this point, I think we're looking at either a line issue on our side or a modem issue. I'd really like to get a technician out to your home to do a proper diagnostic. Is that something that would work for you?

Customer: How long would that take? Like, how soon could someone come out?

Agent: Let me check availability... (typing sounds) (pause) I can get someone out there tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need my internet today if possible...

Agent: I understand, and I'm really sorry. Unfortunately, same-day service isn't available in your area right now. Tomorrow is the earliest opening we have.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, I guess that'll have to work. Do I need to be home?

Agent: Yes, someone will need to be there to let the technician in. Is the address on Maple Street still correct for the appointment?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. You should get a confirmation email within the next few minutes, and you can also call us back if you need to reschedule. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I really hope so too. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone today. Our technician will be much better equipped to figure out what's going on. Thank you for being patient with me, and thank you for choosing Frontier.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: Have a good day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
