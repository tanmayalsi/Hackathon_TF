Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I've got work calls scheduled and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I completely understand. That's frustrating. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing your account for... is this 2847 Maple Drive?

Customer: That's correct, yes.

Agent: Great. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Can you tell me a little bit about what you're experiencing right now? Are you getting any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Um, well, let me check. I'm looking at it now. The modem has... there's a red light on it. It's just solid red, and nothing else is really lighting up on the router.

Agent: Okay, so the modem is showing red. That typically indicates either a connection issue or possibly a power issue. Let's start with the basics here. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Sure, doing that now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. While that's unplugged, can you also unplug your router? That's usually the separate box, might be white or black...

Customer: Yeah, I see it. (pause) Okay, they're both unplugged now.

Agent: Excellent. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds. Just give the system a moment to fully power down.

Customer: (pause) How much longer?

Agent: Just a few more seconds... and go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm plugging it back in. (pause) Hmm, it's... the red light is still there. It's not changing.

Agent: Alright, let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, which is good news. Now let's plug the router back in as well.

Customer: Done. (pause) Still showing that red light on the modem though.

Agent: Yeah, I see. So after the reboot, it's still red. Let me ask you this—do you see the power cable connected securely to the modem? Sometimes these can come loose.

Customer: Let me check... yeah, it looks pretty secure to me.

Agent: And is it plugged into a working outlet? Can you maybe try a different outlet if there's one nearby?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, actually, let me try that. I've got another outlet right here. (pause, sound of unplugging) Okay, trying the other outlet. (pause) Still red.

Agent: Hmm, that's not ideal. Okay, when you look at the modem, is there any damage to it? Any burn marks or anything unusual?

Customer: No, it looks fine. Looks normal to me.

Agent: Alright. And this modem—have you had any storms or power outages recently in your area?

Customer: You know, actually, we did have a pretty bad storm last night. Lost power for a couple hours. But the internet was working fine this morning, so I didn't think that was related.

Agent: That could definitely be it. After a power surge, sometimes the modem can be damaged even if everything looks okay externally. Let me check here... (typing sounds) Okay, I'm also not seeing any activity on your line, which confirms there's no connection being established right now. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Is the modem broken?

Agent: It's looking that way, unfortunately. The storm surge may have damaged the internal components. That's actually not uncommon after what you described. Now, the good news is that we can get you a replacement modem. Let me see what our options are here. (typing sounds, pause) 

Customer: How long would that take? Like, when could I get it?

Agent: So we have a few options. We can expedite a replacement and have it to you by tomorrow, or we can schedule a technician to come out and bring a modem with them. That would be within the next two to three business days. There would be a $15 expedited fee if you want it tomorrow.

Customer: Is there any way to get it today? I really need the internet today.

Agent: Let me check what we have available... (pause, typing) Unfortunately, today isn't available for expedited shipping. The soonest we can do is tomorrow morning. But I can definitely waive that $15 fee for you given the circumstances. How does that sound?

Customer: I mean... I guess it's better than nothing. But this is really inconvenient. Is there anything else we can try right now?

Agent: You know, let me try one more thing. Sometimes if the modem went into a protection mode, we can try a hard reset. This will take about five minutes, but it's worth trying. Do you want to give it a shot?

Customer: Sure, yeah, let's try it.

Agent: Okay, so on the back of the modem, there's a small reset button. It's usually recessed, so you might need a paperclip or a pen to press it. Can you locate that?

Customer: (pause) I think I see it... yeah, there's a little button back here.

Agent: Perfect. I want you to hold that button down for about fifteen seconds while the modem is plugged in. Go ahead and do that now.

Customer: (pause) Okay... holding it... (longer pause) Still holding... (pause) Alright, I've been holding it for like thirty seconds now.

Agent: Good, you can release it now. Let's give it about a minute to reboot and see if we get any different lights.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) Nope. Still just the red light. Nothing's changed.

Agent: (sigh) Alright, unfortunately it looks like that didn't do it. I think we're looking at a hardware failure. I'm confident that modem needs to be replaced. Let me get you set up with that overnight shipping.

Customer: ...Yeah, okay. Can you at least make sure it gets here in the morning?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll put a note on the order for priority morning delivery. Let me just get a couple pieces of information from you to confirm. Your current email is still [inaudible]@yahoo.com?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm setting this up now. You should receive a tracking number via email within the next hour. The replacement modem will arrive tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. And again, I've waived the expedited fee, so there's no charge for that.

Customer: Okay... I guess that's something. When I get the new modem, do I just plug it in the same way?

Agent: Yes, exactly. It's the same setup. Just follow the same connections you had before. When it arrives, if you have any issues getting it installed or if the internet still isn't working, just give us a call back and we'll walk through it.

Customer: Alright, I will. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. And again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We really appreciate your patience with us. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll just wait for the modem tomorrow.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
