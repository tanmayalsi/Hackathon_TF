Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, my name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get this fixed. I've got work stuff I need to do today.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'm definitely going to help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And what's the best name to have on file for this account?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Alright, I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Riverside area. So, just to clarify—when you say your internet is down, is it completely not working, or are you seeing any lights on your modem?

Customer: No, nothing. The modem is just... completely dark. Like, no lights at all. I unplugged it this morning thinking maybe it would help, and when I plugged it back in, nothing happened.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me walk you through a few troubleshooting steps here. First, can you check the power cable going into the modem? Make sure it's firmly connected both to the modem and to the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. It looks... I mean, it's plugged in. Let me push it in a little more to be sure.

Agent: Good idea.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I pushed it in. Still nothing though. The modem's still completely dark.

Agent: Alright. And just to verify—do you have a separate router, or is the modem also your router?

Customer: I think they're... I think they're the same thing? It's the gray box you guys installed.

Agent: That's the all-in-one unit, so yes, they're combined. That's fine. So let's try a hard reset. I want you to unplug the modem from power for about 30 seconds, okay?

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Let's give it a good 30 seconds. (pause) While we're waiting, have there been any storms in your area recently, or any power outages?

Customer: Uh, well actually, yeah. There was a pretty bad storm last night. Like, around midnight. The power went out for maybe an hour or so.

Agent: That could definitely be related. Power surges can sometimes damage the equipment. Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) ...Nope. Still nothing. Not a single light.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, um... (typing sounds) Let me check something on my end. Have you had any recent service changes or maintenance done on your account?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine yesterday.

Agent: Right. Let me see if there's anything showing on the line side. (pause) I'm not seeing any issues with your line in our system. Okay, so here's what I want to try. Can you locate where the cable comes into your house? Usually it's on the side of the house or in the garage area?

Customer: Yeah, I can do that. Hang on. (pause) I'm looking... okay, I can see where the cable comes in. It's going into the side of the house near my garage.

Agent: Perfect. Can you check the connection where that cable meets your home? Is it screwed in tightly?

Customer: (pause) It looks pretty tight to me. I'm trying to turn it and... no, it's not budging.

Agent: Okay, that's good. So that connection is secure. James, I want to ask—when you look at the modem itself, is there any visible damage? Like, does it look burnt or melted anywhere, or any burn marks?

Customer: (pause) Um... let me see. Actually, now that you mention it, there's like a slightly... the plastic on the back looks a little warped. Like, melted kind of? Is that... is that bad?

Agent: Yeah, that does sound like it could be heat damage, probably from that power surge you mentioned. Unfortunately, that would mean the modem itself is damaged and not salvageable. Let me pull up your account and see what we can do here. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, so I'm checking our current promotions. It looks like we do have a replacement option for you, but I want to make sure we've exhausted everything first. Let me just do one more thing—can you double-check that the power outlet itself is working? Maybe plug a lamp or something else into it?

Customer: (pause) Good idea. Okay, I got a lamp. (pause) Yeah, the lamp turns on fine, so the outlet is working.

Agent: Alright, so it's definitely the modem. (pause) Unfortunately, James, it sounds like your modem was damaged in that power surge last night. The good news is that we can get you a replacement unit shipped out, typically within 3 to 5 business days. There will be a replacement fee of $99, but—

Customer: $99? Really? I mean, this wasn't my fault. The storm knocked out my power.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) (pause) You know what, let me connect you with my supervisor real quick. They might have some options available for situations like this. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, I guess.

Agent: Thank you, James. I'm going to put you on a brief hold here.

(hold music plays for about 45 seconds)

Agent: Alright, James, I'm back. I spoke with my supervisor, and unfortunately for damage from external sources like power surges, we do typically charge the replacement fee since it's outside of our normal service coverage. However, I do want to get that replacement unit processed for you right away so you can get back online as soon as possible.

Customer: So there's nothing you can do about the fee?

Agent: I wish I could waive it entirely, but with the power surge damage, it would fall under hardware damage. What I can do is I can expedite the shipping at no extra cost, so you should get it in 2 to 3 business days instead of 5. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) I guess that's something. So what's the process?

Agent: Okay, so I'll go ahead and authorize the replacement modem. We'll ship it out to your address on file, and you should receive it within 2 to 3 business days. Once you get it, the installation is pretty straightforward—just plug in the power, connect the cable line, and it should activate automatically. You'll get an email confirmation with tracking information.

Customer: And I'm definitely going to be charged $99?

Agent: Yes, that will be $99 for the replacement unit. It'll be added to your next billing cycle.

Customer: Alright. I mean, I'm not thrilled about it, but I guess I don't have a choice.

Agent: I really do understand, and I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this without the replacement. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. So how long until I get it?

Agent: As I mentioned, 2 to 3 business days with the expedited shipping. You'll get that tracking email, so you'll be able to see exactly when it arrives. And just so you have this for your records, your confirmation number is FRN-885-7743-B.

Customer: Okay, got it. FRN-885-7743-B.

Agent: That's correct. And James, just one more thing—when you do get the new modem, if you're having any trouble getting it set up, please don't hesitate to call us back. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online today. We really appreciate your patience and your business with Frontier.

Customer: Yeah, no problem. Goodbye.

Agent: Goodbye, James. Have a great day.
