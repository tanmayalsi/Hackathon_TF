# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, uh, thanks for picking up. So my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I'm working from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be, especially when you're trying to work. Let me pull up your account real quick so we can get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's... (pause) ...let me grab my bill real quick. Hold on.

Agent: No problem, take your time.

Customer: Okay, so it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm looking at the account now. And what's the best phone number to reach you at if we get disconnected?

Customer: It's the same number, 555-0847.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went down about an hour ago. Have you had any recent storms in your area, or did anything else change recently?

Customer: No, no storms. It was working fine this morning. I was actually using it for a Zoom call and then it just... dropped. And I can't get back on.

Agent: Okay, let me check on our end first to see if there's anything we can see from here. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area currently, so it's likely something with your modem or router. Let me walk you through a few quick troubleshooting steps. First, can you locate your modem?

Customer: Yeah, it's right next to my desk. I can see it.

Agent: Great. So what I want you to do is look at the lights on the front of the modem. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing?

Customer: Uh, okay... so there's a power light and it's green. And then there's... there's like an internet light that's... red? Or orange maybe? It's definitely not green.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on, which is good. That orange or red light on the internet—that typically means there's a connectivity issue. Let's try doing a quick restart. What I want you to do is unplug the modem from the wall outlet, and then wait for about thirty seconds.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Just hang tight for thirty seconds. That'll give everything a chance to reset.

Customer: Sure, I'm just... waiting. (long pause) Okay, it's been about thirty seconds.

Agent: Good. Go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in... okay, it's in. (pause) The power light came back on, and now it's... uh... it's still orange. Still not working.

Agent: Alright, that's okay. Sometimes it takes a minute or two to boot back up. Let's give it just a moment. While we're waiting, let me also check—do you have a separate router, or is everything going through the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I've got a separate router. It's a wireless one. The modem is connected to it with an ethernet cable.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful to know. So is your router powered on?

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) ...I'm looking at it now. It looks like it's off? That's weird. Let me turn it on. (pause) Okay, there we go, it's powering up.

Agent: Good, good. So while that's booting up, let me take another look at things on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, so I'm checking the modem and... I'm actually not seeing it communicating with our network at all right now. Do you have any other devices you could check to see if they have internet?

Customer: I could try my phone. Let me see if it connects to the wifi. (pause) No, the wifi network isn't even showing up. Usually it broadcasts, but I don't see it.

Agent: Okay, so the router isn't broadcasting the network yet. That could mean it's still starting up. But the bigger issue is that the modem itself isn't connecting to us. I'm wondering if there's a line issue. Let me ask you—do you see the modem cable coming from the wall? The coaxial cable?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's the... it's the thick one, right?

Agent: The white cable, looks kind of like a small TV cord?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I see it. Is something wrong with it?

Agent: Can you follow that cable and see where it goes into the wall? Just make sure it's... it's nice and snug, not loose or anything.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm checking it. It looks like it's... well, it's plugged in, but now that I'm looking at it, it does seem like it might be a little loose. Let me tighten it. (pause) Yeah, I'm turning it to the right. Feels a bit tighter now.

Agent: Good, good. Do you see any change on the modem lights?

Customer: (pause) ...No, still orange. Still nothing.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me try something else. Is there a reset button on the modem at all? It's usually a small button, might be recessed.

Customer: Let me look... yeah, I see a small button on the back. It says "reset" next to it.

Agent: Alright, I'm going to have you press that, but I want to warn you—this will reset the modem to factory settings, so we'll need to reprogram it. But let's try it. Go ahead and press and hold that button for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm pressing it. (pause) The lights are all flashing now. (pause) Alright, letting go.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about two minutes to fully boot up and re-establish its connection with our network.

Customer: (pause) Okay, still waiting. (pause) Still... (pause) ...no change. Still orange.

Agent: I know this is frustrating. Let me check on my end again. (typing sounds) (longer pause) ...Okay, so I'm still not seeing the modem register on our network. I'm looking at the signal levels and honestly, they're not coming through at all from your location. I want to ask—have there been any changes to your setup recently? Did you move anything, or has anything been damaged?

Customer: No, everything's been the same. I mean, it was working perfectly yesterday.

Agent: Right. Well, what I'm suspecting at this point is that either the modem itself may have failed, or there's an issue with the line coming into your house from our network. Unfortunately, I'm not able to diagnose the external line from here. (pause) I think what we need to do is get a technician out to your place to take a look at both the modem and the line.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back soon. I have calls this afternoon.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability for you. (typing sounds) (pause) So it looks like we could get someone out to you tomorrow, sometime between 12 and 4 PM. We could also potentially get someone out today if you're available, but that would be later this evening, around 6 PM.

Customer: Can I do tomorrow? This afternoon won't work anyway if I don't have internet right now.

Agent: Tomorrow between 12 and 4 works. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, I've got you down for tomorrow from noon to 4 PM. A technician will come out and check the modem and the external line. Is that address still... (reads address from screen) ...?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, the best number to reach you at is still 555-0847?

Customer: That's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you should expect someone tomorrow between noon and 4 PM. They'll take a look at everything. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. This is just really inconvenient, but... I guess there's not much we can do right now, huh?

Agent: I wish I could get it fixed remotely for you right now. These are definitely frustrating situations. But the good news is we'll get someone out there tomorrow and get you back online. I'll make a note on your account about what we tried today so the technician knows exactly where we left off.

Customer: Okay, well, I appreciate that. Thanks for trying.

Agent: No problem at all. Thanks for your patience, and sorry again for the inconvenience. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's all.

Agent: Alright, take care, and we'll see you tomorrow!

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now!
