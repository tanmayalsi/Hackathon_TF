Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So my internet just went out completely about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging the router and everything.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account here... and I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan in the Riverside area. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned you've already tried unplugging the router. When exactly did you first notice the internet wasn't working?

Customer: Um, it was around 2 o'clock this afternoon. I was working from home and just suddenly everything dropped. Like, no connection at all.

Agent: Okay, and when you say you unplugged the router, how long did you leave it unplugged before plugging it back in?

Customer: I don't know, maybe thirty seconds? Should I have left it longer?

Agent: Yeah, actually, let's try that again. What I want you to do is unplug the router—that's the device with the lights on it—and also unplug the modem, which should be right near it. Leave them both unplugged for about three full minutes. That gives the system time to completely reset.

Customer: Okay, hold on... (background noise) Yeah, I'm unplugging both of them now. I'll wait. (pause) Alright, three minutes... (longer pause) ...okay, it's been three minutes.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug the modem back in first, and then wait about a minute for it to fully boot up. You should see some lights come on.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, plugging it back in... (pause) Yeah, I'm seeing lights now. There's a blue light and a green light that came on.

Agent: Excellent. That's what we want to see. Now go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) Got it. Okay, now I'm waiting for it to restart... (pause) The lights are blinking now. Is that normal?

Agent: Yeah, that's normal. The lights will blink for a bit while it's connecting. That should take about a minute or two. Go ahead and try connecting to your WiFi network now and see if you're getting online.

Customer: (pause) Uh... I'm looking at my WiFi networks and... I'm not seeing my Frontier network. Let me try searching again...

Agent: Hmm, okay. While you're doing that, let me ask you—have there been any recent storms in your area? Sometimes we can lose connection due to weather issues.

Customer: No, it's actually been really nice out today. No rain or anything.

Agent: Okay, that rules that out. Can you still not see the WiFi network?

Customer: No, nothing. It's weird. Usually it just pops right up. I can see my neighbor's network and a couple others, but not mine.

Agent: Alright. Let's try a different approach. Can you check the back of your modem for me? I want you to look at the cables going into it. There should be one coming from the wall—that's the fiber line—and one ethernet cable going to the router. Can you verify both of those are plugged in securely?

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I'm looking... The one from the wall is definitely in there. The ethernet cable from the modem to the router is also plugged in. They both look fine.

Agent: Okay, good. One more thing—on the front of the modem, you should see a light that says "Online" or maybe just shows a fiber symbol. Is that light on and either solid green or blue?

Customer: (pause) Um, no. That one's actually red.

Agent: Red? Okay, that's telling us the modem isn't detecting a connection from the network. That could mean a few things. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check if there are any outages in your area. This should just take a minute.

Customer: Yeah, sure, go ahead.

Agent: (hold music plays) (pause) Okay, I'm back. I'm not seeing any active outages reported in the Riverside area, so that's not it. Let me try something else. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem from here. This might take a moment.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...nothing really happened. The light's still red.

Agent: Yeah, it might take a few minutes to process. While we're waiting, let me ask you—have you made any changes to your setup recently? Moved anything around or had any work done?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine this morning.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm still not seeing the modem come online from my end. This is a bit unusual. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you do a hard reset on the modem itself? There should be a small reset button, usually recessed, somewhere on the device.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, let me look... Yeah, I think I see it. It's really tiny, right?

Agent: That's the one. You might need a paperclip or a pen to press it since it's recessed. Just hold it down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (background noise) Alright, I'm holding it... still holding... (pause) Okay, released it. Now what?

Agent: Now let's give it another minute to restart and see if that online light changes.

Customer: (pause) ...Nope. Still red. This is really frustrating. I have a conference call in like an hour.

Agent: I completely understand. (pause) Okay, so at this point, I'm thinking the issue might be with the modem itself or possibly with the fiber line coming into your home. Unfortunately, that's something we'd need to have a technician come out and take a look at to diagnose properly.

Customer: Are you serious? How long would that take?

Agent: Let me check our availability... (typing sounds) I'm seeing we could have someone out to you as early as tomorrow morning between 8 and 12. Or we have later appointments on Tuesday if that works better for you.

Customer: Tomorrow morning? That's... yeah, I guess that works. I just wish we could figure it out over the phone.

Agent: I know, believe me, I wish so too. But when it's a hardware issue or a line issue, we really need someone to physically check it out. The good news is our techs are usually pretty quick. Is tomorrow morning okay for you?

Customer: Yeah, tomorrow morning is fine. Let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. Can you confirm the best number to reach you at?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Great, I have that. So to recap, we have a technician appointment scheduled for tomorrow, Wednesday, between 8 AM and 12 PM at your Riverside address. You'll receive a confirmation text and email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you so much for your patience, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get you back online tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye!
