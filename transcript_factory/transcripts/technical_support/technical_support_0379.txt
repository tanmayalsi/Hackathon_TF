Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I'm working from home today and it's been offline for like two hours now.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be, especially when you're trying to work. Let me help you troubleshoot this. First, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... hold on. (rustling sounds) It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: Michael Torres.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got your account pulled up here. I'm seeing you're on our Fiber 500 plan at 4829 Maple Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So your internet went down around this morning. Can you tell me what you've noticed? Are all the lights on your modem working, or do you see anything unusual?

Customer: Um... (pause) Well, the modem's got some lights on it, but I'm not entirely sure which ones are supposed to be on, to be honest. I don't really look at it that much.

Agent: That's totally fine. That's what I'm here for. Can you go ahead and look at the modem right now for me? It should be somewhere near your router, usually.

Customer: Yeah, okay, one second. (footsteps) Alright, I'm looking at it. So there's a power light and it's green. Um, there's an internet light and that one's... red. And there's a WiFi light that's green.

Agent: Okay, so the internet light is red. That's actually really helpful information. That tells me we're not getting a signal from our network on that line. Before we go too deep, let me ask—did anything happen this morning? Like, did you have a power outage, or did you restart anything?

Customer: No, I don't think so. The power's been fine. I just... I came downstairs this morning and everything was already off basically.

Agent: Understood. Alright, here's what we're gonna do. Let's do a hard reset on the modem. Can you locate the power cable?

Customer: Yeah, I can see it. It's right there.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and unplug it from the back of the modem. Just pull it out.

Customer: (pause) Done. It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about 30 seconds while it powers down completely. Just give it a half minute.

Customer: (pause) Alright, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug that power cable back in.

Customer: (plugging sound) It's plugging back in now.

Agent: Perfect. It's gonna take a minute or two to boot back up. While we're waiting, can you tell me—are you using WiFi or are you connected with an ethernet cable?

Customer: I'm using WiFi.

Agent: Okay, got it. So we should see that WiFi light stay green. Go ahead and give it another 30 seconds or so to fully boot up.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Um, so the power light's still green. The WiFi light's green. But the internet light... it's still red.

Agent: It's still red? Okay. (pause) That's... alright. Let me check something here on my end. (typing sounds) I'm pulling up your service status. Do you know if there are any outages in your area? Actually, let me check that. (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any outages reported in your neighborhood right now, so that's good news.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, my modem should have internet then?

Agent: It should, yeah. The fact that the internet light is red means the modem isn't receiving a signal from our network. Um, let me ask you something. Do you see a cable that goes from the wall into the modem? Like, a coaxial cable? It's usually a white or black cable.

Customer: Oh, uh... yeah, I see it. It's going into the back.

Agent: Okay, good. Can you try unplugging that cable from the modem and plugging it back in? Make sure it's really snug.

Customer: (pause) Sure, I can do that. (plugging sounds) Okay, it's back in. And I'm really pushing it tight.

Agent: (pause) Great. Give it another 20 seconds or so to recognize the signal again.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Um... still red.

Agent: Still showing red. (pause) Alright, Michael, let me... let me try a couple more things here. Can you look at where that cable comes out of the wall? Do you see any splitters or anything like that on the cable?

Customer: I... I'm not really sure what I'm looking at, to be honest. There's like a box thing on the wall?

Agent: Okay, that might be a splitter or a connection box. Is the cable coming in from outside the house and then splitting, or...?

Customer: I think so? Yeah, it looks like it comes from outside and then there's this junction box thing.

Agent: Okay, that's pretty normal. Um, I'm just trying to figure out where the issue is. Let me check something. (typing sounds) I'm showing your modem was last online about... two hours ago, which matches what you said about this morning. And I'm not seeing any technical issues on our network side at the moment. (pause) This could be a few different things. It could be a line issue, or it could be something with the modem itself.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: Well, here's what I'd like to try. I'm going to power cycle your modem from my end here. That's basically a remote restart. It's different from just unplugging it. Let me do that. (typing sounds) Alright, I've initiated the restart from the network. Give it about a minute to reboot.

Customer: Okay, I'm watching it. (pause) The lights are going off... and... (pause) They're coming back on. Power's green, WiFi's green, but... (trailing off) ...the internet light's still red.

Agent: It's still not showing the internet signal. (pause) Okay, Michael, I've tried the basic troubleshooting steps and unfortunately the modem is still not registering a connection to our network. This is pointing to either a line issue between the wall and our network, or it could be a modem hardware failure. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to your location to do a proper diagnostic.

Customer: Okay... so, like, how long is that gonna take? I really need to get working today.

Agent: I totally understand. Let me see what appointments we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest I can get someone out there is tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I can't use WiFi today at all?

Agent: Well, I'm limited on what I can do remotely at this point. If you have a mobile hotspot on your phone, that could be an option to get you through the day, but I can't get the Frontier line working from here. The technician tomorrow should be able to identify and fix the issue.

Customer: (sighs) Alright, I guess I'll do the mobile hotspot. So you'll schedule me for tomorrow?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) So you're all set for tomorrow, December 14th, between 12 and 4 PM. The technician will meet you at 4829 Maple Drive. Is there a best number to reach you at if they need to?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147, the same number.

Agent: Perfect. You'll receive a confirmation email and possibly a text reminder as well. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone, Michael. I know it's inconvenient. But the technician should have you back up and running tomorrow. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great day.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
