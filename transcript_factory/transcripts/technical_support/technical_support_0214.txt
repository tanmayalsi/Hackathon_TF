Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my landline.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147... got it. And can I also get your name for verification?

Customer: James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. So you're saying your internet has been down since this morning? Walk me through what happened. Did it just stop working, or did you notice anything unusual before it went out?

Customer: Yeah, so I was working, everything was fine, and then around 9 AM I just... nothing. I looked at the router and the lights are all kind of blinking weird. Like, some of them are red, I think? I'm not really sure what that means.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Let me ask you a few quick questions. First, do you have power to your modem and router? Are they both plugged in?

Customer: Yeah, they're both plugged in. I can see them lit up. But like I said, the lights look weird.

Agent: Got it. And when you say the lights are red and blinking... Are all the lights red, or just specific ones?

Customer: (pause) Um, I think it's the one that says Internet? Or maybe it's all of them. (laughs nervously) I'm not great with this stuff.

Agent: No worries at all. That's what I'm here for. Can you do me a favor and take a look at the front of the modem? There should be a label that tells you which light is which.

Customer: (pause) Okay, give me a second. (background noise of moving around) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. The power light is green. The Internet light is... red. And it's blinking.

Agent: Okay, so the Internet light is red and blinking. That typically means the modem isn't connecting to our network. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem from power? Just pull the cord out of the back.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Done.

Agent: Great. Now let's leave that unplugged for about 30 seconds. Just give it a moment to fully power down.

Customer: Okay... (long pause) How long now?

Agent: We're almost there. Just another ten or fifteen seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's back in. So now what?

Agent: Now we just want to wait for it to boot back up. It should take about two to three minutes. You'll see the lights cycling through different colors. Just let me know when the Internet light turns green.

Customer: (pause) It's still red. Like, bright red. Still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Okay. How long has it been since you plugged it in?

Customer: I don't know, maybe like a minute?

Agent: That should be enough time. Um, let me ask you this. Do you have any cable coming out of the wall into the modem? There should be a coaxial cable, it kind of looks like...

Customer: Oh yeah, I see it. It's the thick one, right?

Agent: Exactly. Is that cable plugged in securely? Can you wiggle it gently and make sure it's tight?

Customer: (pause) It seems pretty tight to me. I don't want to like, break it or anything.

Agent: You won't break it, I promise. Just give it a gentle clockwise turn to make sure it's snug.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I did that. The light is still red though.

Agent: (typing sounds) Still red. Alright. Have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: Not that I know of. Everything was working fine yesterday. Just woke up this morning and... nothing.

Agent: Understood. Let me check our system here to see if there are any reported outages in your area. (pause) What's your zip code?

Customer: It's 94102.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any active outages reported on our end. That's interesting. Okay, let's try a few more things. Can you check behind your modem and see if there are any other cables plugged in? There might be an Ethernet cable going to a router.

Customer: Oh, yeah. There's a cable that goes from the modem to another box. That's the router, right?

Agent: Right, exactly. Can you unplug that cable from both the modem and the router?

Customer: (pause) The modem end or the...?

Agent: Actually, let's unplug it from both ends to be safe. Just disconnect it completely.

Customer: Okay. (sounds of unplugging) Done.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait another 30 seconds and then plug that cable back in. That'll help reset the connection between the two devices.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm plugging it back in. (pause) Still red.

Agent: (sighs) Okay. Let me have you try something else. Can you restart your router as well? There should be a power button or you can unplug it.

Customer: You want me to unplug this one too?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and unplug the router.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. Now what?

Agent: Let's wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, plugged back in. (pause) Nope. Still nothing. The modem light is still red.

Agent: (pause) I'm looking at your account here, and I'm not seeing any issues on our end. The service should be active. Let me ask you... when you look at the back of the modem, are there any lights on the right side that might indicate a connection issue?

Customer: [inaudible] I'm trying to see the back. There's a bunch of ports back here. The cables are plugged into a couple of them.

Agent: Okay, don't worry about the back too much. I think at this point, we might be looking at a hardware issue with the modem itself, or possibly a line problem that we'd need to investigate further. I think what we should do is schedule a technician to come out and take a look.

Customer: Really? How long would that take? I kind of need my internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) We can get someone out to you as early as tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have later slots available next week.

Customer: Tomorrow? Can you do today? This is kind of urgent for me.

Agent: Unfortunately, I'm not seeing any same-day appointments available in your area. The next available is tomorrow morning. I know that's not ideal, but the technician will be able to diagnose the issue and get you back up and running.

Customer: (frustrated) Yeah, okay. I guess I'll have to take tomorrow morning. That's really not ideal, but... what else can I do?

Agent: I really do apologize for the inconvenience. Let me get you set up for tomorrow. So that'll be tomorrow, [inaudible] between 8 AM and 12 PM. Is that window okay for you?

Customer: Yeah, fine. That works.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation email shortly, and a technician will be out to see you then. In the meantime, if you notice anything else or if the internet does come back on, give us a call back. But I have a feeling this might be something we need to look at in person.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Okay, James. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. We'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: You have a good day. Bye now.
