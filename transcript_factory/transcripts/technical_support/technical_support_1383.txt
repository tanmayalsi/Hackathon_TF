# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I work from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember approximately what time that happened?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I'd say around 8 or 8:30. I tried turning the modem off and back on, like, three times already, but nothing's working.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on doing that. Sometimes that does the trick. Let me ask you a few questions here. When you say the internet is down, are you seeing any lights on your modem right now?

Customer: Yeah, actually. Um... there's a few lights on. There's like a green one and... (pause) ...wait, is there supposed to be a blue one? I'm not really looking at it that carefully.

Agent: Okay, so we might be getting somewhere. Can you take a closer look for me? The modem should be showing several LED lights. I'm looking for the power light, the internet light, and the WiFi light. What colors are you seeing?

Customer: Right, okay, so the power light is green and solid. The internet light is... it's blinking orange. And the WiFi one is green.

Agent: Alright, so the blinking orange on the internet light tells me the modem is having trouble connecting to our network. This could be a few things. Let me have you try something for me. Can you unplug the modem completely, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in?

Customer: Yeah, I can do that right now. (pause) Okay, pulling it out... (longer pause) ...and waiting... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. And while that's booting back up, can you tell me—have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time something like this has happened?

Customer: No, this is definitely the first time. Internet's been pretty solid since we switched to Frontier last year. Um, it's been good. This is the first real problem.

Agent: Good to know. Okay, give it another minute or so to fully boot up. (typing sounds) I'm checking your account here and I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area at the moment. So it might be something specific to your connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, uh... I'm looking at it now and... the internet light is still blinking orange. It's not changing.

Agent: Hmm, alright. Let me try a different approach. Can you check if there are any loose cables connected to the modem? Sometimes they can come unplugged, especially if there's been any activity near where it's located.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm checking behind... yeah, everything looks pretty plugged in. The coax cable and the ethernet cable, they both seem fine.

Agent: Alright, good. Now let me have you try a factory reset on the modem. This is a bit more involved than what we did before. There should be a small reset button on the back of the modem. It's usually recessed in pretty far, so you might need a paperclip or a pen to press it.

Customer: Okay, okay, I see it. There's a little button back here. (pause) Do I just hold it down?

Agent: Yeah, hold it down for about 10 seconds. You'll see the lights flash and reset. After that, it'll take a couple of minutes to fully restart and reconnect. Let me stay on the line with you while that happens.

Customer: Alright, pressing it now. (pause) Yeah, the lights are all going crazy. (pause) Okay, let me just... wait for it to boot back up.

Agent: (pause) Take your time. This usually takes about two or three minutes.

Customer: (longer pause) ...Yeah, so the light is still doing the orange blinking thing. This isn't working.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm pulling up the diagnostics for your modem and... hmm. (pause) It looks like the modem might not be properly registering on our network. That could indicate a hardware issue or something on our infrastructure side that's affecting just your line.

Customer: So like... what does that mean? How long until I get internet back?

Agent: Well, I have a couple more things I want to try before we determine next steps. Let me see if I can remotely restart your connection on our end. Just give me one moment here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm sending a command to reset your connection now. Can you check the modem again?

Customer: (pause) Nope, still orange. Still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I'm not seeing that take effect. Okay, look, at this point I think we might be looking at either a hardware issue with the modem itself or possibly a line issue on our end. I'd like to send a technician out to take a look. They'd be able to do some more detailed diagnostics and either replace the modem or check the line coming into your home.

Customer: How soon can someone come out? I really need this working. I have calls scheduled later today.

Agent: Let me check availability. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at our technician schedule for your area. (pause) We have an opening tomorrow between 1 and 3 PM. Or there's another slot on Thursday morning between 9 and 11 AM.

Customer: Tomorrow at 1 PM would be better than Thursday. Can I get that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I have you down for tomorrow, Wednesday the 27th, between 1 and 3 PM. A technician will come out to your address at 415 Maple Drive. The call will come from a technician around an hour before they arrive to confirm they're on their way.

Customer: Okay, that works. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Like, will my internet come back on its own or...?

Agent: That's a good question. The internet might spontaneously reconnect, but based on what we've tried, I wouldn't count on that. You're welcome to keep trying the troubleshooting steps—restarting the modem—but honestly, I think the technician is going to be your best bet. They'll be able to figure out exactly what's going on.

Customer: Alright, I guess I'll just have to work around it for today. This is frustrating, but I appreciate your help trying to troubleshoot this.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get it resolved over the phone. I know that's not ideal, especially when you work from home. But I have full confidence that our technician will be able to get you back online tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... make sure that appointment is solid, okay?

Agent: You've got my word. Your technician appointment is all set for tomorrow from 1 to 3 PM. You should receive a confirmation text or email shortly. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience today.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. I'll talk to you later.

Agent: Have a good day.
