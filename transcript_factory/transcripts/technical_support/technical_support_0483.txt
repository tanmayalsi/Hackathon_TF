Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I need to get this fixed pretty soon.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I have your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. Just to confirm, is this for the residence at 2341 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet has been down since this morning. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you able to see any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, yeah, the modem has some lights on it, but they're... I don't know, they're just blinking red or orange or something. It doesn't look normal to me.

Agent: Okay, so the lights are red or orange. That's actually really helpful information. Can you tell me which lights specifically are red? Is it all of them or just certain ones?

Customer: Uh, let me look... (pause) Okay, so there's like a power light that's on, but then there's another one that's blinking red, and I think it says "internet" or something next to it?

Agent: Right, so the power light is solid on, but you have a red blinking light on the internet indicator. That typically means there's no connection coming from our side. Have you tried unplugging the modem yet and plugging it back in?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, let's give it a shot. Go ahead and unplug it, and then wait about thirty seconds before you plug it back in. I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: Okay... (background noise of unplugging) Alright, it's unplugged. I'm counting... thirty seconds. (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (electronic sound)

Agent: Great. Now we're going to give it about two to three minutes to fully boot back up. While we wait, let me just check if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end, which is good news. That means it's likely an issue specific to your connection.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Um, so how long do you think this is gonna take? I have a Zoom call in like forty minutes.

Agent: I understand. Let's see how the modem does here in just a second. Are the lights looking any different now?

Customer: (pause) Not really, no. Still got that red blinking light. Actually, you know what, it might be slightly less red than before, but it's still definitely blinking.

Agent: Hmm, still blinking. Okay, let's try a different approach. Can you do a hard reset on the modem? On the back, there should be a small reset button. You'll need a paperclip or something thin to press it and hold it for about ten seconds.

Customer: A reset button? I'm not... let me see... (pause) Oh, yeah, I see it. It's tiny though. Um, let me grab a paperclip... (rustling sounds) Okay, I'm gonna press it now. (pause) Holding it... ten seconds. Okay, releasing now.

Agent: Alright, the modem should restart. Let's give it another few minutes to boot up completely.

Customer: (pause) This is taking a while. Is this normal?

Agent: Yeah, after a hard reset it does take a bit longer sometimes. It's actually going through a full initialization process. Let's just give it a moment... (pause) How are we looking now?

Customer: (pause) Still red and blinking. This doesn't seem like it's working.

Agent: Yeah, I'm noticing that too. Okay, let me try something else here. I'm going to check the line status from our end... (typing sounds) Interesting. So I'm actually not seeing your modem registered on our network at all right now. That could mean the signal isn't making it to the modem, or there's an issue with the connection from our infrastructure.

Customer: What does that mean? Is it on your end or my end?

Agent: That's a good question. It could be either. Let me ask you this—have you noticed any damage to the cables outside your house? Or did anything change recently with your setup?

Customer: Not that I know of. I mean, we had that windstorm last week, but I haven't noticed anything out of place. Should I go check?

Agent: That's actually a really good idea, especially with the windstorm. Can you go take a look? Just check if any of the cables coming to your house look damaged or disconnected.

Customer: Okay, one sec... (sound of footsteps, door opening, [inaudible] for a moment) Alright, I'm looking at the outside of the house now. Um... (pause) I don't see anything obviously damaged, but, you know, I'm not exactly an expert. The cables look pretty normal to me.

Agent: Okay, that's good. Did you happen to see a gray or tan-colored box mounted on the side of your house or on a pole nearby? That would be the connection box from our network.

Customer: Yeah, I see a gray box over there. Um, it's mounted on the side of the house, about halfway up the wall.

Agent: Good. Can you see if any cables are loose or disconnected from it?

Customer: (pause) No, everything looks like it's connected. I'm not messing with it though—I don't want to break anything.

Agent: No, that's smart. You're doing great. Let me check something on my end here... (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so looking at the network diagnostics, I'm seeing that we should have signal reaching your location. Let me try to send a signal reset to your line. This should only take a moment. (pause) Alright, I've initiated that. Now, can you go back inside and check that modem again? See if anything changes?

Customer: (sound of footsteps) Okay, I'm back inside. Looking at the modem... (pause) Nope. Still the same. Red light blinking away.

Agent: Okay... (pause) Yeah, unfortunately, I'm not seeing that change on my end either. At this point, I think we might be dealing with something that requires an in-person technician visit. The issue could be with the optical network terminal outside, or there might be a damaged line somewhere between the street and your home.

Customer: So you're saying you can't fix this over the phone?

Agent: I wish I could, but based on what we're seeing, I really think we need to get a technician out there to do a proper inspection. They'll be able to check all the hardware and see if there's any physical damage to the lines.

Customer: (frustrated) Okay... when can you get someone out here? I really need this internet working. I have work stuff.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability... (typing sounds) I can get a technician scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have an opening on Friday afternoon. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning, I guess. I can't wait until Friday.

Agent: Perfect. I've scheduled a technician visit for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM. The reference number is 847392. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess not. I just... I'm pretty disappointed this couldn't be fixed right now.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry we weren't able to resolve it over the phone. But I'm confident our technician will get to the bottom of this tomorrow. If anything changes before then or you have any questions, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and sorry again for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
