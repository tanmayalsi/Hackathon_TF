Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. The last name is Michaels.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Michael with an S... and I've got you here. I see your service address is on Elm Street in Dover. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router? Are they on right now?

Customer: Um, yeah, so the modem is on—it's got some lights on it. Let me look... there's like a green light and a red light, I think. And the router is also on.

Agent: Okay, so we've got a green and a red light. The red light is actually what we want to focus on here. That usually indicates a connection issue. Let's do a quick restart. Can you locate your modem? It should be a small box, probably white or black.

Customer: Yeah, I can see it. It's right there by my TV.

Agent: Great. What I'm going to have you do is unplug the power cable from the back of the modem. Just pull it straight out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, done.

Agent: Perfect. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds before plugging it back in. While we're waiting, let me ask—has anything changed with your setup recently? Any storms in your area last night or anything like that?

Customer: No, no storms. It was just fine yesterday. I was working from home and everything was running great, and then this morning I woke up and nothing. The internet wouldn't even load.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Has it been thirty seconds yet?

Customer: Um, yeah, about there. Plugging it back in now.

Agent: (typing sounds) Good. Now this is going to take about two to three minutes to fully reboot and reconnect. While that's happening, let's check on a couple other things. Are you noticing any loose cables anywhere?

Customer: I... I don't think so? I mean, I don't really mess with any of the cables back there. Everything looks pretty snug from what I can see.

Agent: Okay, that's good. And just to confirm—you're not able to connect to the internet at all right now, correct? Not even on your phone or any wireless devices?

Customer: Right, nothing. My phone has Wi-Fi turned on and it's not connecting either. And I tried unplugging the router too, so...

Agent: Good troubleshooting on your end. (pause) Okay, let's give that modem a few more seconds here... Do you see any lights changing on the modem now?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually I think I see... it looks like it's cycling through colors or something. Is that normal?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. That's normal. That's the modem going through its startup sequence. You should see... ideally you want to see a solid green light and then typically a flashing or steady light on the internet indicator. Give it another thirty seconds or so.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. The green light is staying steady now. But... I still see that red light.

Agent: Hmm, okay. The red light is persisting. That's what we're concerned about. What does that red light say next to it? Is there any text or label?

Customer: Let me see... It says "Internet" next to it.

Agent: Okay, so the Internet indicator is red. That means the modem isn't getting a signal from our network. Um... (typing sounds) Let me check our system here to see if there's anything on our end. (pause) Okay, I'm not showing any outages in your area, and I'm not seeing any alerts on your account. 

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It means the issue is likely either with the modem itself or with the line coming into your house. Have you had any work done recently? Any construction, digging, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing that I'm aware of. This is really weird because like I said, it was working perfectly yesterday.

Agent: I understand. Okay, let me have you try one more thing. I'm going to have you do what's called a factory reset on your modem. Now, this will clear everything out, so I just want to prepare you for that. Do you see a small button on the modem? It might be recessed.

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, I think I do. It's really small, right?

Agent: Yes, exactly. That's the reset button. I'm going to have you hold that button down for about ten seconds. You might need a pen or a paperclip.

Customer: Hold on, let me grab a pen. (pause, background noise of drawer opening) Okay, I've got one. Holding it down now...

Agent: And just keep holding... keep holding...

Customer: How much longer?

Agent: About five more seconds...

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm letting go.

Agent: Alright. Now the modem is going to restart completely. This is going to take a couple minutes. While we wait, let me see if I can try something else on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to send a refresh signal to your modem.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (pause, longer pause) Alright, is the modem still going through its startup?

Customer: Yeah, I see the lights flashing. But actually, um... I'm still not seeing a green internet light. It looks pretty similar to before. Still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Um, that's not ideal. Let me check something. I'm pulling up your service history here. (typing sounds) I don't see any issues flagged recently. Hmm... (pause) Okay, I think at this point we may be dealing with a hardware issue or a line issue that I'm not able to diagnose over the phone. We might need to get a technician out to your place.

Customer: Really? How long is that going to take? I need my internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (pause, typing sounds) Unfortunately, our next available appointment is... (pause) it looks like it would be tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's not... I mean, I have meetings. Can't you get someone out today?

Agent: I wish I could. Let me check one more time. (typing sounds, pause) No, unfortunately we're fully booked today. Tomorrow is the earliest. I know that's not ideal, but it would at least get this resolved for you.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Okay, fine. Tomorrow morning then. But I'm going to need this fixed.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to get that scheduled for you, and I'll make a note on your account that this is urgent. The technician will come out and they'll be able to check the line and the equipment. Is the address 4847 Elm Street still correct for the service visit?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And what's the best number to reach you at? Is it the same number on your account?

Customer: Um, yeah, 555-0147 is fine.

Agent: Alright, I have you scheduled for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM. You should get a confirmation call about an hour before the technician arrives. In the meantime, if anything changes or if you try something else that gets it working, just give us a call back. But it does sound like we might be looking at a hardware replacement or a line issue.

Customer: Okay... I guess I'll wait then. This is really inconvenient.

Agent: I understand, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. We'll get it taken care of tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess not. Just... get someone out here to fix it.

Agent: You got it. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Bye.

Customer: Bye.
