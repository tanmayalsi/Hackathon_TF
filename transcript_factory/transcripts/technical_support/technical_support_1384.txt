# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I'm working from home, so this is kind of a big deal.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm pulling that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: (pause) Got it, David. So your service address is on Maple Street in Portland, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Alright, David. So you're saying your internet went down this morning. Have you been able to restart your equipment at all?

Customer: Well, I... I tried unplugging the modem, like, an hour ago? I left it off for maybe thirty seconds and plugged it back in, but nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's a good first step. Um, let me check the status on our end. (pause) (typing sounds) Are you seeing any lights on the modem right now? Any activity lights?

Customer: Yeah, there's... there's like a red light? It's just solid red. Normally it's like green and blue and stuff, you know?

Agent: Right, right. Okay, so that red light typically indicates a connection issue on our end. But let me walk you through a few things to make sure we've covered everything. Do you have the modem in front of you?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

Agent: Perfect. So I want you to try a full power cycle. Can you unplug the modem and also the router if you have a separate router?

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) How long do I wait?

Agent: Go ahead and wait about two minutes. Just to be safe.

Customer: (pause) Alright, two minutes. (longer pause) Okay, it's been like two minutes. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (background noise of plugging in device) Alright, it's plugged in.

Agent: And give it about thirty to forty seconds to boot up completely.

Customer: (pause) Um... I'm waiting. The lights are coming on now. I see... I see green and then... oh wait, now it's... it's going back to red. It's just... it's red again.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's not what we want to see. Let me check if there's a service issue in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages, but let me look a little deeper. How long have you been a customer with us, David?

Customer: Uh, I think it's been about two years? Maybe a little less.

Agent: Alright. And just to clarify, you're not seeing any internet connection at all, correct? Not on any devices?

Customer: No, nothing. My phone's on cellular right now because obviously WiFi isn't working, and I can't even... like, I can't plug in an ethernet cable to my computer. I tried that too.

Agent: Okay, yeah, that tells me the issue is definitely at the modem. Um, David, I'm going to try something. I'm going to send a reset command to your modem from here. This might take a few minutes to process. You should see the lights flicker. Can you keep an eye on it?

Customer: Yeah, okay. I'm watching it.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, I've sent the command. Let's give it... (pause) ...about three minutes to cycle through.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, so... nothing's happening. It's still just red.

Agent: Still red? (pause) Alright. Um, this is unusual. Let me... let me try one more thing. Can you tell me—do you have a battery backup unit connected to your modem? Like a UPS?

Customer: I don't think so. Let me look... No, I don't see anything like that. It's just plugged directly into the outlet.

Agent: Okay. And when's the last time you noticed the internet working normally?

Customer: It was fine last night. I was streaming shows before I went to bed, and then this morning when I tried to do my morning emails, nothing. So somewhere between like eleven PM and like eight AM it went out.

Agent: (pause) That's helpful. David, I think at this point what we're dealing with might be a hardware failure on the modem itself. Usually when it's stuck on red after all these troubleshooting steps, it indicates the modem isn't able to establish a connection with our network.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: Let me look into your account to see if the modem is owned or leased. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm seeing that the modem is leased through us, so we can definitely help you with that. But I do want to try one last thing before we go down that road. 

Customer: Yeah, okay. What is it?

Agent: Can you check the cable that connects your modem to the wall outlet? The coaxial cable? Just make sure it's screwed in tight on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I can check that. (background noise) Um... (more background noise) Okay, so I'm checking it and it looks pretty tight, but let me try to tighten it a bit more. (sounds of movement) Okay, it's... it's as tight as I can get it. And I'm looking at the modem now and still just red. No change.

Agent: (pause) Alright. And the cable itself doesn't look damaged or anything?

Customer: No, it looks fine. It's been working for like two years, so...

Agent: Right. Okay, David, I think we've done everything we can troubleshoot remotely here. (pause) The modem is not communicating with our network, and I'm not seeing any issues on the infrastructure side. This really does point to a modem hardware failure.

Customer: Okay, so what's the next step? Can you ship me a new modem?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. We can get a replacement modem shipped out to you. It would typically arrive within three to five business days. However, um... (pause) I do want to let you know that we do have technicians available if you'd prefer an in-home visit where they could diagnose the issue and potentially have you up and running faster.

Customer: Three to five days? I mean... I'm working from home. I really need internet before that.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what our next available appointment is. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm looking at our schedule and our earliest available appointment would be... (pause) ...tomorrow morning between eight and twelve. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? Yeah, that could work. That's better than waiting five days anyway.

Agent: Great. Let me get some information and get that scheduled for you. So we'd have a technician come out to your Maple Street address. They'll bring diagnostic equipment and a replacement modem if needed. Is there going to be someone home tomorrow morning between eight and twelve?

Customer: Yeah, I'll make sure I'm there.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to set up that appointment for you. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, David, I have you scheduled for tomorrow morning. The appointment window is eight AM to noon. The technician will have a work order, and they'll check your equipment and get you back online. Do you have a phone number on file that they can call if they're running early or late?

Customer: Um, yeah. The number should be the one you called me on. 555-0147 extension... wait, no, that's my work number. Let me give you my cell. It's 555-0982.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. 555-0982. Let me confirm that—is that area code 503?

Customer: Yes, 503.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap, David, you have an appointment tomorrow morning between eight AM and noon at your Maple Street address. Our technician will diagnose the issue and get your modem working. You should also receive a confirmation email in the next hour or so with all the details.

Customer: Alright. And if the modem is bad, they're just going to replace it, right?

Agent: Yes, they should be able to replace it on-site, and you'll be back online immediately. If for some reason they encounter something different, they'll contact you at that cell number.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. Is there anything else I should try before they come out tomorrow?

Agent: No, I'd recommend you just leave everything as it is. We don't want to introduce any other variables. Just let the technician take care of it tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, sounds good.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today, David?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you for your help.

Agent: You're welcome. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get you back online tomorrow. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
