Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, uh, yeah. Hi Derek. So my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I need to get it fixed because I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that is. Let me pull up your account here and we can get to the bottom of this. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Alright, so I'm seeing your account here. Let me just... okay, so you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Uh, around 8:30, maybe 9? I got up and tried to check my email and nothing was loading. I waited about an hour thinking it might just be a temporary thing, but it's still not working.

Agent: Got it. And just to confirm, we're talking about complete loss of service, right? Like, the modem's not connecting at all?

Customer: Right, yeah. No connection. The modem's still on—like, the lights are lit up and everything—but I can't actually get online.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the power's definitely on. Have you tried restarting the modem yet? Sometimes that can clear things up pretty quickly.

Customer: I... I think I rebooted it once this morning, but let me just do it again to be sure.

Agent: That'd be great. Go ahead and do that for me. Just unplug it from the back, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright... waiting... (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (background noise of device powering up) Should take a minute or so to boot back up, right?

Agent: Exactly. While that's happening, let me ask you a couple more questions. Have there been any storms in your area recently, or any construction work going on nearby?

Customer: No storms that I know of. Uh... actually, there might be some construction down the street? I saw a utility truck a few days ago, but I'm not sure if that's related.

Agent: Hmm, that could potentially be it. Those guys sometimes nick the lines. (pause) Okay, is it back up and running now?

Customer: Um... let me check. (pause) No, still nothing. The lights are on but I'm still not getting connected.

Agent: Alright, no worries. Let me try a different approach here. Can you take a look at the modem for me? I need you to tell me what color the lights are and which ones are lit up.

Customer: Okay, so... I've got the power light, which is green. The internet light is... it's amber, I think? Like, a yellowish color. And the other ones... they're not lit up.

Agent: Alright, so the amber internet light—that's actually telling us something. That typically means the modem is trying to sync but it's not quite getting there. Let me check our system real quick to see if there are any outages in your area.

Customer: Okay. (pause) How long is that gonna take?

Agent: Just a second here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any major outages reported, but that doesn't necessarily mean there isn't something going on. Let me try having you do a factory reset on the modem.

Customer: Oh, uh... will that like, erase my settings or something?

Agent: It will reset the modem back to factory defaults, but don't worry—it should automatically reconfigure once it boots back up. The modem should just reconnect on its own.

Customer: Alright, how do I do that?

Agent: Okay, so on the back of the modem, there should be a small button—it might be recessed. You'll need to hold it down for about 10 to 15 seconds. It's usually labeled "Reset."

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, I found it. (pause) Holding it down now... (pause) Should I hold it til something happens?

Agent: Yeah, you should see the lights flicker and the modem restart. Go ahead and hold it for a good 15 seconds just to make sure.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's restarting. I can see the lights flashing. Let me give it a minute to come back up.

Agent: Sounds good. While we wait, let me just verify a few things on our end. (typing sounds) When was the last time you had any service issues with your account?

Customer: I... I don't think I've had any problems before this. Like, the internet's been fine. This is the first time.

Agent: Okay, that's good. That means this is likely something environmental or possibly a line issue. (pause) Is it back up?

Customer: (pause) Nope. Still amber. Still no connection.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, um... let me try one more thing. Can you tell me—do you have a computer or a phone that you can check right now? I want to see if you can manually connect to the modem's network.

Customer: What do you mean, like connect to the WiFi?

Agent: Yeah, exactly. Can you look for the WiFi network name? It should be either on a sticker on the back of the modem or printed on your paperwork somewhere.

Customer: (pause) Let me grab my phone... okay, yeah. I can see the network. It's showing up but it's just... it's not connecting when I try to join.

Agent: It's not connecting even when you enter the password?

Customer: Well, I'm trying, and it just says "can't connect to this network."

Agent: [inaudible] Okay, that's... that's actually pretty telling. That suggests the modem might not be synced up to our network on the backend. Let me see if there's anything I can do from my end here. (pause) (typing sounds) (pause) Let me send a refresh signal to your modem and see if that helps.

Customer: (pause) Okay. (pause) How long does that take?

Agent: It should happen pretty much immediately, but give it about 30 seconds and then check again.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. Same thing.

Agent: (sigh) Alright. Yeah, I've tried a few things here and unfortunately, I'm not able to get this resolved over the phone. What's likely happening is either there's a line issue between our network and your modem, or there's a physical problem with the modem itself. Either way, we're gonna need to send a technician out to your location to diagnose what's going on.

Customer: Oh, really? How long is that gonna take? When can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) I can get someone out to you tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Does that work?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need this fixed today if possible.

Agent: I completely understand, and I wish I had something available today, but unfortunately all our technicians are booked up at the moment. Tomorrow is the earliest I can schedule. Would that 12 to 4 window work for you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess that's... that's fine. I don't really have a choice, do I?

Agent: I know it's not ideal, and I'm sorry about that. But I want to assure you that once the technician gets there, they'll be able to get this sorted out. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess not. Just... make sure someone shows up tomorrow, okay?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get your contact information confirmed. Can you verify the phone number we have on file is 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And is there a best number for the technician to reach you on tomorrow?

Customer: That same number is fine.

Agent: Great. So I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, December 14th, between 12 and 4 PM. A technician will be out to assess and repair the issue. You'll receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can do for you today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope this gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I do too. I'm sorry we weren't able to resolve it over the phone, but you're in good hands with our technician team. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a good day!
