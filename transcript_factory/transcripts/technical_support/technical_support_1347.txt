Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. One moment... Alright, I've got you here. So your service address is on Maple Street, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying the internet is completely down right now? No connection at all?

Customer: Right, nothing. I tried unplugging the router and the modem, waited like five minutes, plugged it back in. Still nothing. The modem isn't even lighting up like it normally does.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me ask you a few questions. When you look at your modem right now, are there any lights on it at all? Even if they're not the usual colors?

Customer: (pause) Um... let me look. No, it's completely dark. Like, nothing. It's just a black box sitting there.

Agent: Alright, so the modem has no power. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Do you have it plugged into a power outlet directly, or is it plugged into a surge protector?

Customer: It's... it's plugged into a power strip, I think. Yeah, the power strip next to my desk.

Agent: Okay, can you try unplugging the modem from that power strip and plugging it directly into a wall outlet? Let's try that first.

Customer: (background noise) Sure, let me... (pause) Okay, I'm unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, I've got it plugged directly into the wall. Should I wait a minute?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and wait about 30 seconds to a minute and see if any lights come on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, um... I'm still not seeing anything. This is weird. It's still completely dark.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try a different approach. Can you check the power cord itself? Sometimes they can get loose or damaged. Is the cord securely connected to the back of the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks fine to me. It's pretty snug back there.

Agent: Alright. And the other end of the cord is definitely in the wall outlet and the outlet is working?

Customer: Well, let me... (background noise) Yeah, there's a lamp plugged into this outlet and the lamp is on, so... the outlet should be fine.

Agent: Good thinking. That's a good test. So we've got power to the outlet. Let me ask you—did anything happen before the internet went down? A storm? A power outage? Anything like that?

Customer: No, not that I saw. I mean, I was asleep when it happened. I just noticed it when I got up this morning around eight.

Agent: Okay. And has the modem been working fine up until this point? No issues previously?

Customer: Yeah, it's been working perfectly fine for like... I don't know, months? Maybe longer.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Give me just one second here... (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any service issues in your area, which is good news. But I am going to need to escalate this a bit. It sounds like the modem itself might have a hardware failure. Do you have a spare power cable you could try? Like from another device, just to rule that out?

Customer: Uh... (pause) I might have one. Let me look. I've got a bunch of cables in a drawer here somewhere... (background noise, rustling) Um, I don't think any of these will fit. The modem has a pretty specific connector.

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately those modems do have their own specific power supply. Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. The modem appears to be unresponsive, and typically when that happens, we'd need to send a technician out to replace it. But before we do that, let me put you on a brief hold while I check our tech notes and see if there's anything else we can try. Is that okay?

Customer: Yeah, sure, that's fine.

Agent: Alright, hold tight for just a moment. (hold music plays)

(approximately 45 seconds pass)

Agent: Thank you for holding. Okay, so I've reviewed everything and I want to try one more thing. Sometimes the outlet itself can have an issue even if a lamp turns on. Do you have access to another outlet, maybe in a different room? Just to be thorough?

Customer: Yeah, I can try that. (background noise) Hold on... (pause) Okay, I'm in the kitchen now and I've plugged the modem into an outlet here... (pause) Nope. Still nothing. Still dark.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I appreciate you trying that. At this point, it really does seem like the modem has failed. Here's what I can do for you. I can schedule a technician to come out and replace your modem. We typically have availability within the next 24 to 48 hours depending on your area. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I guess. I mean, I need this working as soon as possible. Today would be ideal, but I understand if that's not possible.

Agent: Let me check what we have available today. (typing sounds) (pause) Unfortunately, I'm not seeing any same-day appointments available, but I can get you in tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work?

Customer: (sighs) I mean, it's not ideal, but I guess it'll have to do. Yeah, tomorrow morning works.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I have you down for tomorrow, between 8 and noon. The technician will bring a replacement modem and get you all set up. There won't be any charge for the replacement or the service call since this is a hardware failure on our end. Is there a best number to reach you at if the technician needs to contact you?

Customer: Um, you can use the number on file, I think. The 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you'll be home tomorrow morning?

Customer: Yeah, I'll make sure I'm here.

Agent: Excellent. I'm going to email you a confirmation with all the details, and the technician should arrive sometime in that window. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate your help, even though we couldn't fix it right now.

Agent: I totally understand, and I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online today. We'll get this taken care of tomorrow. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye!
