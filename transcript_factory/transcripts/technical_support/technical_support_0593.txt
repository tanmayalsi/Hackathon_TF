Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, uh, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the address on file at 2341 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have there been any recent storms in your area or any power issues?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The power's fine. Lights are on, everything else is working. It's just the internet that's down.

Agent: Got it. Okay, so just to get a baseline here—is the modem powered on right now? Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Um, let me look... Yeah, I see the power light is on, but most of the other lights are... well, they're not on. Like, I don't see the internet light or whatever you call it.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So the power light is on but the other indicator lights aren't lit up. Can you tell me which lights you do see? Are there any blinking?

Customer: Just the power one. That's it. There's like, normally there's usually a light that shows the internet is connected and that's not there.

Agent: Right, so you're not seeing the online indicator light, which would typically be green. That suggests the modem isn't connecting to the network. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me and wait about thirty seconds?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, sure. (background noise of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about thirty seconds. I'll wait with you.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (background noise) Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about two to three minutes to boot back up. While we wait, let me ask—do you have a separate router, or is everything built into the modem?

Customer: I have a router, yeah. It's a separate box.

Agent: Okay, and is that powered on as well?

Customer: Yes, it is. I can see lights on that one too.

Agent: Good. And are those lights... are they steady or blinking?

Customer: Um, they're like, some of them are blinking. One's steady. I'm not really sure what that means.

Agent: That's alright. Okay, I'm looking at your account right now and I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, so that's good news. Let me check with you—do you see the online light on the modem now?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. Just that power light.

Agent: Hmm, alright. Let's try another approach. Can you check the cable connections for me? Make sure the coaxial cable—that's the thick cable with the metal fittings—is securely connected to the back of the modem.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. It looks pretty tight. I can try jiggling it a bit though.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and try that. Sometimes they can work themselves loose.

Customer: (background noise, sounds of movement) Okay, I jiggled it around. Still not seeing anything change on the lights.

Agent: Alright. Let me try to restart the modem from our end. This should take just a moment. (typing sounds) Okay, I've sent a restart command. Give it about ninety seconds to cycle back up.

Customer: Okay. (pause) So, um, how long have you worked there?

Agent: (chuckles) Oh, about three years now. How long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Maybe two years? Honestly, I haven't had too many issues until now.

Agent: That's great to hear. Hopefully we can get you back up and running quickly. Let me check on that modem—are you seeing any changes with the lights?

Customer: Nope. Still just the power light. This is really weird. I don't know what's going on.

Agent: I understand. Let me ask you a couple more questions. Have you recently changed anything with your setup? New router, moved the modem, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. Everything's been the same for months.

Agent: Okay. And you're sure the coaxial cable connection is tight?

Customer: Yeah, I mean... I think so. Let me try unscrewing it and plugging it back in more carefully.

Customer: (background noise of disconnecting and reconnecting) Okay, it's back in. Really tight this time.

Agent: Excellent. Now unplug the modem again for me, and this time unplug the router as well.

Customer: (pause) Okay, both are unplugged.

Agent: Good. Let's wait about forty-five seconds this time, and then plug the modem back in first. Wait for about two minutes, and then plug the router back in.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, modem's back in. I'm counting to two minutes... (pause) Okay, router's back in now.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's see what happens. Give it a minute to fully boot.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) I'm not seeing the online light yet.

Agent: [inaudible] ...let me just double-check something on the account here. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I'm not showing any issues on our end. The service is definitely active on the account.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it the modem?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be the modem itself, or it could be an issue with the connection between here and your house. Do you have a smartphone or tablet you can try connecting to the router's WiFi?

Customer: Yeah, I have my phone. Let me try that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, uh... I'm not seeing the WiFi network at all. Like, there's nothing to connect to.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That tells me the router isn't getting a signal from the modem. That's... that's a pretty good indicator the issue is between the modem and our network. Let me try one more thing. Can you check if there's a reset button on the modem? Usually it's a small button you have to press for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's like, recessed in. Do I... do I need something to press it?

Agent: A pen or a paperclip would work perfectly.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (background noise) Alright, I'm pressing it. How long do I hold it?

Agent: About ten seconds should do it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm at ten. (background noise of releasing) Now what?

Agent: Now let's wait for the modem to fully restart. This can take a few minutes. It'll cycle through its startup sequence again.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, it's been a few minutes. Still just the power light though.

Agent: Okay, I'm not going to lie to you—at this point, it's looking like we might have a hardware issue with the modem itself, or possibly a line issue on our end that I can't diagnose over the phone. I want to get you taken care of here. Do you have any warranty on the equipment?

Customer: I'm not sure, to be honest.

Agent: Okay, let me check that for you. (typing sounds, pause) You do have our equipment protection plan on your account, so that's good news. That means we can get you a replacement modem sent out, or we can schedule a technician visit to check the line.

Customer: How long would that take? The replacement modem, I mean.

Agent: Usually three to five business days, but if you'd prefer, I can schedule a technician to come out and diagnose the issue. They could potentially get you back online today or tomorrow depending on availability.

Customer: Yeah, I think I'd rather have someone come out. I need my internet. I work from home.

Agent: Absolutely, I understand. Let me get a technician scheduled for you. What does your availability look like? We have some openings tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have afternoon slots as well.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works. 8 to 12 is fine.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. The technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive. Is the number on file 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell phone number, so that works.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, the service address is 2341 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Excellent. Alright, so just to recap—you have a service technician appointment tomorrow morning, 8 AM to noon window. They'll diagnose the issue, and they should be able to get you back online or discuss replacement options if needed. In the meantime, keep the modem unplugged so we don't put any extra stress on it. Does that all sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. And I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Hopefully we'll have you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. I appreciate it.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. We'll see you tomorrow!

Customer: Okay, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
