Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out completely and I've been without it for like the past hour or so. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Riverside area. Just to confirm, the internet isn't working at all right now, correct?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. I tried unplugging the modem and the router, waited a few minutes, plugged them back in... still nothing.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on that. That's actually the first thing we would've had you do. Um, let me check here... (pause) I am seeing that we don't have any service alerts in your area right now, so it looks like it's isolated to your account. Can you tell me what you're seeing on your equipment? When you look at your modem, what color are the lights?

Customer: The lights? Um... (pause) Okay, so the power light is on, it's green. But like, the internet light—I think it's the one that should indicate internet connection—it's red. Or maybe orange? It's definitely not green.

Agent: Alright, red or orange on the internet indicator light. That typically means the modem isn't syncing with our network. Have you had any recent storms in your area, or any changes to your setup?

Customer: No storms that I know of. Nothing's changed. I mean, it was working fine this morning when I left for work and when I got home it was just... dead.

Agent: Okay. Let me try a couple of things here. First, can you unplug the modem one more time? But this time, I want you to leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds, okay?

Customer: Okay, yeah. (pause, background noise of unplugging) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just... let it sit there for a moment. I'm going to check something on my end real quick. (typing sounds) Okay, go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's back on.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about a minute to boot back up. While we're waiting, um... do you have your router connected to the modem with an ethernet cable, or are you using the WiFi?

Customer: Both, actually. I've got my computer hardwired to the router and my phone is on the WiFi.

Agent: Okay, that's good. (pause) Alright, so what are you seeing on the modem lights now?

Customer: (pause) Still the same. Power's green, but that internet light is still... it's like an orange-red color.

Agent: Alright, let me try something else. Can you unplug the router as well? And then wait about thirty seconds before plugging that back in too.

Customer: The router? Okay... (pause, background noise) Yeah, it's unplugged now. (pause) Thirty seconds... (longer pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: And just so I have all the details, what model router do you have? Is it one we provided or...?

Customer: It's one you guys gave me, I think. It's... uh... (pause) I'm not even sure. It's a white box. There's probably a sticker somewhere but I'm not gonna crawl behind there to find it right now.

Agent: (chuckles) No, I understand. That's fine. So the router should be back online now. What are we seeing?

Customer: The router's lights are on, they look normal... but I'm still not getting internet on my computer. Let me check my phone. (pause) No WiFi from the router either.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds, longer pause) Um, so I'm not seeing the modem successfully connecting to our network at this point. That orange light you mentioned is what we call a "loss of signal" indicator. Are you able to see the ONT at all? That's the small box that should be mounted on the outside of your house or maybe in a closet—it's usually white or black.

Customer: ONT? I... I'm not really sure what that is, to be honest.

Agent: That's okay. It's basically the device that converts the fiber signal into something your modem can use. Do you remember anything being installed when we set up your service?

Customer: Yeah, I remember someone coming out like... I dunno, six months ago? But I don't know where anything is. Can't you just... I dunno, fix it from your end or something?

Agent: Let me check what I can do on my end. (typing sounds, pause) I'm not seeing any way to remotely reset this or trigger a reconnection. The issue is that your modem isn't even reaching our network, which means the problem is likely between our network and your equipment.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it the modem?

Agent: It could be the modem, but it's more likely a connection issue between the modem and the ONT I mentioned, or possibly the ONT itself. I think what we really need to do here is... (pause) Have you had any power outages recently? Like, even a brief one?

Customer: Not that I noticed, but... I mean, my power's been on the whole time.

Agent: Right. Okay, um... (typing sounds) I'm going to try one more thing. I'm going to send a signal refresh out to your account. Give me just a moment here. (pause) Alright, I've sent that through. Can you unplug the modem one more time and wait about a minute before plugging it back in?

Customer: We're doing this again? (sighs) Okay, I mean... yeah, sure. (pause, background noise) It's unplugged. (longer pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: And just give it... give it a solid two minutes this time to fully boot up and try to sync. I know this is tedious, I apologize.

Customer: (pause) It's fine, I guess. I'm just... I really need this working. I have a presentation I need to prep for tonight.

Agent: I totally understand. That's the last thing you need. Okay, so it's been about two minutes now. What are we seeing on the modem?

Customer: (pause) Same thing. That orange light is still there.

Agent: (pause) Alright. So I've tried everything I can remotely, and unfortunately we're not getting a connection on my end either. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to your location to check the ONT and the physical connection from the network to your house.

Customer: A technician? How long is that gonna take? When could someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so... we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we also have a 2 to 6 PM window. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Like... that's the soonest? I can't get it today?

Agent: I wish I had something available today for you. Unfortunately, our technicians are fully booked for the rest of the day. I know tomorrow isn't ideal, but I do want to get you back online as quickly as possible.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Yeah, okay. I mean, I guess I don't have much choice. Let me go with the morning window, 8 to 12.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to schedule a technician visit for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. Let me confirm your address. I'm showing 447 Maple Drive, Riverside?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And the technician will need access to the exterior of your house where the ONT is located. Are you going to be home?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. So you're all set for tomorrow morning. You should receive a confirmation text and email with all the details. Is there anything else I can help you with tonight?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I mean... I'm not happy about waiting until tomorrow, but there's not much I can do about it, right?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I really do apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. Hopefully the technician will be able to identify the issue and get you back online quickly. Is there anything I can note on your account that would be helpful for the technician?

Customer: Just... let them know I've already rebooted everything. The modem power light is green but the internet indicator is orange, and the router won't connect. I don't know, whatever you need.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm going to add all of that to your account notes so when the technician arrives, they'll have the full history of what we've troubleshot. They'll appreciate that.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: Thank you so much for being patient with me tonight, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't get this fixed immediately. Is there a phone number where the technician can reach you if there are any issues tomorrow?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the same number on the account.

Agent: Perfect. We have that already. You're all set. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I do apologize again for the inconvenience. We'll get you taken care of tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, alright. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good night.

Customer: You too.
