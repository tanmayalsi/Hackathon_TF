Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried restarting the router and nothing's working.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get a first and last name please?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Thank you, David. Okay, I'm looking at your account here. So you mentioned the internet just went out about an hour ago. Before it went out, were you experiencing any issues? Like slow speeds or anything like that?

Customer: No, it was working fine. I was just... I was in the middle of a Zoom call, actually, and it just dropped. Like, completely lost connection.

Agent: Oh man, that's never fun. Okay, so let me ask you a few questions here. Are you seeing any lights on your modem right now? Can you check that for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, um, so the power light is on, but... the internet light is off. It's just not lit up.

Agent: Okay, that's actually helpful information. So the power is on but we're not getting a signal. Have you tried unplugging the modem yet? Sometimes that helps reset the connection.

Customer: No, not yet. I just tried the restart button on the back, but that didn't work. You want me to unplug it?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and do that. Just unplug it from the power outlet, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. While you're doing that, I can stay on the line.

Customer: Okay, give me one second. (rustling sounds) Alright, it's unplugged. I'm gonna count to thirty... (background noise, customer counting quietly) Okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Let me know when you see the lights starting to come back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the power light is back on... the internet light is... still nothing. It's not lighting up.

Agent: Hmm, alright. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me what kind of modem you have? It should say on the front or back of the device.

Customer: It's a... it looks like an Arris SB8200.

Agent: Okay, perfect. That's a good modem. So we're not seeing a signal coming from our equipment either. Let me ask you this—do you have a separate router, or is it all in one unit?

Customer: I have a separate WiFi router that's connected to the modem.

Agent: Okay, so here's what I want you to do. Can you also do a hard reset on the router? Just unplug that one too, wait about thirty seconds, and plug it back in.

Customer: Sure, yeah. (pause) Alright, unplugging the router now. (rustling) Okay, waiting... (pause) Plugging it back in.

Agent: Good. And we're still not seeing any internet light on the modem?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. The modem power is on, but that internet light is just... dark.

Agent: Alright, David, let me check if there's an outage in your area. Can you give me your service address real quick?

Customer: Yeah, it's 2847 Maple Street, apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, checking now... (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area. That's actually... hmm, that's odd. Okay, so let me walk through a few more things here. Can you check the cable going into the modem? The coaxial cable? Is it connected tightly?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks... it looks pretty tight to me. I mean, it's connected. Should I try jiggling it or something?

Agent: Actually, you know what, that might help. Just give it a gentle wiggle to make sure it's seated properly.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, I'm... I'm jiggling it a bit. (pause) Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, um, let me try something else. Can you check your power outlet? Like, try plugging something else into it? Your phone charger or something? Just to make sure you're getting power to that outlet.

Customer: Good idea. (pause) Yeah, my phone charger is working fine, so the outlet's good.

Agent: Okay, that rules that out at least. (pause) You know what, David, this is starting to sound like a potential issue with the modem itself or possibly a line problem on our side. Have you had any recent storms or anything like that in your area?

Customer: Actually, now that you mention it, there was pretty heavy rain and wind last night. Could that have done something?

Agent: It's definitely possible. Weather can sometimes affect the line. Let me... let me run a test from our end here. (typing sounds) (longer pause) Okay, so I'm getting some signal degradation on your line, but I'm still not seeing a complete loss. This could indicate a line issue or a bad connection somewhere.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it like a problem with the cable outside or something?

Agent: It could be. It could also be the modem itself not responding properly. Unfortunately, I'm not able to pinpoint the exact issue from here. I think what we need to do is get a technician out to your location to do a physical inspection.

Customer: (sighs) How long would that take? I really need my internet back.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) Okay, so I can get someone out to you tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or I have another slot on Thursday afternoon between 1 PM and 5 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better for me.

Agent: Perfect. So I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, between 8 AM and 12 PM. (typing sounds) The technician's number will be 555-0198. They'll call you about thirty minutes before they arrive. And just to confirm, that's 2847 Maple Street, apartment 3B, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today? And I apologize that we weren't able to get this resolved over the phone.

Customer: No, that's... that's okay. I mean, I wish we could've figured it out, but at least you're getting someone out. Thank you for trying.

Agent: Of course. You should be back up and running soon. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, David, thanks for being patient with me today. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the appointment details. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Take care.
