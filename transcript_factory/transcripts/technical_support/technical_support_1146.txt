Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I've tried restarting the router and everything, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll see what we can figure out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm seeing your account here under Michael Torres, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned you've restarted the router already. Just to confirm, when you say the internet is down, do you have any lights on the modem or router at all?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually. The power light is on, but the internet light... I think it's the blue one? That's not on. It's just dark.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on but you're not seeing the internet connection light. That's helpful information. And you're in the... (typing) ...Tucson area, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Alright. Let me check if there are any outages in your area. (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end, so that's good news. It means it's likely something we can troubleshoot together. When you restarted the router, how did you do that?

Customer: I just unplugged it for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in.

Agent: Good, that's the right way to do it. And how long ago was that?

Customer: Maybe... five minutes? Ten minutes ago?

Agent: Okay. Let me have you do that one more time, but this time let's leave it unplugged for about two minutes. That'll give it a full reset. Can you do that now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, sure. (background noise of unplugging) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Let's just give it a minute and a half or so. While we're waiting, can you tell me... did anything happen right before the internet stopped working? Any storms, power outages, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine when I went to bed last night, and then this morning it just... wasn't.

Agent: Got it. And you haven't made any changes to the router or the modem?

Customer: No, nothing.

Agent: (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, plugged back in. (pause) Now I'm waiting for the lights to come on.

Agent: Yeah, it should take about thirty seconds to a minute for it to fully boot up. What we're looking for is that blue internet light to come back on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... the power light came back on. The other lights are starting to flash, but... no, the blue one is still not on.

Agent: Hmm, okay. So we have the power light on, but the internet light is still not coming up. Let me ask you a couple more questions. Can you check the cable that's going into the back of the modem? The one that comes from the wall?

Customer: The one from the wall? (pause) Yeah, I can see it. It looks like it's... I don't know, plugged in fine?

Agent: Can you unplug it and plug it back in? Just make sure it's firmly connected.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm unplugging it... alright, back in. (pause) Still no internet light though.

Agent: Alright. And that cable is the only thing going into that port, right? You're not running any splitters or anything?

Customer: No, it's just that one cable.

Agent: Okay, let me check something here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at our system and... I'm not showing a connection from your modem to our network. That tells me there might be an issue on our end with your line, or... (pause) Let me see your service history here.

Customer: Is it a big problem?

Agent: I mean, it could be a few things. It might just be that the modem needs to be replaced, or there could be an issue with the line coming into your house. Have you noticed any equipment outside that looks damaged or anything?

Customer: I... I'm not really sure where to look for that, honestly.

Agent: No, that's fair. Um, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm going to have you try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? This will erase all the settings, so it'll need to set itself up again.

Customer: Uh... how do I do that?

Agent: There should be a small button on the back of the modem. You're going to need something like a paperclip to press it. Hold it down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (background noise, rustling) Okay, I'm looking at the back. I see a bunch of ports but I don't see a... wait, I think I see it. It's really small, right?

Agent: Yes, exactly. There should be a button labeled "Reset" near all the ports.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I found it. (background noise) Okay, I'm pressing it now with a paperclip.

Agent: Good, just hold it for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's resetting. I can see some of the lights going crazy now. (pause) Alright, it's... it looks like it's booting back up.

Agent: Perfect. Again, we're looking for that blue internet light to come on.

Customer: (long pause) Um... yeah, so the power light is on. Some of the other indicator lights are on now, but that internet light... still nothing. It's still dark.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I hate to say it, but this is pointing more toward either a modem issue or a problem on the line side. Let me put you on a quick hold here while I check a few things on my end. Is that alright?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays for about 30 seconds) Alright, thank you for holding. So I've had a chance to look at some things here, and I'm not seeing any connectivity to your location at all. That suggests we might have a service issue with your line. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: The issue is, I'm not able to troubleshoot that remotely. We would need to send a technician out to investigate. They can check the line coming into your house, test the modem, all of that. Unfortunately, I'm not able to fix it from here.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what our availability looks like. (typing) I'm showing we can get someone out to you tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't you do today?

Agent: Let me check... (typing) (pause) Unfortunately, today is pretty booked up. Tomorrow morning is the earliest I'm seeing.

Customer: (frustrated) Man, I really needed this today. I have work to do.

Agent: I totally get that, and I'm sorry. I know that's frustrating. If you can make it work, the technician tomorrow morning will get to the bottom of this and get you back online. In the meantime, is there anything else I can try right now?

Customer: I don't know... I mean, you've tried everything, right?

Agent: I think we've exhausted the troubleshooting steps I can do remotely. The reset, the power cycle... those are the main things. At this point, it really does seem like a line issue or a modem replacement, and the tech can handle both of those.

Customer: (sigh) Alright, yeah. Let's just set up the appointment for tomorrow.

Agent: Okay, perfect. Let me get some information from you. What's the best number to reach you at?

Customer: 555-0147, same as my account number.

Agent: Perfect, I have that. And is that a cell phone or a landline?

Customer: It's my cell phone.

Agent: Great. So I have you down for tomorrow, between 8 and 12 PM. The technician will text you about thirty minutes before they arrive. If something comes up and you need to reschedule, just give us a call back at the number on your bill.

Customer: Okay. And you think the tech will be able to fix this?

Agent: Yeah, I'm pretty confident. If it's the modem, they'll replace it. If it's the line, they'll repair it. One way or another, they'll get you back online tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, well, I hope so. This is pretty frustrating.

Agent: I understand, and again, I'm sorry you're dealing with this. We really appreciate your patience today, Michael. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for calling Frontier. We'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
