Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um... my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back on. I've tried unplugging everything but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I see your account here. So you mentioned the internet went out about an hour ago. Have there been any storms in your area, or did anything else happen before it stopped working?

Customer: No storms or anything. I was just... I was streaming a show and it just cut out. The TV went black and then I tried to check my email on my phone using WiFi and nothing.

Agent: Okay, so you're not getting any internet at all right now. Let me ask you this—do you see any lights on your modem or router? Are they powered on?

Customer: Um, yeah. The modem's got some lights on it. I see like a blue one and a green one, I think. The router's got lights too.

Agent: Good, that's a start. So the devices are powered on. Are any of those lights red or blinking in a way that seems unusual?

Customer: (pause) The blue light on the modem is blinking. Is that bad?

Agent: The blue blinking light usually means it's trying to connect. That's actually normal. Can you describe the green light for me? Is it steady or blinking?

Customer: It's blinking too. Both of them are blinking, actually.

Agent: Okay, so both lights are blinking. And your router—can you tell me what you're seeing there?

Customer: Um... the power light's on, solid. But I don't see any internet light on it. There's one that's like... amber colored? And it's blinking.

Agent: Alright, so the amber light on your router is blinking. That typically indicates a connection issue between the modem and router. Let me have you try a couple of things. First, can you unplug the modem—that's the device that comes directly from the wall—and leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds?

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While that's unplugged, go ahead and unplug the router as well.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Both unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about thirty seconds for everything to discharge. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first, and we'll give that about a minute to boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's back on.

Agent: Good. Do you see those lights coming back on?

Customer: Yeah, the lights are... they're lighting up. Still blinking though.

Agent: That's normal. The modem needs a minute to fully boot up and connect to our network. While we're waiting, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your account... it looks like we're showing an active service here on our end. Let me check if there are any outages in your area. (pause) No active outages that I'm seeing in your neighborhood.

Customer: Hmm, that's weird.

Agent: Okay, so give it another ten seconds or so, and then tell me what you're seeing with those lights.

Customer: (pause) The blue light... okay, the blue light stopped blinking. It's just solid now. But the green light is still blinking pretty quickly.

Agent: (pause) The green light is still blinking pretty quickly. Okay. Now go ahead and plug your router back in.

Customer: Alright. (pause) Router's back in.

Agent: And give that about thirty to forty seconds to power back up completely.

Customer: (pause) Okay, the lights are coming on. I'm seeing power, and I'm seeing... is it okay if I try to connect to the WiFi on my phone?

Agent: Actually, let's just wait one more moment. Let me know once the lights on the router stabilize a bit.

Customer: (pause) Um... the power light's solid. The other lights are still blinking, but they seem to be blinking slower now, I think?

Agent: (pause) Is the internet light on the router solid or is it still blinking?

Customer: (pause) I... I don't really see an internet light on this router. There's like five lights up here. The power one's solid. Two of them are blinking, and two of them aren't on at all.

Agent: Okay, I think I see the issue. Can you tell me the model of your router? It should be on a sticker on the back or bottom.

Customer: (pause) It says... uh... "Frontier" on it, and there's a model number. It says FTR-2847. Does that matter?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, that does help. Okay, so I'm looking at the specs for that model. One of those lights that's not on—that should be your internet status light. And that's what we want to see.

Customer: So that's bad, right? If it's not on?

Agent: That does indicate that there's not a connection between your modem and router. We've restarted both devices, which is good. Let me try something else. Can you check the cable connecting your modem to your router? Is it plugged in firmly on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... I'm looking at it now. It looks plugged in to me. Both ends seem tight.

Agent: Can you unplug that cable anyway and plug it back in? Sometimes these connections get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it. (pause) And plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Good. And now let's give it about thirty seconds and see if that internet light comes on.

Customer: (pause) (pause) Still nothing. The other lights are still blinking.

Agent: (pause) David, I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I escalate this to our technical support team. This seems like it might be a connection issue that requires a bit more in-depth troubleshooting. Is that okay?

Customer: Um, sure. How long will that be?

Agent: It should only be just a minute or two. Thank you for your patience.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Okay David, I'm back. I've spoken with our technical team, and they're seeing something odd on their end with your connection. They're thinking this might be a modem issue or possibly something with the line coming into your home. I have a few more things we can try, but these are a bit more technical. Do you want to keep going, or would you prefer to schedule a technician to come out?

Customer: Well, let's try what you've got. I don't really want to wait for a technician if we can fix this now.

Agent: Absolutely. Okay, so I need you to access your modem's settings page. Do you have a computer or laptop handy?

Customer: Yeah, I've got a laptop, but... I'm not connected to anything. Can I still access it?

Agent: You can access it through a wired connection. Do you have an ethernet cable?

Customer: Um, I might have one. Let me... (pause) (pause) I don't really know where my ethernet cable is. I haven't used one in like... years.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's alright. Without being able to access the modem's settings page and without an ethernet connection, I'm a bit limited here. We've already done the standard restart troubleshooting, and the lights are indicating that the connection between your modem and router isn't establishing properly. 

Customer: So we can't fix this?

Agent: Unfortunately, based on what we're seeing, this is likely a hardware issue with either your modem or the connection to the line coming into your home. I really think at this point, we're going to need to send a technician out to diagnose the issue properly and potentially replace your modem.

Customer: How long until they can come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. We have an opening tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we could potentially get someone out the day after tomorrow in the morning.

Customer: Tomorrow works, I guess. I'm not happy about this, but...

Agent: I completely understand, David. Let me get that scheduled for you.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: Perfect. So you're all set for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM. You'll receive a confirmation email at the address on your account, and a technician will reach out about thirty minutes before they arrive. They'll be able to diagnose the issue and get you back online.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: I apologize we couldn't resolve this over the phone today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's... that's it.

Agent: Well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, David. We'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye.
