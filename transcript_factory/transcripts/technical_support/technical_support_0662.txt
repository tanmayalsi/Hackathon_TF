Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, James. Got you here. So your internet's been down since this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, I'd say around 8 or 9 AM. I was working from home and it just... it just stopped working. The router's still on, the lights are blinking and everything, but I can't connect to anything.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Have you tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in yet?

Customer: (pause) Actually, no, I haven't. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and do that. Just unplug it from the power, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: (background noise of unplugging) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, waiting... (pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it a minute or two to boot back up. While that's happening, can you check if there's an optical network terminal, or ONT, near your modem? It might be a small box, usually white or black?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I see it. It's right next to the router. It's got some lights on it.

Agent: Perfect. Now, are all the lights on that ONT green, or are you seeing any red or orange lights?

Customer: (pause) Um, let me look closer. There's... there's a red light. On one of them. I think it says... it looks like it says "LOS" or something?

Agent: Okay, that's actually a good clue. That means "Loss of Signal." So the issue might not be with your equipment at home—it could be coming from outside. Do you see any visible damage to the fiber line coming into your house? Maybe something that got knocked loose or anything?

Customer: No, not that I can see. I mean, I'm looking out the window, and I don't see anything obviously broken or anything.

Agent: Alright. Let's try one more thing. I'm going to have you power cycle the ONT. So unplug that box for about 30 seconds and plug it back in. Be careful with the fiber cable though—don't pull on it.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, unplugging it. (pause) This is frustrating. I really need to get this working. I've got a meeting at noon.

Agent: I totally understand. Hopefully we'll get you back up and running shortly. Go ahead and plug it back in when you're ready.

Customer: (background noise of plugging in) Okay, it's back in. I can see the lights coming back on. The power light's on... (pause) But the red light... the red light is still there.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm, okay. And it's still just that one light that's red?

Customer: Yeah, just the one.

Agent: Alright, I'm checking your line here. (pause) I'm not showing any outages in your area, and your account looks active on our end. Let me check when we last had a successful connection from your home. (pause) It looks like it dropped around 8:47 AM, so that lines up with what you said. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it from there?

Agent: Well, the LOS signal usually means there's a break in the fiber connection somewhere between our network and your home. It could be a line issue, a damaged fiber cable, or even a problem at the junction point outside. Unfortunately, that's not something I can resolve remotely. What I can do is schedule a technician to come out and take a look at it.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. What's your address again?

Customer: It's 447 Maple Drive.

Agent: (typing sounds) And what time works best for you? We have... looks like we have some availability this afternoon between 1 and 4 PM, or we could do tomorrow morning between 8 and 11 AM.

Customer: This afternoon? That might work. Do I have to stay home the whole time?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. We need someone at the residence to let the technician in. They'll need access to the outside and inside of your home to diagnose the issue.

Customer: Okay, this afternoon works. But listen, before we set that up, is there anything else we can try? I really need my internet working for this meeting at noon.

Agent: (pause) Let me see... Have you tried connecting to your router with an ethernet cable instead of Wi-Fi? Sometimes that can help isolate whether it's a Wi-Fi issue or a broader connection issue.

Customer: I... don't have an ethernet cable. Is that going to matter?

Agent: Well, if the issue is on the fiber line itself, which I'm pretty confident it is based on that LOS signal, then it wouldn't matter. But let me ask you this—do you have a cell phone with a hotspot feature?

Customer: Yeah, I do, but I'd rather not use my phone data. My plan doesn't have a lot of it.

Agent: I understand. Unfortunately, without the ability to see an ethernet connection working, and with that persistent LOS signal, I'm fairly confident the issue is on the line outside your home. I think your best bet is really to get a technician out here to assess it physically.

Customer: (frustrated) Okay, okay. So this afternoon then. Between 1 and 4?

Agent: Yes, between 1 and 4 PM. I'll get that scheduled for you. Can I get a callback number to confirm the appointment?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I have your appointment scheduled for this afternoon, 1 to 4 PM, at 447 Maple Drive. Your confirmation number is 8734-FRN. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: (long pause) No. I guess I'll just... I'll wait and see what happens this afternoon.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone, James. But our technician should be able to pinpoint the problem and get you reconnected. In the meantime, if you need to contact us again, you can reference that confirmation number. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.
