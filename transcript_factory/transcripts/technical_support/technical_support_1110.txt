Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, so my internet just... it's completely down. I've had Frontier for like two years and this has never happened before.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick so we can get this sorted out for you. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that now. So your internet is completely down right now—is that correct? No connectivity at all?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. I tried resetting the modem and the router, you know, the typical stuff. Unplugged them both, waited like five minutes, plugged them back in. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's good that you already tried that. You're ahead of the game. Um... let me check something here. (pause) Alright, so I'm seeing that your account is active and everything looks good on our end. Do you have the modem powered on right now?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. I can see the lights on it, but like... they're not doing what they normally do. Usually there's this solid green light, you know? Right now it's like blinking red.

Agent: Okay, a blinking red light—that typically indicates either a connection issue or it could mean the modem isn't communicating with our network. Let me ask you a few questions. Are all the cables connected properly? The one coming into your wall and then into the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I checked that too. Everything's plugged in. The coaxial cable, the power cable, all of it.

Agent: Good. And just to clarify, you mentioned you unplugged everything—did you unplug the modem first and then the router, or...?

Customer: I did the modem first, yeah. Then the router. Let them sit for like five, maybe six minutes, and then plugged them back in in the same order.

Agent: Perfect, that's exactly what you should do. (typing sounds) Okay, so let me try something here. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem from our end. This might take a minute or two. Just keep it powered on and plugged in, okay?

Customer: Alright, I'm looking at it right now.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I've sent that. What we're looking for is... the lights should cycle through a few different colors and then settle back to that solid green. Is anything changing on your end?

Customer: Um... no, it's still the same. Still blinking red.

Agent: (pause) Hm. Okay, let me try a different approach. The blinking red light could also mean there's an issue with the signal coming into your house. Have you noticed any recent storms or anything like that in your area?

Customer: No, it's been clear all day. Beautiful actually.

Agent: Alright. And you haven't had any other power outages or anything unusual happen before this started, right?

Customer: No, not that I'm aware of. I was just using it this morning, everything was fine, and then this afternoon I came home and tried to connect and it just wasn't there.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm making a note of that. Let me check something... (pause) I'm looking at our network status in your area and everything appears to be up and running normally. We're not showing any outages.

Customer: So it's not a problem on your end?

Agent: Well, it could still be something on our network, but not a widespread outage. It might be something specific to your connection. Um, let me have you try one more thing for me. Can you unplug the modem again?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause, background rustling) It's unplugged.

Agent: Okay, and I want you to leave it unplugged for about two minutes this time. A little bit longer than before.

Customer: Alright, I'm just... I'm just gonna wait. (pause) So how long have you worked there, Derek?

Agent: Oh, about four years now. (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause, plugging sounds) Okay, it's back in. Let me see... (pause) Same thing. Red blinking light.

Agent: (sigh) Alright. Okay, let me try sending another signal. Just give me one second. (typing sounds, longer pause) And... sent. Let me know if anything changes.

Customer: (waiting) Nope. Still blinking red. This is... this is really frustrating. I work from home, man. I need this internet.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. Let me see what else I can check here... (typing sounds) Okay, so the fact that the reset signal isn't changing anything on your end... that might indicate that we're having difficulty communicating with your modem. It could be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or it could be a problem with the line coming to your house.

Customer: So what does that mean? What do I do?

Agent: Well, typically we would have a technician go out and check both the modem and the line to diagnose what's happening. However, before we schedule that, let me just try one more thing. I want to check your modem model real quick. Can you look at the label on the front or the back of your modem and tell me what model it is?

Customer: (pause) Um, it's... MB7738.

Agent: Okay, MB7738. And, uh... (typing sounds) how old would you say that modem is?

Customer: I don't know, maybe two and a half years? It came with the service when we set it up.

Agent: Okay, that's actually still pretty new. It shouldn't be failing at this point. (pause) Alright, let me try... one more time here. I'm going to reboot it from our system. This one might take a little longer. Just watch and let me know if you see any changes at all—whether it's the lights changing, anything.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I'm watching it. (long pause) Still just red. Still just blinking red.

Agent: (exhales slowly) Okay. Um... [inaudible] sorry, one moment. Let me check something here. (pause) Okay, so the system is not showing that the modem has rebooted on our end. Which means... it's not communicating with our network, which confirms what I suspected.

Customer: So it's definitely broken?

Agent: It could be. Or it could be the connection coming from outside your house. It's hard to say without a technician actually looking at it in person. I'm not going to keep you on the phone spinning our wheels here. I think the best thing to do is to get someone out there to take a look.

Customer: How long would that take? When can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me pull up our scheduling. What days work best for you?

Customer: Um, I mean... ideally tomorrow? I really need this fixed ASAP.

Agent: I totally understand. (pause, typing) Okay, so looking at our schedule for tomorrow, I have an opening between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works. That's fine.

Agent: Great. I'm going to get you scheduled for that. You'll receive a confirmation text and email, and a technician will be out to your address between those hours. Their job will be to check the modem and the line connection and figure out what's causing the issue.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Should I keep the modem unplugged or...?

Agent: No, actually, go ahead and leave it plugged in. The technician will want to see it in its current state when they arrive. And um, just to confirm, the address we have on file is 4521 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, so a technician will be there tomorrow between 8 and noon. Is there a phone number they can reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, same number you called me on, or... well, the number I called you on.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. Okay, so I have everything set up for you. Your ticket number is 7849302. I'd recommend keeping that in case you need to reference it. You should get a text within the next few minutes.

Customer: Alright. Um... is there anything else I can try tonight? Like, just in case?

Agent: Honestly, at this point, I don't think there's much more we can do over the phone. The issue seems to be with the hardware or the line itself, which I can't diagnose or fix remotely. If you want, you could try restarting your computer or any other devices, but I don't think that will resolve it.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Well, I guess I'll just wait for the technician tomorrow then.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it working tonight. I know this is a huge inconvenience. But our tech team is really good, and they should be able to identify and fix the issue pretty quickly once they're there.

Customer: Yeah, alright. Thanks for trying, Derek.

Agent: Of course. Again, I apologize for the trouble. Your service number is 7849302. You'll get a confirmation, and a technician will see you tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll get you back up and running.

Customer: Alright, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
