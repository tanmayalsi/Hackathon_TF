Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went down like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got work stuff I need to do and it's kind of a mess right now.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147... and what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's under Michael Torres.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got you here. So you're saying your internet went down about an hour ago. Have you tried unplugging the modem and router yet?

Customer: Yeah, I did that actually. I unplugged them for like thirty seconds and plugged them back in, and... nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, okay. Well, let's try that one more time, but let's leave them unplugged for a full two minutes this time. Sometimes they need a bit longer to fully reset. Can you do that for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, sure. I'll do it now.

Agent: Great, thanks. I'll be right here.

Customer: (pause) (background noise of something being unplugged) Alright, they're unplugged. I'm gonna wait here...

Agent: Perfect. So while we're waiting, let me ask you a few questions. Have you noticed any storms in your area recently, or any work being done outside? Sometimes that can affect the lines.

Customer: Um, no, nothing like that. It's been pretty clear out all day actually.

Agent: Alright. And you said this is your work internet, so I'm guessing you really need this up and running.

Customer: (frustrated) Yeah, I've got a client call in like twenty minutes and I'm supposed to be on my home office setup. This is not ideal timing.

Agent: I understand completely. Okay, go ahead and plug those back in for me.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, they're back in. Let me... (pause) No, nope. Still nothing. The lights aren't even coming on on the modem like they normally do.

Agent: The lights aren't coming on at all? Not even the power light?

Customer: Right, like... nothing. It's completely dark. That's weird, right?

Agent: (pause) Hmm, that could suggest a power issue. Can you check the power cable for me? Is it fully seated in both the modem and the wall outlet?

Customer: (typing sounds in background, then pause) Yeah, it looks... it looks like it's in there pretty good. Let me try a different outlet though.

Agent: Good thinking. Go ahead.

Customer: (background noise of things being moved) Okay, I'm plugging it into the outlet by my desk instead. The other one's got like three things plugged into it anyway.

Agent: (pause) Alright, and...?

Customer: Still nothing. (frustrated sigh) This is ridiculous.

Agent: Okay, I know this is frustrating. Let me check a couple of things on my end. Can you tell me... do you have a battery backup unit connected to your modem? Sometimes those can cause issues.

Customer: (pause) I... I'm not sure what that is, actually. Is that like a big box thing?

Agent: It could be, yeah. It might say "UPS" on it. Do you see anything like that near your modem?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't think so. Just the modem, the router, and the power cables.

Agent: Alright. (typing sounds) Let me pull up our system here and see if we're showing any outages in your area. (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages right now in your neighborhood, which is good news and bad news. Good news is it's probably not a wider issue. Bad news is it's likely something specific to your equipment.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: Well, it really sounds like a power issue with the modem itself. Did you happen to get any warning before it went out? Like, did you notice any flickering or anything unusual?

Customer: No, not that I noticed. It was just... working, and then it wasn't.

Agent: Have you tried checking if the power outlet is working? You could plug something else in there, like a lamp, just to see if the outlet itself has power.

Customer: (pause) Oh, that's... that's actually a good idea. Hang on. (background noise) I'm gonna plug this desk lamp in.

Agent: Okay.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the lamp's on. So the outlet's working fine.

Agent: Good, so the outlet's definitely good. (pause) At this point, Michael, I'm pretty confident the issue is with the modem itself. It's most likely a hardware failure of some kind. The fact that there's no power indicator at all is a pretty strong indicator.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, I can't use it?

Agent: Well, normally in this situation, we'd get you a replacement modem sent out right away. However, I do want to check one more thing with you. When was the last time you restarted your modem? Like, not just unplugged it, but let it sit unplugged for five minutes while you also unplugged the router?

Customer: I just did that like... what, five minutes ago? Well, two minutes anyway.

Agent: Right, right, I remember. Just making sure. Okay, um... (pause) Let me escalate this for you. I'm going to transfer you to our technical support team. They might have a few additional troubleshooting steps, but I'm pretty confident they're going to recommend a modem replacement. They'll be able to get that sent out to you much faster than I can from here.

Customer: How long is that gonna take? I really need this working soon.

Agent: That's a great question. When you speak with them, definitely let them know about your client call in twenty minutes. They might have some options for expedited shipping. Can I put you on a brief hold while I transfer you over? Should only be about 30 seconds.

Customer: (frustrated) Yeah, okay. Do what you gotta do.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. One moment please.

(hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Michael? You still there?

Customer: Yep, I'm here.

Agent: Great. I've got the technical support team ready for you. I'm transferring you over now to my colleague James. He's going to take great care of you.

Customer: Alright, thanks Derek.

Agent: Sorry we couldn't get this resolved on the first try, but James is really good at this stuff. Thanks for your patience, and I hope you get this working before your call.

Customer: Thanks, I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Transferring you now.
