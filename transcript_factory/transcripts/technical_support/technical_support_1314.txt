# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because my internet just went out. It was working fine this morning and now I can't get online at all.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back up and running. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Uh, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Thank you. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Alright, I've got you here. So you're saying your internet stopped working this morning? Did anything happen before it went out? Like a storm, power outage, or did you restart anything?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I was just working from home and it just... stopped. Like, the router's still on, the lights are still blinking, but nothing's connecting.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the equipment is powered on but you're not getting a connection. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your modem and router right now?

Customer: Uh... (pause) I see... there's a green light on top. And then below that there's like... a red or orange light that's blinking. Is that bad?

Agent: The red or orange light typically indicates there's an issue with the connection to our network. That's what we'd expect to see if the internet is down. Let's try a reboot. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Yeah, doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And while that's unplugged, can you also unplug your router?

Customer: The separate box? Yeah, I'm unplugging that too. (pause) Done.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give those about 30 seconds to fully power down. (pause) While we wait, have you had any issues with your service recently? Any outages or slowdowns?

Customer: No, nothing. It's been great actually. This is the first real problem I've had since I got Frontier installed like six months ago.

Agent: That's good to hear. Okay, it should be about 30 seconds now. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: And just give that about 30 seconds to boot up. You should see the lights come back on.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, I see the lights coming back. Green on top and... (pause) ...and it's still that red or orange one down there.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: (pause) It's in. (longer pause) Still the same thing though. The red light's still blinking.

Agent: Alright. Um, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Have you checked to see if there are any service outages in your area? Actually, let me pull that up for you. What's your service address?

Customer: It's 4521 Maple Drive, Apartment 2B.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not showing any active outages in your area right now. Let me try a couple more things. Are you able to see any cables coming out of the wall into your modem?

Customer: Yeah, I see a cable coming in from the wall and then cables going out to... it looks like a battery backup thing.

Agent: Okay, good. Can you check those cables and just make sure they're all plugged in nice and snug? Sometimes they can work themselves loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, they all feel pretty tight. I don't think that's it.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else. Can you hold for just a quick second? I'm going to see if I can access your modem remotely.

Customer: Okay, no problem.

Agent: (brief hold music) (pause) Thank you for holding. Okay, I'm having trouble connecting to your modem remotely, which is usually what we can see when there's a network-side issue. Let me check our system here to see if there's something on our end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, okay, um... I'm showing that your modem registered with our network about... (pause) ...about 45 minutes ago, and then it dropped off.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it a problem with my modem?

Agent: It could be, but it could also be an issue with the line coming into your building. Since you're in an apartment, there might be something happening with the infrastructure. Let me try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? There should be a small button on the back that you'd need to hold for about 15 seconds.

Customer: A reset? Will that... will that erase anything?

Agent: It shouldn't affect anything on your end, no. It just resets the modem back to factory settings so it can re-register with our network fresh.

Customer: Okay, I'm looking for the button. (pause) I think I found it. It's like a tiny hole?

Agent: Yes, exactly. You might need a paperclip or a pen to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I got a pen. I'm holding it in... (pause) [inaudible] ...nothing's happening.

Agent: You should see the lights go dark for a few seconds while it resets.

Customer: (longer pause) Okay, the lights went off and now they're coming back on. The green light's there and... (longer pause) ...the red light's still there.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Alright, David, I'm going to be honest with you. We've gone through the basic troubleshooting and normally one of these steps clears it up. Since we're still seeing that red light and the modem dropped off our network, I'm pretty confident this is either a hardware issue with the modem itself or a problem with the line coming into your building.

Customer: So what do we do? Can you send someone out to look at it?

Agent: Absolutely. I can definitely set up a technician visit for you. (typing sounds) The earliest I can get someone out is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? Yeah, I guess that works. I was hoping to get this fixed today though.

Agent: I understand. I wish I could get someone out sooner, but that's the first available slot. Let me just confirm some information. Your address is 4521 Maple Drive, Apartment 2B, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: And what's the best number for the technician to reach you at?

Customer: Same number you have on file should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, you're all set. Your appointment is scheduled for tomorrow, Saturday, from 8 AM to 12 PM. You should receive a confirmation text in just a moment. The technician will be able to determine if it's the modem or a line issue and get that taken care of for you.

Customer: Okay. And is there anything I should do in the meantime?

Agent: You can leave the modem and router powered on with that configuration so the technician can see what we're seeing. But honestly, I don't think another reboot would hurt either if you want to try one more time.

Customer: Alright, I'll try it one more time, but I'm not expecting much at this point.

Agent: I don't blame you. I really do apologize that we couldn't get this resolved today, David. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll see you tomorrow I guess... well, I'll see the technician tomorrow.

Agent: Great. Thank you so much for your patience, and we really appreciate your business with Frontier. We'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks, I appreciate it.

Agent: Have a great day, David.

Customer: You too.
