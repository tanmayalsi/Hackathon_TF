# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without service for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm showing service at 2847 Maple Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So your internet is completely down right now? You're not seeing any connection at all?

Customer: No, nothing. My WiFi router isn't even showing that it has internet. Like, the light is off or something. It was working fine last night, and then this morning I woke up and it was just... gone.

Agent: Alright, let me walk you through a few troubleshooting steps. First, can you tell me what color the lights are on your modem right now?

Customer: Um, okay, hold on. (pause) They're like... red, I think. And there's no light on the WiFi part.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing a red light on the modem itself. That typically indicates no internet connection. Let's start with the basics. Can you unplug the modem from the power source for me?

Customer: The modem, yeah. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And while that's unplugged, can you also unplug your router?

Customer: My router? Yeah, sure, I can do that. (pause) Both unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Let's wait about 30 seconds for everything to fully power down.

Customer: (pause) Okay.

Agent: (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first. We want to let that boot up completely before we plug in the router.

Customer: (pause) Plugged it back in. How long do I wait?

Agent: Give it about two to three minutes. You should see the lights start changing. First they'll be red, then you should see some amber or yellow lights, and eventually you want to see a solid green light. That'll indicate that it's connected to the network.

Customer: Okay... (long pause) I'm still seeing red. It's been like a minute and a half, I guess.

Agent: That's okay, it might take a little longer. While we wait, let me ask you a couple of questions. Have you had any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: No, not that I know of. The power's been fine. I mean, the lights in my house are all on.

Agent: Okay, good to know. And have you made any changes to your equipment recently? New devices connected, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. I mean, we had some friends over yesterday but... no, nothing's changed with the equipment.

Agent: Right, okay. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm showing that your account is active and there's no service outage reported in your area. The line itself appears to be functioning. Alright, how are those lights looking now?

Customer: Um... still red. Maybe a little bit of orange now? But mostly red.

Agent: Okay, we're getting somewhere. It can take a few minutes. Let me just double-check something—you're looking at the modem and not the router, correct?

Customer: Yes, I'm looking at the modem. The router's still unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give it another 30 seconds or so, and then we'll plug the router back in. (pause) How's it looking?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm seeing more orange now. And there's like a white light too, I think.

Agent: Good! That white light is typically a signal light. So we're making progress. Why don't you go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged it back in. So now what?

Agent: Now we want to give the router another minute or two to boot up and sync with the modem. Once it's fully booted, you should start seeing lights on the WiFi indicator. Does your router have a WiFi button or anything like that?

Customer: No, I don't think so. It's just a pretty standard router.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. Some routers boot up automatically. Let's just... let's give it another minute here. (pause) Alright, it's been about a minute. Are you seeing any lights on the router now?

Customer: I'm looking at it... no. No, nothing. The modem still has that orange and white light, but the router... there's nothing.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's unusual. Let me have you check the back of the router. Is there a power cable firmly connected?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... it looks pretty plugged in. Let me check. (pause) It feels secure.

Agent: And the ethernet cable between the modem and the router—that's connected on both ends?

Customer: Oh! Um... (pause) Actually, I'm not sure. Let me look. Oh, wait. I don't... I don't see an ethernet cable. Is there supposed to be one?

Agent: Well, some people do use ethernet cables to connect the modem and router, but if your router is set up to work wirelessly from the modem, that's not necessarily required. However, let me ask—is your router a WiFi-only router, or does it have ethernet ports on the back?

Customer: (pause) It has... I see some ports in the back. Yellow ones?

Agent: Those are likely ethernet ports. Okay, let me try something else. Can you unplug the router again for me and leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds?

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: And while that's unplugged, can you check the connection from the modem to the wall outlet? There should be a coaxial cable—it looks kind of thick and has a connector on the end. Can you just give that a gentle tug to make sure it's tight?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the back of the modem. I see a cable... is it the one that screws on?

Agent: Yes, exactly. That one. Give it a gentle clockwise turn just to make sure it's snug.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that. It felt a little loose, actually.

Agent: [inaudible] Oh, that might have been it! Sometimes these can work their way loose, especially if you've had any vibrations or anything. Alright, let's go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugged it back in.

Agent: Give it a minute to boot up. (pause) Okay, while that's happening, I'm going to check something here. (typing sounds) I'm actually running a line test right now... (pause) Huh.

Customer: What? What does that mean?

Agent: I'm getting a signal on the line, but it's reading a little weak. It might just be taking time to fully sync though. Let's see what's happening with the router.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing on the router. No lights.

Agent: Okay, that's... that's concerning. Let me try one more thing. Do you have your phone handy?

Customer: Yeah, I have it right here. Why?

Agent: I want you to check if you're picking up any WiFi networks. Can you look at your available networks?

Customer: Oh, good idea. (pause) I'm looking... I see my neighbor's network, and... no, I don't see mine.

Agent: You don't see your Frontier network listed?

Customer: No, nothing. Just my neighbor's and a couple of others.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I see. So the router isn't broadcasting a signal at all. That's an issue. Let me check... (typing sounds) I'm pulling up your service history here. Do you know when this equipment was installed?

Customer: I... I'm not really sure. We've had it for a while. Maybe like... two years?

Agent: Two years, okay. That's helpful. And you haven't noticed any issues before today?

Customer: No, not really. It's just been working fine. This is the first problem I've had.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Based on what we're seeing here, I think there might be an issue with either the router itself or possibly the modem. The line seems to be active, but the connection isn't completing properly, and your router isn't broadcasting. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, what do I do?

Agent: Well, normally at this point I would recommend a few more troubleshooting steps, but given what we're seeing, I think we should get a technician out to your location to physically check the equipment and the line. They'll be able to diagnose exactly what's going on.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back soon. I work from home sometimes.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) The soonest I can get someone out would be... (pause) tomorrow morning between 8 and 12. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... well, I guess that's better than nothing. But what about today?

Agent: Unfortunately, our technicians are pretty booked this afternoon, but tomorrow morning is the earliest slot I have available.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, fine. Tomorrow morning.

Agent: Great. Let me get that set up for you. That'll be tomorrow, [inaudible], between 8 AM and noon at 2847 Maple Drive. Can I get a phone number where they can reach you?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the same number I gave you.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap everything we've tried today: we've done a full power cycle of both the modem and router, we've checked the physical connections, and we've confirmed that the line is active but the connection isn't fully establishing and your router isn't broadcasting a signal. Based on that, a technician will need to come out and assess the equipment.

Customer: Yeah, okay. So I just... I'll see them tomorrow then?

Agent: Yes, tomorrow morning. They'll be there between 8 and noon. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just hope they can fix it quickly.

Agent: I'm sure they will. I'm sorry you're experiencing this issue, but our technician will get to the bottom of it tomorrow. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all. Thank you, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your patience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
