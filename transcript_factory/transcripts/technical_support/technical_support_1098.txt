# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got some work stuff I need to do from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here... And your name is Michael Patterson?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet went down this morning. When exactly did you notice it stop working?

Customer: Um, around 8:30 or so? I tried to load something and the page just wouldn't load. I waited a few minutes thinking maybe it was just slow, but nothing happened.

Agent: Alright, and have you tried restarting your modem yet?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I did that right away. I unplugged it, waited like a minute, plugged it back in. Nothing.

Agent: Okay, good. Let me just check your account here. (pause) I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, which is good news. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the modem lights on at all?

Customer: Uh, hold on. Let me... okay, so I'm looking at it now. I see a power light, it's on and it's like a blue color. But then the other lights... the internet light I guess? It's not lit up at all. It's dark.

Agent: Okay, so the power light is blue and solid, but the internet or online light is off. That's helpful. Do you have any other lights that might be on?

Customer: There's like a... I think it says "WiFi" or something? That one's off too.

Agent: Alright. And this modem, do you know what model it is? Is it a white box or black?

Customer: It's, um, white and kind of rectangular shaped. I don't... I can't really see a model number from where I'm sitting.

Agent: (typing) No problem. Can you unplug the modem for me? And if you have a modem and router as separate devices, just unplug the modem for now.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it. (pause) Done.

Agent: Great. Now can you leave that unplugged for about 30 seconds? I want to let the system reset.

Customer: Sure, I'm just... I'm looking out my window while we wait.

Agent: (pause) Okay, 30 seconds should be up. Go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: Plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's in.

Agent: Good. Let's wait for it to boot up. This usually takes about a minute or two. You should see the lights come back on.

Customer: (pause) Um, the power light came back. Still just blue power though. The other ones are still... they're not coming on.

Agent: Hmm, okay. How long has it been?

Customer: Maybe like 45 seconds?

Agent: Let's give it another minute or so just to be safe.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) Still just the power light, Derek. Same as before.

Agent: Alright, that's not what we want to see. Let me ask you a few more questions. Do you have a cable connected from the wall to the modem?

Customer: A cable? Yeah, I think so. There's like a coax cable or something, right? Coming from the wall outlet?

Agent: Exactly. Can you check if that's plugged in securely? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, checking... it feels pretty tight to me, but let me just... (sounds of movement) Let me unplug it and plug it back in real quick.

Agent: Good idea.

Customer: (sounds of unplugging and plugging) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: And you got it pretty snug?

Customer: Yeah, it's in there.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Are you seeing any change in the lights now?

Customer: No, still... still just the power light. Nothing else is lighting up.

Agent: Okay, that's frustrating. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm looking at your line here, and I'm not getting a signal coming from our equipment. Is there any chance there's been construction or any work going on near your house? Anything like that?

Customer: No, not that I'm aware of. Everything's been pretty normal around here.

Agent: Alright. And you haven't made any changes to the modem or... anything like that recently?

Customer: No, nothing. It was working fine yesterday, and this morning it just stopped.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm thinking this might be an issue on our end or possibly with your modem hardware. I'm going to try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the modem?

Customer: A factory reset? Um... how do I do that?

Agent: There should be a small button on the back of the modem. It might be recessed, so you might need a paper clip or a pen.

Customer: Oh, yeah, I see it. There's like a little button back here that's kind of tucked in.

Agent: Perfect. I want you to hold that down for about 10 seconds while the modem is powered on.

Customer: Okay, holding it... (pause) Still holding... (pause) Alright, 10 seconds. Releasing it now.

Agent: Good. Let's see if that does anything.

Customer: (pause) Okay... the lights just went out for a second and now the power light's back. But again, same thing as before. Just the power light.

Agent: (pause) I was really hoping that would work. Unfortunately, what you're describing—where only the power light is coming on and we're not seeing a signal on our end—that typically indicates either an issue with your modem hardware or something's happened on our equipment side.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, how do I fix it?

Agent: Well, there are a couple of options. Since we've ruled out the most common fixes, it's likely going to require either a technician visit to check the line coming into your house, or we may need to send you a replacement modem.

Customer: How long would a technician take? I kind of need this working today if possible.

Agent: I understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest I'm showing for a technician would be... tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 6 PM. But I can also start the process for a replacement modem that could potentially arrive within a few business days.

Customer: So neither of those is like... today?

Agent: Unfortunately, I'm not seeing any same-day options available right now. I know that's not ideal. Given that it's looking like a hardware issue, I'd probably recommend requesting the technician visit for tomorrow so they can diagnose what's actually happening. That way you know exactly what the problem is.

Customer: Yeah, I guess that's... that's my best option then. Can we set that up?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you.
