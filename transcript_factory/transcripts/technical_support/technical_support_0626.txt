Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um... my internet went down about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of. I don't know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account here. And your name is?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. No internet at all. I've got the Frontier router—the white one—and the lights are just... they're all off. Well, except for the power light, I think.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. Let's start with the basics. Can you tell me if the modem is actually plugged in? And are you hearing any sounds from it, like fans or anything?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's definitely plugged in. I can see the power cord is connected to the wall outlet. Um, the power light is on, I can see that now that I'm looking closer. But the other lights... I don't see anything lighting up.

Agent: Okay, so we've got power to the device. That's good. Have you had any storms in your area recently, or anything else unusual happen before the internet stopped working?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine this morning. I was working from home, had Zoom calls and everything was good. Then I went out for lunch, and when I came back, nothing.

Agent: Alright. So let me have you do a quick restart. Can you unplug the modem and router from the power outlet? Just pull them both out.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, sure. Okay, they're unplugged.

Agent: Great. Can you leave them unplugged for about 30 seconds? While we're waiting, are there any cables in the back that look loose or disconnected?

Customer: (pause) Uh, let me see... (background noise) No, everything looks pretty snug back there. There's the power cable, and then there's a cable coming in from the wall, and then my computer is hooked up with Ethernet.

Agent: Perfect. That coaxial cable coming in from the wall—that's the one we're really concerned with. Does it look like it's screwed on tight?

Customer: Yeah, looks like it's on there pretty good.

Agent: Okay, good. Now, go ahead and plug both devices back in. We'll give them a minute or two to boot back up.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Alright, they're plugged back in. I can see the power light again.

Agent: Great. Now while we wait, let me ask—do you have any other devices connected to your Wi-Fi that you could check? Like a phone or a tablet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I've got my phone right here. Let me see... (pause) No, it's not showing my Frontier network in the available networks. That's weird.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That tells me the router might not be broadcasting the signal. Let me check the status of your account here. (typing sounds) I'm seeing that your service is provisioned and active on our end, so it's not an issue from our network side. 

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It means your internet connection is active, but something's preventing it from reaching your home equipment. It could be the modem, the router, or possibly the line coming into your house. Give me another moment here—let's see if the lights are coming back up on the modem.

Customer: (pause) The power light's on... and I think I'm seeing maybe a green light? It's a little hard to tell from where I'm sitting.

Agent: Can you get closer to it and tell me exactly what lights you see?

Customer: (background noise, pause) Okay, so... the power light is definitely on. There's like a green light, but it's not really blinking. It looks like it's just... solid green. And that's it.

Agent: (pause) And you're not seeing any lights for internet or connection status?

Customer: No, nothing. Just that one green light and the power.

Agent: Okay, that's... that's actually what we need to address. That light should be indicating a connection. Let me have you do something else. Can you look at the back of the modem and tell me if you see anything that looks like a reset button?

Customer: A reset button? Um... (pause) there's like a small hole here with... it says "Reset" next to it.

Agent: Perfect. That's the one. I'm going to have you press that with a paperclip or something thin, but I want to warn you—this is going to reset the modem to factory settings, so we might need to reconfigure your connection after. Do you want to go ahead?

Customer: I mean... yeah, sure. Let me find a paperclip. (pause) Okay, I found one.

Agent: Great. Just press it in for about 10 to 15 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright, doing it now. (pause) The lights went out completely.

Agent: That's normal. They should come back up in about a minute or so. Let's just wait and see what happens.

(long pause, background noise)

Customer: Um, okay, so... the lights are coming back. The power light, and then... (pause) ...just the power light still.

Agent: Still just the one light?

Customer: Yeah, just power. Same as before.

Agent: (sigh) Okay. Let me check something on my end real quick. (typing sounds, pause) David, I'm going to be honest with you—what you're describing is typically indicative of either a modem failure or a signal issue on the line. Have you noticed any unusual activity with your bill or your account recently?

Customer: No, everything's been normal. Why?

Agent: Just checking. It's rare, but sometimes equipment fails. I'm going to need to escalate this. Can you hold for just one moment while I get my supervisor involved?

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent: (brief hold music)

Agent: David, I'm back. So here's what we're looking at. Given that the modem isn't responding normally after a reset, and we're not seeing a connection light, it's likely a hardware failure. We have a few options. We can get a technician out to your home to diagnose the issue in person, or we can send you a replacement modem.

Customer: How long would a technician take to get here?

Agent: Let me check the availability. (typing sounds, pause) The earliest we have open is... it looks like Wednesday of next week. We could potentially do next Saturday if that works better for you.

Customer: Next week? That's... I work from home, I really need this fixed sooner than that.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry about that. The alternative would be a replacement modem sent overnight. You'd get it tomorrow, though you might need to go through some setup steps.

Customer: (pause) How complicated is the setup?

Agent: It's usually pretty straightforward—you'd plug it in, connect the coaxial cable, and then we can walk you through provisioning it over the phone. But... I do want to be transparent... there's also a possibility that the issue is with the line coming to your house, which a modem replacement wouldn't fix.

Customer: So it might not even work?

Agent: That's... possible, yes. If it doesn't work after you set up the replacement modem, then we'd definitely need to send a technician to check the external line.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I... I guess let's try the replacement modem. I don't really have a choice.

Agent: I appreciate your patience. I'm getting that set up for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I have an overnight modem coming to you tomorrow. You should receive it by end of business day. When it arrives, go ahead and give us a call back, and we can walk through the setup.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: You can try unplugging everything for about five minutes and letting it sit, then plugging it back in. Sometimes that can help, but honestly, based on what we've seen, I'm not overly hopeful. The replacement modem tomorrow is really your best bet.

Customer: Okay. Thank you, I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today, David. We really appreciate your business, and we'll get you back online as soon as we can. You should receive a tracking number via text or email within a few hours. Do you have any other questions for me?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good day.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Goodbye.
