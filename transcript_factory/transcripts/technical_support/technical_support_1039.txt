Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I work from home and I've already missed a couple of meetings.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at the account for Michael Chen at 447 Maple Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage this morning. Have you tried any basic troubleshooting steps yet, like restarting your modem and router?

Customer: I tried restarting the modem, yeah. I unplugged it, waited like thirty seconds, and plugged it back in. But nothing changed. The router's still just... it's dark. No lights are coming on.

Agent: Okay, okay. So the router isn't showing any lights at all. That's helpful information. Let me ask you this—when you look at your modem, the device that came from Frontier, do you see any lights on that one?

Customer: (pause) The modem... yeah, actually, there are some lights on the modem. There's like a power light that's on, and I think there's one that says "internet" but it's red.

Agent: A red internet light—that indicates there's no signal coming into your modem. That's actually really good information because it helps narrow things down. Can you tell me what model modem you have? It should say on the front or back of the device.

Customer: Um... (pause) It says... Frontier... and then there's some numbers. It looks like an FX-something. FX... 3000? I think?

Agent: FX3000, great. Okay, Michael, I'm going to have you do a couple things for me. First, I need you to check the cable that's going into the modem—the one that's coming from the wall. Can you unplug that for me and let me know if you see any visible damage? Any fraying or bending or anything like that?

Customer: (background noise of movement) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. It looks... pretty normal to me? The end is a little dirty maybe, but I don't see any breaks or anything.

Agent: Good, good. Let me have you try reconnecting that cable, and make sure it's screwed in really tight on both ends—both where it connects to the wall and where it connects to the modem.

Customer: (sounds of movement and effort) Okay, yeah, I'm tightening it... it was a little loose actually. I'm tightening it more... is that tight enough?

Agent: That should be good. Now let's wait just one moment and see if that internet light changes color.

(pause for about 10 seconds)

Customer: Still red. Still nothing.

Agent: Still red. Alright, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your line status here, and actually... I'm not seeing an active connection on our network for your address. That's interesting. Let me check if there have been any outages in your area today.

Customer: Oh, is there an outage? Because I don't remember seeing anything about an outage.

Agent: Let me see here... I'm not showing a widespread outage in your area, but there could be something localized to your neighborhood. Let me have you try one more thing. I need you to do a complete restart of your modem. Can you unplug it from the power source?

Customer: Yeah, one second. (sounds of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about two minutes. I know it's not fun to wait, but this does a hard reset on the device.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Alright, it's been like two minutes now.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, plugging it in now.

Agent: And we're going to wait for the modem to fully boot up. You should see the lights come back on one at a time. Let me know when you see the internet light.

(pause for about 20 seconds)

Customer: Okay, so the power light is back on, and I see a few other lights now, but the internet one is still red. It's been like... I don't know, thirty seconds?

Agent: Hmm, it's usually faster than that. Let's give it another minute just to be safe.

(pause for about 60 seconds)

Customer: Nope, still red. This is ridiculous.

Agent: I understand your frustration. (pause) Okay, let me check something. Can you tell me if you see a battery backup unit connected to your modem? It would look like a rectangular box, usually black or gray, attached to the modem or near it.

Customer: No, I don't see anything like that. Just the modem itself.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. Michael, I think at this point there might be an issue with the line coming into your address from our network, or potentially the modem itself is having an issue. Unfortunately, troubleshooting over the phone is limited. I think we need to get a technician out to your location to do a full diagnostic.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) I can schedule a technician visit for tomorrow between 1 PM and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: I mean, I need this fixed today if possible. I'm working from home and this is... this is a big problem.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see if there's any same-day availability. (pause, typing) Unfortunately, our technicians are pretty booked up today, but I can put you on a priority list and if there's a cancellation, we'll call you to see if you can make it.

Customer: That's... that's not great, but okay. What about the 1 to 5 PM window tomorrow?

Agent: Yes, tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, I can definitely get you scheduled. There will be no charge for the service call since we're diagnosing the issue. A technician will come out and check the line, the modem, and everything else.

Customer: Alright, I guess I'll do that. But what am I supposed to do until then? I really need internet today.

Agent: I know this is frustrating. Do you have any other options for internet access? A mobile hotspot, or perhaps a coffee shop or library you could work from?

Customer: I mean, I have a hotspot on my phone, but it's not the same. I have a lot of data I need to upload for work, and a hotspot isn't going to cut it.

Agent: Unfortunately, I don't have any other technicians available today, but I do want to mention that we can credit your account for today's outage once service is restored. Let me get you confirmed for tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, fine. Yeah, get me scheduled.

Agent: Great. So we have you down for a technician visit tomorrow, Friday, between 1 PM and 5 PM at 447 Maple Drive. A technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive. Is the phone number we have on file, 555-0147, still the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. Your appointment confirmation number is 487-FRT-92. I'm going to text that to the phone number on your account, and you'll also receive an email confirmation. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Michael?

Customer: No, I guess not. I just hope this gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I understand, and we'll make sure our technician takes good care of you. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we apologize for the inconvenience today.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.
