Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is David. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here so I can help get you back online. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's Robert Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Robert. I've got you here. I'm showing you're on our Fiber 200 plan. So your internet's completely down then?

Customer: Yeah, completely. Nothing. The modem's got some lights on it but they're red, I think? I'm not really... I don't know much about this stuff.

Agent: No worries at all, that's what I'm here for. Those lights can actually tell us a lot. Let me walk you through some troubleshooting, okay? First, can you tell me—when you look at the modem, do you see any lights that are green at all, or are they all red?

Customer: (pause) Um... there's one that's kind of... it might be orange? I'm not sure. It's hard to tell with the lighting in here.

Agent: Okay, that's alright. So what we're gonna do is, I want you to unplug the modem—just pull the power cable out of the back. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. This is gonna restart the modem and sometimes that clears things right up.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) There's... it's doing something. Lights are blinking.

Agent: Perfect, that's normal. Those lights will cycle through for maybe a minute or two while it's restarting. Just give it about two minutes and then try opening a web browser and see if you can get online.

Customer: (pause, background noise of typing) Okay... nope. Still nothing. It's just... the page won't load.

Agent: Alright, no problem. Let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm actually seeing that there might be an issue with your connection coming into your home. I'm showing some signal degradation on our line here.

Customer: What does that mean? Is that... is that bad?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It could be a loose connection somewhere, or there might be something affecting the line quality outside your home. Let me ask you—have you noticed any recent storms in your area, or any work being done on the lines?

Customer: No, not that I've seen. I mean, it was fine yesterday, you know? Everything was working great.

Agent: I understand. Okay, so let me ask you a couple other things. Do you have any splitters on your lines? Like, are you splitting the connection for any other devices?

Customer: Um... (pause) I don't think so? I just plugged the modem in where it goes.

Agent: Okay, that's good. And you're connected directly from the wall outlet to the modem? Nothing in between?

Customer: Right, yeah. Straight from the wall to the modem.

Agent: Alright. (typing sounds) You know what, let me check if there's maybe an issue with the line outside. We've had some work in that area. Can you give me just a moment?

Customer: Sure.

Agent: (pause, hold music) (pause, approximately 30 seconds)

Agent: Okay, Robert, I'm back. So I'm showing that there was actually some maintenance work done on your line two days ago, and it's possible something wasn't reconnected properly. I'm also seeing your modem isn't getting a proper downstream signal. What I'd really like to do is have one of our technicians come out to your place and check both the modem and the line coming into your home. Would that work for you?

Customer: A technician? Like, how long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: Well, let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) I've got an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we could potentially get someone out Friday afternoon. What works better for your schedule?

Customer: Tomorrow morning is... yeah, that could work. I can be home.

Agent: Great. So that's tomorrow, between 8 AM and noon. Before I schedule that, let me just try one more thing real quick, okay? 

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: I'm gonna send a reset signal to your modem from here. It's not gonna hurt anything, but it might restart it. Just watch and let me know if anything changes with those lights.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Okay, it's restarting again.

Agent: (pause) Alright, can you try that browser again?

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) No... still nothing. Same thing.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, okay. Unfortunately that didn't do it. This is definitely looking like something physical that we're gonna need to check out in person. So let me get you scheduled for tomorrow morning. Do you have a cell phone number I can reach you at if the technician needs to contact you?

Customer: It's 555-0892.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, so I've got you down for tomorrow, 8 AM to noon. The technician will come out and check the modem and your external line. Is there anything else I should note on your account? Any particular entrance they should use, or anything like that?

Customer: Um, just the front door should be fine. The driveway's on the left side of the house.

Agent: Got it. (typing sounds) Alright, Robert, I've got that all scheduled. You should get a confirmation email within the next few minutes, and the technician will give you a call tomorrow morning if they're running early or late. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I really need this working. I work from home sometimes and I've got stuff I gotta do.

Agent: I completely understand. And I apologize that we couldn't get it sorted out over the phone today. But our technician will definitely track down what's going on tomorrow. If you need anything before then or after the appointment, just give us a call back.

Customer: Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome, Robert. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll get you back online ASAP.

Customer: Alright, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
