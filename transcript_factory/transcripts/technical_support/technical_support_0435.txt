Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work from home stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot that. Let me just pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. And your name is Michael Chen?

Customer: That's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Has it been completely out the whole time, or is it intermittently dropping?

Customer: No, it's completely out. Like, nothing. No connection at all. I tried unplugging the modem and router like I usually do, but that didn't work.

Agent: Okay, that's a good first step that you already tried. Um, so let's see what we can do here. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Like, is the modem showing any lights at all?

Customer: Yeah, okay, so the modem has... there's a red light on it. And the router, I think it's doing something but I'm not sure.

Agent: Alright, the red light on the modem is actually what we want to look at. So when the light is red, that usually means it's not connecting to our network. First thing I want you to do is unplug the modem for about 30 seconds, then plug it back in. And we'll give it a minute or two to boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, doing that now. (sound of unplugging) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we wait, let me ask you a few questions. Have you had any storms in your area recently? Or any construction work going on?

Customer: No storms, but... actually, yeah. They were doing some roadwork outside my building yesterday. But that was just on the street, you know?

Agent: That could potentially be related, actually. Sometimes construction can affect the line. Okay, go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Plugged back in. (pause) Okay, so... I'm seeing some lights now. There's like, a white light and then the red one is still there.

Agent: Okay, let's give it just another minute to fully boot up. Sometimes that takes a little bit.

Customer: (long pause) Yeah, so... no change. Still got the red light.

Agent: Still red, okay. Um, (typing sounds) let me check our network status in your area real quick. (pause) I'm not seeing any outages reported, so... let's try a few more things. Can you check the cable connection on the back of the modem? Make sure it's firmly plugged in?

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I'm looking at it. It looks pretty tight to me, but let me... (sound of moving things around) I'm kind of yanking on it to make sure. It seems to be in there.

Agent: Alright, good. And just to make sure we're covering all the bases, do you have a coaxial cable running from the wall into the modem? That's like the thick cable with the metal ends?

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's coming from the wall, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so let me try resetting the modem from here. I'm going to send a remote reset command to your device. This should take maybe two or three minutes, and you might see the lights flicker. Just let me know when everything settles down.

Customer: Alright, I'm watching it now. (pause) Okay, so I see... yeah, the lights are doing different things. Okay, it's... it's blinking now. (long pause) Hmm, it's still blinking.

Agent: Yeah, that's normal. It should take just a minute or two more to stabilize. While we wait, I'm also going to look into whether there were any service issues reported at your address today.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... nothing yet?

Agent: Just give it one more minute, sir.

Customer: (pause) Okay... the red light is back. (sighs) It's back to the red light.

Agent: Alright, so the reset didn't resolve it. Um... (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at your account here, and I'm not seeing any service interruptions on our end. But given that you mentioned the construction work yesterday, it's possible that the line itself might have been damaged and we're just now seeing the effects.

Customer: Oh man, really? So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, I think what we need to do is get a technician out to your location to physically inspect the line coming into your house. They can check for any damage or issues that wouldn't show up on our end.

Customer: [inaudible] Can't you just... I don't know, can you try anything else first? When can a technician even come out?

Agent: I definitely understand the frustration. Let me try one more thing. Can you restart your router as well? Unplug it, wait 30 seconds, and plug it back in.

Customer: (sighs) Sure, I'll try it.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, while you're doing that, I can tell you that I'm showing availability for a technician visit tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we can get someone out on Thursday afternoon.

Customer: (unplugging sounds) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) Tomorrow morning would be better, I think.

Agent: Perfect, I can get you scheduled for that. Let me just... (pause) Okay, router should be restarting now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's back on. (long pause) Okay, so... nope. Same thing. Red light is still there. No internet.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so unfortunately it looks like we're dealing with something on the line side that I'm not able to troubleshoot remotely. I really do think we need that technician visit to get to the bottom of this.

Customer: So I'm just going to be without internet until tomorrow?

Agent: I'm sorry, I know that's frustrating. But yes, that appears to be what we're looking at. Now, I can go ahead and get you scheduled for tomorrow morning. The window is 8 AM to noon. Is that going to work for you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess it has to. I'll just have to use my phone hotspot for work.

Agent: Alright, let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I've got you down for tomorrow, between 8 AM and noon. You should receive a text confirmation shortly. The technician will be able to inspect the exterior line and determine if there's any damage from that construction work.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. Hopefully the technician can fix it.

Agent: I'm confident they'll be able to get you sorted out. Sorry again for the inconvenience, and thanks for choosing Frontier.

Customer: Alright, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a good day.
