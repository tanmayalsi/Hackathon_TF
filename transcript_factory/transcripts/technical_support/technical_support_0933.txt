Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm really frustrated. I work from home and I've got meetings I need to get on.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be, especially when you're working from home. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got your account here. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Do you remember around what time that happened?

Customer: Yeah, it was around 8:30 or so. I was just trying to connect and the WiFi wasn't showing up. And then I checked the router and... I don't know, nothing's working.

Agent: Alright. And just to clarify, are you unable to connect to WiFi, or is your internet connection itself not working?

Customer: I mean... both, I think? The router—it's just not doing anything. Usually the lights are on, you know? The little lights? But they're all off now.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. So the router appears to be powered down or not getting power. Let me ask you a few quick questions. First, can you look at where your router is plugged in? Is the power cable connected to the outlet?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's plugged in. I can see it right there. Oh wait... actually, let me—is this outlet supposed to have power? (pause) Yeah, no, I'm getting power. The outlet's working fine. I plugged my lamp in and it turned on.

Agent: Good, so the outlet has power. Let me have you try something. Can you unplug the router from the power cable and then wait about thirty seconds?

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just let it sit for a moment, and then we'll plug it back in and see if that helps reboot the system. Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) Alright, it's in.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about a minute to boot up. Sometimes these routers take a little bit to fully restart. While we're waiting, have you noticed any outages in your area? Any storms last night or this morning?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was fine last night. I was watching Netflix and everything was working great.

Agent: Okay, good to know. (pause) And it's been about a minute now. Do you see any lights coming on on the router at all?

Customer: (pause) Um... no. No, nothing. It's still completely dark. This is... this shouldn't be happening, right?

Agent: It is unusual if the router isn't lighting up at all. Let me try one more thing. Can you check the power cable itself? Sometimes they can come loose or the connection can get a little corroded. If you can, try wiggling the connection where it plugs into the router.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Yeah, I'm... I'm looking at it now. The cable seems pretty secure. Hold on, let me... (pause) Nope, still nothing. The router's still dark.

Agent: Alright. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a quick diagnostic on your line here... (pause) Hmm. Okay, so I am seeing that your modem—that's separate from your router, by the way—I am seeing that your modem may not be online right now either. Do you have a modem as well as the router? They're usually two separate boxes, or sometimes they can be combined into one unit.

Customer: Oh. Um, I think I just have the one thing? It's kind of a white box with the Frontier logo on it.

Agent: That sounds like it might be a combined unit, which is actually helpful. Okay, so that same power cable is going into that unit?

Customer: Yeah, that's the only thing I have.

Agent: Got it. So let's verify something. You mentioned the outlet has power because your lamp worked. Can you try plugging your lamp in right next to where the modem is plugged in? Just to make absolutely sure that particular outlet has power?

Customer: (pause) Good idea. (rustling) Okay, the lamp... (pause) Yeah, the lamp turns on. So the outlet's definitely working.

Agent: Okay, so we've got power to the outlet. At this point, it's sounding like the modem unit itself might not be responding. This sometimes happens if there's an internal power issue. Let me ask you—have you had any power outages recently? Even a brief one?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of, no.

Agent: Alright. Um, I hate to ask this, but do you have another power cable you could try? Sometimes the cable itself can go bad, even though everything looks fine.

Customer: (pause) I... I don't think I have another one that would fit. My laptop charger probably won't work.

Agent: Yeah, those are usually different sizes. Okay, um... (pause) Let me think about what else we can try here. Can you describe the power cable to me? Is there anything unusual about it? Any fraying, damage, or discoloration?

Customer: (rustling) No, it looks fine to me. It's just your standard power cable. Black, normal looking.

Agent: Okay. And I know I'm asking a lot of questions, but I want to make sure we've tried everything before we escalate this. Have you tried holding the power button on the unit itself, if there is one? Sometimes a hard reset can help.

Customer: (pause) Um, I don't think there's a power button. It's just... it's got the light indicators on the front, but I don't see a button.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, yeah, most of our combined units don't have a physical power button. Alright, let me... (pause) I'm going to be honest with you. Based on everything we've tried here, it sounds like there might be a hardware issue with your modem unit. The fact that there's absolutely no power indicator at all is concerning. Usually we'd see at least some lights, even if you're not connected.

Customer: So, what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, here are our options. I can schedule a technician to come out to your location to take a look at the unit in person. They'd be able to test it properly and replace it if needed. That's usually the best course of action when there's a potential hardware failure.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet working today if possible.

Agent: (pause) Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) So our next available appointment is actually tomorrow between 10 AM and 2 PM. I know that's not ideal, but given the nature of the issue, I really think we need someone to physically look at this.

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... okay, I guess I don't have much choice. Can you make sure they bring a replacement modem?

Agent: I'm going to make a note on your account flagging this as a potential hardware failure, so the technician will definitely come prepared. They'll likely have replacement equipment with them.

Customer: Alright, I'll take it. Can I get a confirmation number or something?

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely. Your appointment confirmation number is 8847-FRN-TX. That's 8847, then FRN, then TX. The technician should arrive sometime between 10 AM and 2 PM tomorrow. They'll have your account information, so just have your ID ready when they arrive.

Customer: Okay, got it. Thank you, I guess. This is just really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. I've noted everything we tried, and the technician will see all of that when they come out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for being patient with me, and sorry again for the inconvenience. We'll get you back online tomorrow. You have a great day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
