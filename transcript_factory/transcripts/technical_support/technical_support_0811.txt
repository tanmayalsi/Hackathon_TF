# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without service for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account and we'll get you sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's, uh... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that now. Just to confirm, is this for the address on Pine Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. Pine Street, apartment 2B.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. So what's going on? Is there an outage in my area or something?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me check that for you. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area currently, so let's try some troubleshooting steps together. First, can you tell me if the modem and router are powered on?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...yeah, the lights are on. They're blinking like they normally do.

Agent: Great, that's a good sign. Okay, and when you try to connect to the internet, what exactly happens? Do you see the WiFi network showing up?

Customer: Well, that's the thing. The WiFi shows up, but when I try to connect, it just... I don't know, it doesn't work. I can see the network name, but nothing loads. It's like I'm not actually connected even though it says I am.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's helpful information. Let me ask you this – are you trying to connect with an Ethernet cable or WiFi?

Customer: WiFi. I'm on my laptop right now.

Agent: Alright. So here's what I'd like you to do. Can you go ahead and unplug the modem – that's the device that comes directly from the wall – and leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds?

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Yeah, it's off.

Agent: Good. Just let it sit for about 30 seconds. This helps clear out the memory and reset the connection to our network.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been like 30 seconds. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug it back in. It'll take a minute or two to fully boot back up. You'll know it's ready when the lights stabilize.

Customer: (pause) (background noise of device powering on) Okay, lights are coming back on. Um... (pause) ...still just blinking though.

Agent: That's normal for a minute. Let's give it another 30 seconds or so to fully connect. While we're waiting, I'm going to ask – have you had any recent storms or weather events in your area?

Customer: No, not really. It was fine last night. I just woke up this morning and nothing was working.

Agent: Okay. (pause) So how are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) ...Same. Still blinking. The white light is... (trailing off) ...yeah, it's just blinking steadily.

Agent: Alright. Let me try one more thing. Can you restart your router as well? That's usually the separate device or the all-in-one unit where your WiFi is coming from.

Customer: It's... I think it's all in one? I have one box.

Agent: Perfect. That actually makes things simpler. So unplug that device as well and give it the same 30-second wait.

Customer: (pause) Unplugging it now. (pause) Okay... (pause) ...30 seconds... (pause) ...plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Now, once that comes back online, can you try connecting your laptop to the WiFi network again?

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Okay, WiFi is showing up again. Trying to connect... (pause) ...and... (pause) ...nope. Same thing. It connects but nothing loads. Like, I can't even get to Google or anything.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay, let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a quick diagnostic on your connection. (pause) (more typing) That should take just a moment...

Customer: How long is this going to take? I've got work I need to do.

Agent: I completely understand. This should just be another minute or so. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at the diagnostics now, and I'm actually not seeing any data coming through from your modem to our network. It's like the signal isn't making it to us.

Customer: What does that mean? Is something broken?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It could be an issue with the modem itself, or there could be a problem with the line coming into your building. Have you noticed any damage to the cable outside your apartment?

Customer: I... I don't know. I haven't gone outside to check.

Agent: If you don't mind, that might actually be really helpful. Can you take a quick look? I'll stay on the line.

Customer: (pause) Okay, give me one second. (long pause) (sounds of movement, door opening) (background noise, wind) Okay, I'm outside. Um... (pause) ...I don't really see anything obviously wrong. The cable looks... normal, I guess? It's connected to the box there.

Agent: Alright. Is the cable secured tightly into the connection point?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Okay. And you're not seeing any visible damage or anything? Any loose pieces or anything like that?

Customer: No, everything looks fine from what I can see.

Agent: Alright. (pause) I think at this point, we might be looking at either a line issue or a modem issue. Since the diagnostics aren't showing any data connection on our end, I think we're going to need to send a technician out to take a look at this in person.

Customer: (pause) How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability for you. (pause) Okay, so I can get someone out to you... (pause) ...the earliest I have is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? I really need this fixed today if possible.

Agent: I completely understand, and I wish I had something sooner. Unfortunately, our technicians are booked pretty solid for the rest of today. Tomorrow morning is the earliest availability. Would that time window work for your schedule?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess it has to. Can I at least get some kind of confirmation or reference number or something?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that for you. (typing sounds) Your service appointment number is 847293. Can I get a callback number to confirm with our dispatch team?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account number.

Agent: Perfect. And just to set expectations, the technician will arrive sometime between 8 AM and noon tomorrow. They'll take a look at the line connection and the modem. If it's the modem, we can get that swapped out for you right away. If it's the line, they'll be able to assess what's needed.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Is there anything I can do in the meantime?

Agent: Unfortunately, we've kind of exhausted the troubleshooting steps on my end. I'd just recommend keeping the modem and router off until the technician gets there, and then have them plugged back in when they arrive so they can run their diagnostics with everything fresh.

Customer: Alright. I guess I'll just be offline until tomorrow then.

Agent: I'm really sorry about that. I know it's not ideal. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: We'll get you taken care of. Your appointment is all set for tomorrow, 8 AM to noon. The technician will have your account information. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, thanks. I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
