Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that, sir. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I'm showing this is a residential account on our fiber plan. And you're saying the internet went down this morning?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 a.m. I was working from home and suddenly everything just... stopped. My router lights went crazy and now nothing's connecting.

Agent: Alright. So the first thing I want to do is just walk through some basic troubleshooting steps with you. Is your modem powered on right now?

Customer: Yeah, it's on. I can see the lights are blinking, but they're not the normal color. They're more... red? Or orange? I don't know, something's definitely off.

Agent: Okay, that's actually helpful information. Red or orange lights usually indicate a connectivity issue. Can you describe exactly which lights are lit up for me?

Customer: Um, there's like... the power light is green, that's normal. But the internet light is definitely not green. It's red. And then there's one more that's like... flickering between red and orange.

Agent: Got it. So the power is good, but we're definitely seeing a connection issue. What I'd like you to do is unplug the modem for me. Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Can you leave that unplugged for about 30 seconds? I'm just going to check something on my end while we wait. (typing sounds) Still there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Alright, it's been about 30 seconds. Go ahead and plug that modem back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in... (pause) It's rebooting now. I can see the lights cycling through.

Agent: Great. Let's give it about two minutes to fully boot up. In the meantime, let me just ask—have you noticed any storms in your area recently? Sometimes weather can affect fiber connections.

Customer: No, it's been clear all week actually. And this is weird because I've had Frontier for like three years and never had a problem like this.

Agent: That's good to know. Fiber is generally pretty reliable, so that actually helps narrow things down. (pause) Okay, how are those lights looking now?

Customer: Um... still not great. The internet light is still red. The other one is still blinking red and orange.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try a different approach. I'm going to send a refresh signal to your modem from here. Can you watch and tell me if anything changes? (typing sounds)

Customer: Alright... (pause) Oh wait, something's happening. The lights are changing. Oh no, now everything just went off.

Agent: Everything went off? Even the power light?

Customer: Yeah, all of it. The whole modem just died. That's... that's not good, right?

Agent: Well, the modem shouldn't have done that. Let me have you unplug it again and wait a full minute this time.

Customer: Okay... (pause) It's unplugged. (longer pause) One minute's up.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, power light is back on. Green. Now we're waiting for the other lights...

Agent: [inaudible] ...checking the line on my end. There might be something going on with the signal strength coming into your area.

Customer: What do you mean? Is this something that's affecting other people too?

Agent: That's what I'm looking at right now. So far I'm not seeing any major outages reported in your neighborhood, but... (pause) actually, I am seeing a few alerts for your street specifically from this morning. Let me check the details here. (typing sounds)

Customer: How long do these usually last?

Agent: Well, it depends on what the issue is. Sometimes it's just a few minutes, sometimes it can be longer. (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing a ton of detail on what the issue was, but it looks like we may have had a line issue. The lights on your modem—are they stabilized at all yet?

Customer: No, they're... they're still the same. Red internet light, and this other one's still blinking. They've been like this for like thirty seconds now and aren't changing.

Agent: Okay, so the modem's not coming online. Let me try one more thing. I'm going to push a factory reset command to the device. This will restart it completely. Are you good with that?

Customer: I mean, yeah, if you think it'll help.

Agent: (typing sounds) Sending that now. (pause) You should see all the lights go out and then come back on in a cycle.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it... all the lights went dark. Now they're coming back. Power's green... (pause) Okay, and the internet light is... still red. It's not changing.

Agent: (pause) Alright, so we're still not getting an online signal. That's... (pause) Let me check something else. When you look at the modem, is there a serial number on the back? I want to make sure we're working with the correct hardware on file.

Customer: The serial number? Um, yeah, it's right here. It says... Frontier... and then FNT-GB-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up. (pause) Alright, so this is... this is actually an older model modem. We typically replaced those a couple years ago. It's possible that this unit may be failing.

Customer: Wait, so the modem's broken? Can I get a replacement?

Agent: Well, that's what I'm trying to determine. Before we go down that path, I want to rule out the external issue first. Have you checked the cable connection coming into your modem? Is it securely plugged in?

Customer: The cable? Yeah, let me check. (sounds of movement) I mean, it looks like it's plugged in pretty tight to me.

Agent: Okay, and it's the same cable that's always been there?

Customer: As far as I know, yeah. I haven't touched anything.

Agent: Alright. Let me try reaching the modem one more time. Give me just a second. (typing sounds, longer pause) (pause) I'm not getting a response on the signal, and I'm also not showing the modem registering on our network at all anymore. 

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It means the modem isn't communicating with our servers. At this point, it could be a few things—it could be the modem itself has failed, it could be a service issue on our end, or it could be the line. Normally I'd send a technician out to diagnose it properly.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back. I'm working from home today.

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately, our next available appointment... (typing sounds) (pause) ...we're looking at Thursday between 12 and 4 p.m. That's in two days.

Customer: Two days? Can't anyone come sooner than that?

Agent: I wish I could get someone there sooner. We're actually pretty booked up today and tomorrow. But if you'd like, I can note this as a priority and see if we can get someone out earlier if there's a cancellation.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Yeah, please do that.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to get this scheduled for a technician visit on Thursday. They'll be able to test the line, check the modem, and get your internet back up. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I... I guess that's it. This is just really frustrating. I've been a customer for three years and this has never happened.

Agent: I totally get that, and I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll definitely get this resolved for you on Thursday. Let me just confirm—your phone number is 555-0147, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. You should get a confirmation text and email about the appointment. The technician will call you 30 minutes before they arrive. Is there a preferred time within that Thursday window—morning or afternoon?

Customer: Um, afternoon is better for me. After 1 p.m. if possible.

Agent: Got it noted. I'll put that in the system as afternoon preferred. Is there anything else I can help clarify?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's all. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: Thank you for your patience, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone. A technician will be out Thursday afternoon, and we'll get you back online. You have a good day.

Customer: Yeah, you too.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier.
