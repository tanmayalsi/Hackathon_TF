# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out completely. Like, it's not working at all, and I don't know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm pulling up your account now. And what's your name?

Customer: It's Robert. Robert Chen.

Agent: Great, Robert. So just to confirm, you're experiencing a complete internet outage right now—nothing's working at all?

Customer: Right, yeah. I tried resetting the modem and the router, but nothing. It's just... it's not working.

Agent: Okay, I understand how frustrating that is. Let me pull up your service area first. (pause) Alright, I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area at this time, so let's do some troubleshooting together. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Are there any lights on your modem?

Customer: Um, yeah, so the modem has a red light. It's solid red.

Agent: Okay, a solid red light on the modem—that typically indicates a connection issue. And you mentioned you already tried resetting it?

Customer: Yeah, I unplugged it for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in.

Agent: Good. Did anything change after you did that? Like, did the light turn to another color at all?

Customer: (pause) No, it's still red. It's been like that for... I don't know, maybe an hour now? Maybe longer.

Agent: Alright. Let me ask you a few questions. Do you see any loose cables behind the modem? Sometimes connections can come unplugged, or there might be damage to the cable itself.

Customer: Let me... (background noise, sounds of movement) Okay, I'm back there. Uh... no, everything looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Good. And you don't see any damage to the cables? No cuts or anything like that?

Customer: No, they look fine.

Agent: Okay. One more thing I want to try—let's do a hard reset on the modem. So I want you to unplug the power cable from the back of the modem, and then hold down the reset button on the back for about ten seconds while it's unplugged.

Customer: (pause) Hold on... (background noise) Okay, I'm unplugging it now. And I'm holding down the reset button...

Agent: Just keep holding it.

Customer: ...holding... okay. It's been about ten seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug the power cable back in, and let's see what happens. It should take about two to three minutes to fully boot up.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Yeah, I'm plugging it back in now. So I'll just wait?

Agent: Exactly. Just give it a couple minutes and let me know what color the lights turn.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, so... (pause) the lights are coming on. I see green and amber now.

Agent: Great! That's a good sign. Okay, can you check your internet connection now? Try opening a website or something on your computer?

Customer: Okay, one sec. (pause) Um... no. Still nothing. I'm not getting any connection. It's still... no internet.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) Robert, I'm showing that your modem is actually not communicating with our network at this time. That's strange because the hard reset should have... let me just verify something.

Customer: Is there... I mean, is there something wrong on your end?

Agent: Let me check the line status. (pause) I'm not seeing any issues with your line itself. This is... (pause) okay, let me try one more thing. Can you restart your router as well? That's the separate device that broadcasts your Wi-Fi signal.

Customer: How do I do that?

Agent: There should be a power button on the back or bottom of the router, or you can just unplug it for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I found it. I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give that thirty seconds.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, it's been a minute now, so I'm plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. And let's give everything another minute or two to boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the router lights are on again. Still no internet though. So... what does that mean?

Agent: (pause) I'm not entirely sure what's happening here. The hard reset should've resolved this, but it doesn't seem like your modem is connecting to our network at all. Let me see... when did this stop working? Do you remember if anything unusual happened before it went out?

Customer: No, not really. I was just working this morning, and then around noon I tried to check something online and it just... wasn't there.

Agent: And you haven't had any storms or power outages or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Robert, I'm going to be honest with you—the troubleshooting steps we've done should've worked. The fact that the modem isn't connecting to our network suggests there might be an issue with either the modem itself or something on our network infrastructure side that I can't see from my end.

Customer: So what does that mean? How do I fix it?

Agent: Well, we have a couple of options. I can schedule a technician to come out and check everything—the modem, the cables, the line itself. That way we can figure out exactly what's going on.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. We could get someone out to you... (pause) it looks like we have availability tomorrow between 1 PM and 5 PM, or we have some slots next Tuesday.

Customer: Tomorrow would be better. Can we do tomorrow?

Agent: Absolutely. Tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Can I confirm that address? It's 447 Maple Street, apartment 3B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And I'm going to put your account as priority since we've already done the standard troubleshooting. The technician will be fully equipped to diagnose what's going on. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just hope it gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll get this resolved for you. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with the appointment details. And if you need to reach us before the technician arrives, just give us a call back. The number's on your bill.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, Robert. We appreciate your patience.
