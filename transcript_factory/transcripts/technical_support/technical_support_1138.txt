Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back up. I've been without service for like three hours now.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my cell, but the account's under that number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing your account here. I show you're in the Salem area, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm, you're experiencing a complete service outage—no internet at all?

Customer: Nothing. I tried turning the modem off and back on, restarting my router, all that stuff. Nothing's working.

Agent: Okay, that's good troubleshooting on your part. Let me ask you a few questions. Are you looking at your modem right now?

Customer: Yeah, it's right in front of me.

Agent: Great. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing? Are they lit up, and if so, what color are they?

Customer: (pause) So there's... there's a power light that's on, it's green. But the internet light—I think that's the one that looks like a globe or whatever—that one's not lit at all. It's completely dark.

Agent: Okay, so the internet light is dark. That's helpful. And what about the connection light? That's usually right next to it and shows activity.

Customer: Um, I'm not... I'm not totally sure which one that is, honestly.

Agent: No problem. The one I'm talking about usually blinks or has activity on it. Is there any light that's blinking or flashing?

Customer: Yeah, actually, there's one that's like, flickering a little bit. It's red, I think.

Agent: Red and flickering—okay. That typically indicates there's an issue with the connection. Let me check if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds, pause) I'm not showing any widespread outages affecting your neighborhood right now. So let's do some troubleshooting. First, can you unplug the power cable from the modem for me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds while we reset it.

Customer: (pause) Alright, counting down... okay, it's been thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now plug it back in and let's wait for it to boot back up. This usually takes a couple of minutes.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I plugged it back in. The green light's back on.

Agent: Good. Now we're going to give it a minute or two to fully boot up. While we wait, let me ask—have you made any changes to your setup recently? Moved anything around, or...?

Customer: Nope, everything's been the same for like... I don't know, six months or so.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Has the internet light come back on yet?

Customer: (pause) No... no, it's still dark. Wait—okay, the flickering light is... it's getting a little brighter now. It's still red though.

Agent: Still red, okay. That's not quite what we want to see. Let me have you check something else. Can you look at where your fiber line comes into the modem? That's usually an orange or yellow cable. Is it firmly connected?

Customer: (pause, movement sounds) Yeah, it's... it looks pretty tight. I don't think that's the issue.

Agent: Alright. And just to make sure—do you see any damage to the cable itself? Any kinks, cuts, or anything like that?

Customer: (pause) No, it looks fine from what I can see.

Agent: Okay, let me try something different. I'm going to do a remote restart on my end here. (typing sounds) Go ahead and give me just one moment...

(pause, longer silence)

Agent: Alright, I'm attempting the restart now. You might see some lights flicker or change.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. (pause) Um, the green light went off for a second... it's back on now. But that other light... [inaudible] ...still nothing.

Agent: I see the same thing on my end. The modem responded but we're still not getting that internet connection light back. This might be a line-side issue. Let me ask you—when you go to restart your router, are you seeing that connect to the modem? Or is that also showing no connection?

Customer: My router's showing... yeah, it's trying to connect to the modem but it can't. It just keeps trying. The lights keep blinking like it's looking for something.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I'm going to be honest with you—what we're seeing suggests this might be an issue on the line itself coming into your home, not something we can fix from here. I'd like to get a technician out to your address to do a physical inspection.

Customer: Oh man, really? How long is that going to take?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) I can get someone out there tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, I guess tomorrow works. I mean, I'm not happy about it, but what choice do I have?

Agent: I understand it's inconvenient. I wish we could resolve this remotely for you. Let me get some information. Is there anything else we should know about your setup? Do you have any external equipment or devices we need to be aware of?

Customer: No, it's just the standard modem and router you guys gave me.

Agent: Perfect. And is the address we have on file still current? 447 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. And a callback number where the technician can reach you?

Customer: Just use my cell—555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. Alright, so I've scheduled a technician to come out tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. They'll call you about thirty minutes before they arrive. Do you have any questions for me before I close this ticket out?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't think so. Just... hopefully they can fix it quick.

Agent: I completely understand. I apologize again that we couldn't resolve this over the phone. Our technician is very skilled and will get to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, thank you for calling Frontier Communications. We appreciate your business, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
