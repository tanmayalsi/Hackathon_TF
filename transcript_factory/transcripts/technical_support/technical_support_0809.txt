Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um, my internet went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back on. I've tried unplugging the modem and router, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm seeing your account here. So your service went out around an hour ago, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, maybe a little longer. I'm not entirely sure. I just got home from work and noticed it.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Let me ask you a few quick questions. When you look at your modem right now, what lights are you seeing? Are any of them lit up?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, there's a light on the front that's like, blinking red. And then there's another one that's... I think it's orange?

Agent: Okay, so you've got a red light blinking and an orange light. That typically indicates a connection issue with our network. But let's try a few things first. Have you had any recent storms in your area? Any power outages?

Customer: No, no storms. It's been clear all day.

Agent: Alright. And you mentioned you unplugged the modem already. When you did that, did you wait about 30 seconds before plugging it back in?

Customer: (hesitating) Um... maybe 10 seconds? I don't know, I wasn't really timing it.

Agent: No worries. Let's try that again more carefully this time. Go ahead and unplug the modem, and I want you to count to 30 before plugging it back in. I'll wait on the line.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now... (background noise of plugging) One, two, three... (pause) ...twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. Okay, plugging it back in.

(typing sounds)

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about a minute to boot back up. While we're waiting, let me ask—is there a battery backup unit connected to your modem?

Customer: A battery backup? I don't think so. It just plugs into the wall outlet.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. How about your router—is that showing any lights?

Customer: Yeah, the router has some lights. They're all green actually. That one seems fine.

Agent: That's interesting. So the router's okay but the modem is showing red and orange lights. (pause) Alright, has anything changed with your setup recently? Any new equipment, or did you move things around?

Customer: No, no. Everything's been the same for like, six months.

Agent: Understood. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any service alerts in your area. However, I am showing that we had some maintenance work done on your line earlier today. That could potentially be related. Let me run a line test real quick.

Customer: Okay... How long is this gonna take? I kind of need to get some work done tonight.

Agent: Should just be a couple minutes. Bear with me. (pause) Okay, so the line test is coming back... that's showing that we're not getting a signal on your line at all right now.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it something on my end or your end?

Agent: Well, based on what we're seeing, it's likely an issue on our infrastructure side, possibly related to that maintenance I mentioned. But let me have you check one more thing to rule out your equipment. Can you try a different outlet? Sometimes that can help us determine where the issue is.

Customer: (background noise) Um, trying a different outlet now. (pause) Nope, still the same thing. Red and orange lights.

Agent: Okay, yeah, that's what I expected. At this point, I think what we need to do is send a technician out to your location to do a physical inspection of the line. The maintenance crew may not have properly reconnected everything on their end.

Customer: A technician? When can they come out? I really need this fixed soon.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) The earliest we have available is tomorrow between 2 PM and 6 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't they come out sooner? Like tonight?

Agent: Unfortunately, our technician schedule is fully booked for today. But I can flag this as priority, which might get them here on the earlier end of that window, possibly around 2 or 3 PM.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) I guess that'll have to work. But I'm not happy about this. I've got work to do.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize. Let me make a note here that this is related to our maintenance work. (typing sounds) I'm also going to credit your account for today's outage—you'll see that reflected on your next bill.

Customer: Fine. So 2 to 6 PM tomorrow?

Agent: Yes, between 2 and 6 PM. You'll receive a call from the technician about 30 minutes before they arrive to confirm access. Your phone number is 555-0847, right?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And just to recap—we've ruled out your equipment, confirmed it's a line-side issue, likely from the maintenance work earlier. The technician will come out and inspect the physical line connection and get you back online.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Just make sure the modem and router remain plugged in so the technician can see the issue when they arrive. And if by chance it comes back online on its own before they get there, just give us a quick call back to cancel the appointment.

Customer: [inaudible] ...Yeah, will do.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Just... hopefully this gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I really do apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get you back up and running as soon as possible. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and have a good night.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
