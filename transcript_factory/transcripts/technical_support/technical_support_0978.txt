# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just stopped working like an hour ago, and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I have work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I start by getting your account information? What's the phone number or account number associated with your Frontier account?

Customer: It's, uh... (pause) 555-0147. The area code is 602.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up right now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's James Rodriguez. R-O-D-R-I-G-U-E-Z.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you James. I've got your account here. So you're saying your internet went down about an hour ago?

Customer: Yeah, just stopped. No warning or anything. One minute I was streaming something and the next minute, nothing. The connection just died.

Agent: Okay, let's see what we can do here. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Do you have any lights on your router or modem?

Customer: Um, yeah, let me look at it. (pause) So I've got the modem right here. It's... the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light, the one that usually shows the connection, it's red or orange or something. It's not the normal color.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on but the internet light is showing red or amber. That usually indicates there's no connection signal coming from our network. Have you tried restarting the modem yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, let's try that. Go ahead and unplug the modem from power, and just wait about thirty seconds while it's unplugged. That'll give it a hard reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged. Just... waiting here. (pause) Alright, thirty seconds should be about up. Plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. And while it's booting back up, let me check a couple of things on our end. (typing sounds) Let me look at your service address and see if there are any outages in your area.

Customer: (background noise of beeping sounds) Okay, so the lights are coming back on. The power light is... it's green again. (pause) But, um, the internet light is still... it's still red or orange. It's definitely not green like it should be.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's not what we want to see. Let me check... (pause, typing sounds) Alright, so I'm not seeing any outages in your area, which is good news. The issue seems to be specific to your connection. Can you tell me what kind of modem you have? Is it a Frontier-provided modem or your own equipment?

Customer: It's the one you guys gave me, I think. Let me see... (pause) It says "Frontier" on it, yeah. The box is kind of old though. I've had this setup for like four or five years.

Agent: Okay, got it. And is there a router connected to the modem, or is the modem doing the WiFi as well?

Customer: Yeah, I've got a separate router. The modem and router are connected with an ethernet cable.

Agent: Alright, let me have you try something. Can you check the ethernet cable connection between the modem and the router? Just make sure it's firmly plugged in on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it. The cable looks like it's plugged in pretty tight. Let me... (pause) actually, let me unplug it and plug it back in to be sure. (pause) Okay, it's back in. Still the same though. Internet light is still red.

Agent: Alright. Let me try one more thing. Can you tell me what lights are lit up on the router itself? Any green lights, red lights, anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, so the router has... the power light is green. And there's a light that says "internet" on it and that one is... that one's also not lit up at all, actually. It's completely off.

Agent: Okay, so the internet light on the router isn't lit up either. That tells me the router isn't getting a signal from the modem. Let me have you try restarting the router now. Go ahead and unplug that.

Customer: (pause) Unplugging it... (pause) Okay. Should I wait thirty seconds again?

Agent: Yeah, same thing. Thirty seconds should do it.

Customer: (pause) Alright, waiting... (pause) and plugging it back in. (pause) Let's see... (pause) Power light's coming on... (pause) but nope. Internet light on the router is still off. And I can see the modem still has that red light on the internet port.

Agent: Alright, I'm thinking there might be an issue with the modem itself then. How long has it been since you've power cycled it, or has anything changed with your setup recently?

Customer: (pause) Not really. I mean, it's been running fine until today. I haven't changed anything. No power outages or anything like that.

Agent: Okay. Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds, pause) Alright, so looking at your account, I'm not seeing any issues flagged on the line itself. The signal is coming through on our end. Let me try pinging your modem to see if it's responding... (pause, typing sounds) Hmm. The modem isn't responding to my ping. That's... that's actually unusual.

Customer: Is that bad?

Agent: Well, it could mean a few things. It could be that the modem isn't properly provisioning on our network, or there could be an issue with the modem's connection to our backend system. Let me try to factory reset the modem. This will clear all the settings, but it should re-provision it on our network. Are you comfortable with that?

Customer: I mean, if you think that'll help, sure. What do I need to do?

Agent: Okay, so on the modem, there should be a small recessed button labeled "Reset." It usually requires a paperclip or a small tool to press it. You'll need to hold it down for about ten to fifteen seconds. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's really small. (pause) I'm grabbing a paperclip. (pause) Okay, I'm pressing it... holding it... (pause) Okay, I'm at about fifteen seconds. Should I release it?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and release it. Now the modem is going to restart and it's going to take a few minutes to fully reset and re-provision.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing the lights flashing now. Looks like it's booting up.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and give it about three to five minutes to fully boot up and provision. While we wait, let me just verify your address and billing information to make sure everything's on file.

Customer: Uh, sure. (pause) Um, what do you need?

Agent: Can you confirm your service address for me?

Customer: Yeah, it's 2847 North 48th Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85008.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, that matches what I have on file. Okay, and it looks like your account is in good standing. (pause) So we're gonna give this a minute or two more. Sometimes these resets take a little longer than expected. Can you tell me what you're seeing on the modem now?

Customer: (pause) The lights are still flashing. The power light's kind of steady green, but the internet light is still blinking or flashing. I'm not really sure what that means.

Agent: Okay, blinking usually means it's still trying to establish a connection. That's actually a good sign. Let's give it one more minute.

(pause)

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... the internet light is still blinking. It's been like, a couple of minutes now.

Agent: Alright, let me check this from my end. (typing sounds, pause) Hmm. (pause) James, I'm still not seeing the modem coming back online on our system. Normally after a factory reset, it should re-provision within a couple of minutes. The fact that it's not responding tells me there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself.

Customer: Oh, man. So what does that mean? Does the modem need to be replaced?

Agent: That's likely what we're looking at here. Unfortunately, the troubleshooting steps we've done aren't bringing the modem back online, and I'm not seeing any issues on our network side. Before I proceed though, let me try one more thing. Let me see if I can manually provision the modem from my system. (typing sounds, pause, more typing) Okay, sending that now... (pause) Let me give that a moment to process... (pause, typing sounds) No, it's still not responding. I'm not getting any acknowledgment from the device.

Customer: Okay, so what do I do? Like, I need internet. I have work calls this afternoon.

Agent: I completely understand. Here's what I'd recommend. We can get a replacement modem sent out to you. Normally that takes three to five business days, but given that you're without service, let me see what I can expedite for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up our shipping options now. (pause, typing sounds) I can get a replacement modem sent to you via overnight shipping at no additional charge. You should receive it by tomorrow morning. In the meantime, is there anything else I can try to get your current modem working?

Customer: Um, I don't know. I feel like we've tried everything at this point. The factory reset didn't work, right?

Agent: Right, unfortunately it didn't. At this point, without the modem communicating with our network, there's really not much else I can do from a troubleshooting perspective. The hardware itself isn't responding, which indicates a failure on the modem's end, not the network.

Customer: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. So what's the process for the replacement? Do I have to do anything?

Agent: Okay, so the replacement modem will arrive tomorrow. When you get it, the setup is straightforward. Just unplug your current modem, plug in the new one, and it should provision automatically within a few minutes. You shouldn't need to do anything else. Once it's set up and working, you can send the old modem back to us using the prepaid shipping label that will be included in the box.

Customer: Okay, that sounds... well, not great, but at least I'll have internet back tomorrow. Can you tell me what time it might arrive? I need to make sure I'm home.

Agent: The overnight shipping window is typically between 8 AM and 5 PM, but it could arrive anytime within that window. I'd recommend being available throughout the day if possible. I'm going to note on your account that you need to be home to receive it.

Customer: Alright. And there's no charge for the overnight shipping?

Agent: No charge at all. Since this is a equipment failure and you're without service, we're covering that cost.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. So I should expect it tomorrow sometime?

Agent: Yes, you should see it by tomorrow. I'm going to send you a confirmation email right now with the tracking information and a reference number for this call. The email should arrive within the next few minutes to the email address we have on file. Do you want me to verify that email address?

Customer: Sure, it's james.rodriguez.2847 at... gmail.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, sending that now. James, I want to apologize for the inconvenience here. I know this isn't ideal, especially when you have work stuff going on.

Customer: Yeah, well, I appreciate you trying to troubleshoot it. I mean, we did everything we could, right? Just one of those things, I guess.

Agent: Exactly. And again, you should have your replacement modem tomorrow. Once you get it set up and your internet is back up and running, if you have any issues with the new modem, you can always give us a call back and we'll be happy to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just hoping the modem shows up tomorrow like you said.

Agent: I'm confident it will. Thank you for being patient with us, James, and I apologize again for the service interruption. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
