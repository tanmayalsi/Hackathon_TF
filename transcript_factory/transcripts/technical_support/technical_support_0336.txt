# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Just to confirm, you're experiencing a complete internet outage, correct? No connection at all?

Customer: Right, nothing. Like, my router won't even power on properly. Well, actually, it powers on but all the lights are just... I don't know, they're flickering weird.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Flickering lights could indicate a few things. Let me walk you through some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what model router you have? It should be printed on the back or bottom.

Customer: (pause) Let me grab it. (rustling sounds) Uh, it says... Frontier... Model FX-2000.

Agent: Great, the FX-2000. Okay, so here's what I want you to do. Can you locate the power cable going into the router?

Customer: Yeah, I can see it.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and unplug it from the wall outlet—not from the router itself, but from the wall. And then wait about 30 seconds before plugging it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just... let's give it a full 30 seconds. (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (rustling, slight beep in background) Okay, it's plugged back in now. So I'm waiting for it to boot up?

Agent: Exactly. It should take about two to three minutes to fully power back on. You should see the lights come on in sequence. The power light first, then the internet light should turn solid blue.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) So far just the power light is on. It's like amber or yellow or something.

Agent: That's normal. Give it another minute or so. While we wait, let me ask—has anything changed with your setup recently? Any storms in your area, or any electrical issues?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Actually, wait—I did have a power flicker this morning. Like, the lights went out for a second. But I thought everything was fine after that.

Agent: That could definitely be it. Sometimes those brief power interruptions can affect the modem. (pause) How are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Uh, the internet light is starting to come on but it's still kind of orange. Not blue yet.

Agent: Okay, still booting up. That's fine. (pause) Let me check something on your account here. (typing sounds) So I'm not showing any outages in your area, which is a good sign. That means it's likely an equipment issue.

Customer: Okay, so...?

Agent: So we're still waiting for the router to fully boot. It can take a few minutes sometimes. Have you noticed any unusual sounds coming from the device? Any burning smell or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's just... the lights keep flickering. (pause) Oh wait, okay, the internet light just turned solid blue. Is that good?

Agent: Excellent! That's exactly what we want to see. Now, do you have a computer or phone nearby that you can try connecting to?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my laptop right here.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and try connecting to your WiFi network. You should see the Frontier network in your available networks list.

Customer: (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I see it. Connecting now... (pause) Hmm, it's asking for the password. (pause) Okay, I'm typing it in. (pause) It says "connecting"... (pause) and... nope, it says "can't connect to this network." 

Agent: Alright, let's try a different approach. Can you try connecting with an ethernet cable if you have one available?

Customer: I... I might have one somewhere. Let me check. (pause) Yeah, I found one in a drawer. Give me a second. (rustling sounds, pause) Okay, I'm plugging it in now. (pause) So now what?

Agent: Good. Once you've got it plugged in, just open a web browser and try going to any website. Google.com is usually a good test.

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm typing in Google... (pause) It's loading... (pause) and... nope. It's saying the server can't be reached.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me check something. Can you look at the router again? The internet light should still be solid blue, right?

Customer: Yeah, it's still blue. And the power light is solid too.

Agent: (pause) Okay, David, I'm going to be honest with you—this is a bit unusual. Let me run a few diagnostics from my end. (typing sounds, pause) I'm going to put you on a very brief hold while I check the line status to your modem. This should only take about a minute.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: Thank you. (hold music plays, approximately 90 seconds)

Agent: Okay, David, I'm back. So I'm showing that your line is active and there's no issue detected on our end. However, given that your equipment went through that power interruption this morning, I'm wondering if the modem—not the router, but the actual modem that connects to our line—may have been affected.

Customer: So... is the modem separate from the router?

Agent: It can be, yes. Do you have another device, like maybe a separate box that connects directly to the wall outlet and then to the router?

Customer: (pause) I don't think so? I just have the one device that you guys provided.

Agent: That would be the all-in-one unit then. Okay. So here's what I'm thinking. That power surge from this morning might have damaged the internal modem component. I've run the diagnostics and I'm not getting a proper handshake on the line.

Customer: So like... it's broken?

Agent: It appears that way, unfortunately. I know this isn't what you want to hear. Let me see what options we have here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I can absolutely send a technician out to you. We have an opening tomorrow between 2 and 4 PM, or we could potentially get someone out on Thursday morning.

Customer: Tomorrow would be better. But... can't I just, I don't know, restart it again or something?

Agent: (pause) I understand the frustration. Let me try one more thing before we go down the replacement route. I'm going to power cycle the device one more time, but this time I want you to hold the reset button on the back for about 10 seconds. This will reset it to factory settings.

Customer: Reset button? (pause) Okay, hold on. (rustling sounds) Is it this little button here?

Agent: Yes, usually a recessed button. You might need a paperclip or something small to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found one. I'm pressing it now... (pause) How long do I hold it?

Agent: About 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause, beeping sounds) Okay, I'm holding... let go now?

Agent: Actually, give it another five seconds. (pause) Okay, you can let go now.

Customer: Done. (pause) So now what?

Agent: Now we let it reboot again. This will take about three to four minutes. It'll be like we're setting it up from scratch.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, I'm waiting. (pause) The lights are doing the same thing as before. Power, then starting to flicker...

Agent: That's normal for a reset. Take your time. I'll be right here.

Customer: (pause, approximately 3 minutes of silence with occasional background noise) Okay, the internet light is blue again. Should I try connecting?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and try the WiFi again.

Customer: (typing sounds, pause) I'm seeing the network... connecting... (pause) It's asking for the password again... (pause) Okay, typing it in... "Connecting"... (pause) and... no, still nothing. Same error message.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I'm sorry, David, but I think we're looking at a hardware failure here. The fact that it's not holding a connection even after the reset tells me the modem component is likely damaged from that power surge.

Customer: So you're saying I definitely need a replacement?

Agent: Yes, I'm afraid so. The good news is we can get a new unit to you quickly. Like I mentioned, I have availability tomorrow between 2 and 4 PM, or Thursday morning. A technician will come out, install the replacement equipment, and get you back online.

Customer: Is there a fee for this?

Agent: Let me check here... (typing sounds) Since this appears to be equipment failure and not something within your control, I'm not going to charge you for the service call or the replacement unit. That's covered under your service agreement.

Customer: Oh, okay. That's... that's good at least.

Agent: So let's get you scheduled for tomorrow then. Your appointment will be between 2 and 4 PM. You should receive a confirmation email and a text message within the next few minutes with those details.

Customer: Alright. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home to let the technician in. They'll take care of everything else. Oh, and if you could have the old equipment ready for them, that would be helpful—they might take it with them.

Customer: Got it. Anything else I should know?

Agent: Just that I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. Unfortunately, power surges can be really hard on electronics, and there's not always much we can do to prevent damage. But we'll get you taken care of tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, thanks for trying at least. I appreciate it.

Agent: Of course, David. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
