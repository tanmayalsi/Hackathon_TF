Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I've got work I need to do from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot that. Let me just pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this for the service address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing a complete outage right now? The internet is totally down?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. I tried unplugging the modem and router this morning, waited like ten minutes, plugged it back in, and nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting step there. So the modem and router are both powered back on now?

Customer: Yeah, they're on. The lights are on and everything, but I'm not getting any internet.

Agent: Alright, let me ask you this — on the modem, what color are the lights? Are they all lit up, or is there one that's... maybe not doing what it should be?

Customer: Um, so there's a power light that's solid green. Then there's like a... I think it's labeled "Internet"? That one's not lit up at all. It's just off.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. The Internet light being off usually indicates there's a connection issue coming from our side or with your line. Have you had any recent weather? Any storms in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been pretty clear all morning.

Agent: Alright. And you haven't had any recent construction work or anything done near your home?

Customer: Not that I know of, no.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let me try a couple more things here. I'm going to have you do a hard reset on the modem. Can you locate the reset button? It's usually a small button on the back of the modem.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's like a tiny button, right? There's a little hole?

Agent: That's the one. Go ahead and hold it down for about ten to fifteen seconds. You should see all the lights go off and then they'll restart. Just give it a moment.

Customer: (background noise of modem beeping) Okay, yeah, I'm holding it... (pause) Alright, the lights are going through their startup sequence now.

Agent: Perfect. Just give it about two to three minutes to fully boot back up. Sometimes these things take a little time to reestablish connection.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been a couple minutes. Still just showing that power light. The Internet light is still off.

Agent: Hmm. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me the model of modem you're using?

Customer: Um... (pause) I'm looking at it right now. It says... Technicolor TG789... something. TG789bvn, I think?

Agent: Got it. And that's the equipment we provided when you set up your service?

Customer: Yeah, I believe so, yeah.

Agent: Okay. Let me... let me just check our network status here and see if there are any outages reported in your area. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any major outages flagged, but that doesn't mean there isn't an issue with your specific line. 

What I'd like to do is send a test signal down your line. Can you give that a moment? Just watch the modem and let me know if anything changes.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...nothing's changing. Still the same.

Agent: Yeah, I'm not getting a successful response back. That tells me there might be an issue with the line itself coming into your home, or possibly the modem has experienced a hardware failure. 

I think what we're going to need to do here is get a technician out to your place to physically inspect the line and potentially replace the modem. How does your schedule look for tomorrow or the day after?

Customer: Tomorrow would be great, honestly. I need this working ASAP.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so we have a couple windows open tomorrow. We have a morning window between 8 a.m. and noon, or an afternoon window between 1 and 5 p.m.

Customer: The afternoon window would work better for me. One to five?

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, you're all set for tomorrow between 1 and 5 p.m. The technician will come out, and they'll be able to diagnose what's going on. In most cases with this kind of issue, it's either the line or the equipment, and they can handle both.

Customer: Okay, great. And just... is there anything I can try in the meantime? I really need to work today if at all possible.

Agent: (pause) That's a tough one. Um... I hate to say it, but given that the Internet light isn't coming on at all, it's usually a pretty clear sign that there's something on our end or with the modem itself. You could try... I guess you could try a different power outlet, just to rule that out?

Customer: Yeah, I can try that.

Agent: Give that a shot and see if anything changes. But honestly, I think the technician visit is going to be your best bet. I wish I had better news for you today.

Customer: Yeah, no, I understand. Thanks for trying. So I've got tomorrow, 1 to 5 p.m.?

Agent: That's correct. And just so you have it for reference, your confirmation number is 847293. You can reference that if you need to call back or if the technician asks for it.

Customer: 847293. Got it.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm sorry you're experiencing this issue. We'll get you taken care of tomorrow. Thanks for calling Frontier.

Customer: Alright, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
