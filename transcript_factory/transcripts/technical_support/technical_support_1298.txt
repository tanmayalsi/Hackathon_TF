Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls scheduled this afternoon.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. Account for Michael Chen at 2847 Riverside Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Just to clarify, is your modem powered on right now?

Customer: Yes, it is. The lights are on and everything, but I'm not getting any internet. I've tried resetting it a couple times already, actually.

Agent: Okay, that's good troubleshooting on your part. Which lights are you seeing? Can you describe what's lit up for me?

Customer: Uh, let me look here... I see the power light, that's green. The internet light is... it's orange, I think? Or red maybe? It's definitely not green.

Agent: Alright, so that orange or red light is telling us there's an issue with your connection. That's what we need to fix. Have you checked if all your cables are plugged in securely? Sometimes they can come loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me check... (rustling sounds) Okay, I'm looking at the back here. Everything looks pretty tight to me. I don't see anything loose.

Agent: Great. And just to be thorough—do you have any other devices that might be connected to your modem? Like a router or anything?

Customer: Oh, yeah. I have a separate WiFi router that's connected to the modem.

Agent: Okay, is the router powered on as well?

Customer: Yes, it's on. But it's not showing any internet either.

Agent: That makes sense because it's getting its connection from the modem. So here's what I'd like you to do for me. I want you to unplug your modem—that's the Frontier equipment—and wait about 30 seconds. Just count it out or look at your phone.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now... (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. While we wait, can you tell me if you've experienced any service issues in the past week or so?

Customer: No, nothing like this. It was working fine last night. I woke up this morning and it just wasn't working.

Agent: Understood. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's plugged back in. I see the lights coming back on.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about a minute for it to fully boot back up. This gives the modem time to reestablish its connection.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been about a minute. The power light is green still, but that other light is still orange or red. It hasn't changed.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check on our end to see if we're seeing any issues with your service. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your modem right now... (pause) I'm showing that we're not detecting a signal on our line. That's unusual. Let me check for any outages in your area.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages on Riverside Drive. Have you noticed any storms or anything in your area recently? Sometimes that can affect the line.

Customer: No, the weather's been fine. It's been sunny all day.

Agent: Alright. Let me try one more thing. There's a reset button on the back of your modem. It's usually recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something thin to press it. Do you have that?

Customer: Yeah, I think I have a paperclip. (rustling) Here we go... where is that button? Is it near the power?

Agent: It should be on the back panel, sometimes labeled "Reset." You might need to look closely.

Customer: (pause) Found it, I think. It's a tiny button next to what looks like a... I don't know, a phone jack?

Agent: That could be it. What I want you to do is press and hold that button for about 10 seconds. This will reset your modem to factory settings, so fair warning—you might need to reconnect your WiFi devices afterward.

Customer: Okay... (pause, holding sounds) Alright, I'm holding it... and... releasing. The lights are flashing now.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give it another minute to restart completely.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been restarting for a bit. The lights are still doing the same thing though. The internet light is still not green.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I'm still not seeing any signal coming from our end. I'm going to be honest with you—this is pointing to either an issue with the line itself coming to your house, or there might be something wrong with the modem hardware.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, the modem might need to be replaced. But before we go down that route, I'd like to get a technician out to your location to check the line and make sure that's not the issue. If it's the modem, we can get you a replacement pretty quickly.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet today if possible.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... We have appointments available tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we could potentially do Thursday morning. But today is pretty booked up, unfortunately.

Customer: Ugh. Okay, I guess tomorrow works. But I really need this fixed.

Agent: I understand, and I'm going to get you scheduled for tomorrow. In the meantime, is there a landline or mobile number you could use for those work calls this afternoon?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my cell phone. It's not ideal, but I guess I can use that.

Agent: I know it's not the same, but that should help you get through until we can get this resolved. Let me get you scheduled here... (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you down for tomorrow, Tuesday, between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will come by and diagnose the issue. If it's the modem, we can usually replace it on the spot.

Customer: Alright. Do I need to be home the whole time?

Agent: Yes, we'll need someone there to let the technician in. They'll give you a window, but it's good to have someone available for that whole block.

Customer: Got it. Is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: Honestly, I'd probably just leave the modem off until the technician gets there. Since the reset didn't help, any additional troubleshooting is likely not going to make a difference. We want to have the modem in a fresh state when the tech arrives anyway.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense.

Agent: Let me just confirm your contact information here. What's the best number to reach you at to confirm the appointment tomorrow?

Customer: 555-0147, that's the same number I gave you.

Agent: Perfect. We'll also send you an email confirmation to whatever address we have on file. You should get that shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm just hoping this gets fixed quickly.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll get a technician out there tomorrow, and hopefully we'll have you back up and running right away. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and I apologize again for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.
