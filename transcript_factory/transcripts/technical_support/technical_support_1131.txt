# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I work from home and I'm kinda in a bind here.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I definitely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. Account for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember roughly what time that happened?

Customer: Um... I'd say around 7 or 8 AM? I got up and tried to log in for work and nothing was connecting.

Agent: Okay, and have you done any troubleshooting on your end yet, or is this the first time you're calling in?

Customer: Well, I tried unplugging the modem and router, waited a few minutes, and plugged them back in. That's about it. That usually works, but this time it didn't.

Agent: Yeah, that's actually a good first step, so I appreciate you trying that. Alright, let me ask you a few questions. When you look at your modem right now, are there any lights on the front of it?

Customer: Um, hold on... (pause) Okay, so I see... there's a power light, it's green. But the internet light is red. Is that bad?

Agent: That red light actually does indicate an issue. The internet light should be solid green or at least blue if the connection is active. Okay, and what about your router? What lights do you see on that?

Customer: The router has... it's all dark. Nothing's lit up on it.

Agent: Okay, so the router isn't powering on. Did you check to make sure the power cable is plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it is. I can see it's plugged into the outlet and into the back of the router.

Agent: Alright. Try this for me—unplug the power cable from the router, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. Let me know when you've done that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Thirty seconds... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. What do you see happening now?

Customer: Um... now I see a light coming on. There's an orange light on the front.

Agent: Okay, that's progress. The orange light usually means it's starting up. Give it about another minute or two to fully boot up. In the meantime, let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) Do you know if there have been any outages reported in your area recently?

Customer: No, I... I mean, I haven't heard anything about that. Is that something that might be happening?

Agent: It's possible. We do occasionally have maintenance or outages in certain areas. I'm checking our system now. (pause) What's the status of that router light now?

Customer: It's still orange. Actually, wait—now I'm seeing some green mixed in? There's green and orange kind of flickering.

Agent: Okay, that's actually normal during the boot-up process. Once it fully initializes, you should see it go solid green on the internet light. While we wait for that, let me check our outage map. (typing sounds) I'm not showing any active outages in your area at the moment, so that's good news.

Customer: So what does that mean? That it's just my equipment?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It might be your equipment, or it could be something on our end with your line specifically. Let's give that router another minute to fully come up, and then we'll do a quick test.

Customer: (pause) Okay...

Agent: How's that light looking now?

Customer: Um, it's still... it's still orange and green. It's not going solid.

Agent: Okay, I see. So it's been a couple minutes now and it should have fully booted by now. Let me try something else. I'm going to do a restart on your modem from our end. This might take a minute or two. You might see some lights flicker.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Oh, I see some stuff changing now. (pause) Nope, still not... yeah, it's still not solid.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I initiated that restart. Let me check the status here... (pause) Hmm, I'm seeing the modem is having trouble establishing a connection to our network. I'm wondering if there might be a line issue on our end. 

Customer: What does that mean? Can you fix that?

Agent: Potentially, yes. Let me ask you a couple more things. Have there been any storms in your area recently? Or any construction work near your house?

Customer: No storms, but actually, now that you mention it... there were some utility workers doing work on the telephone poles in my neighborhood yesterday. Could that have something to do with it?

Agent: It's absolutely possible. If they were working on the lines, they may have accidentally disconnected or loosened something. That would definitely cause what we're seeing. What I'd like to do is escalate this to our technical team so they can send someone out to check the line connection at the pole. They'd need to do a physical inspection. Would you be available for a technician visit?

Customer: When would they be able to come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. If I schedule this today, we could potentially get someone out to you... it looks like we have availability tomorrow between 2 PM and 4 PM, or the day after that in the morning around 9 to 11 AM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Ugh, I... I really need this fixed today. I have a presentation this afternoon at 3 PM.

Agent: I completely understand, and I wish I had something sooner. Unfortunately, our next available slot is tomorrow afternoon. I know that's frustrating. Is there any chance you could use mobile hotspot for your presentation today?

Customer: I mean, my phone has unlimited data, but... the connection is usually not as reliable.

Agent: I know it's not ideal, and I'm really sorry about this. Let me see if there's anything else I can try real quick before we schedule that technician visit. Let me restart the modem one more time and check the line signal strength.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Trying another restart now. (pause) Can you keep your eye on those lights for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, they're flickering again. (pause) Okay, now they're... no, still the same orange-green situation. I don't think anything's changing.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, I'm checking the signal coming into your modem, and it's... actually, the signal is really degraded. Way below what it should be. That pretty much confirms my suspicion about the line. There's definitely something wrong with the connection on our end, likely at the pole or in the underground line in your neighborhood.

Customer: So I need a technician to come out?

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately. This is beyond what I can troubleshoot remotely. The technician will be able to check the line physically and make sure everything is connected properly. They should be able to get you back up and running once they repair whatever was damaged.

Customer: (sigh) Okay. So... tomorrow afternoon?

Agent: Let me get that scheduled for you. Actually, let me try to see if I can get you on the morning slot instead, which might be better. Let me check that again. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I can book you for tomorrow, June 14th, between 9 and 11 AM. How does that sound?

Customer: Yeah, tomorrow morning is better than the afternoon. That'll work.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you now. A technician will come to your address at 428 Maple Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. And we'll send you a confirmation text and email with all the details. The technician can access the lines, so you don't necessarily need to be home, but just in case they need to access your equipment, it would be helpful if someone's there or available by phone.

Customer: Okay, I'll be here. (pause) So what am I supposed to do for internet today?

Agent: Unfortunately, until the technician comes out tomorrow, you're probably not going to be able to use your Frontier connection. As I mentioned, mobile hotspot would be your best bet for today. I wish there was more I could do to help you remotely. I know this isn't the outcome you were hoping for.

Customer: Yeah, I mean... I get it. It's frustrating, but I appreciate you trying. So I should see the confirmation sometime soon?

Agent: You should receive it within the next few minutes. If for some reason you don't get it, you can always call back and we can make sure you have all the details. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Robert?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. We'll get you taken care of tomorrow morning. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
