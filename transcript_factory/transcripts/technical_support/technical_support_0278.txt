# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. Can I have your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, sure. It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. And what's your name?

Customer: It's Mike. Mike Patterson.

Agent: Great, Mike. I've got your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago. I was working from home and everything just... stopped. I've rebooted the router already but nothing's changed.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. So you've already rebooted the router—that's great. When you say it went out, are you seeing any lights on the modem or router at all?

Customer: Um, let me go look at it. (pause) Yeah, okay, I'm looking at it now. The modem has... it looks like there's a red light on it. The router next to it doesn't have any lights on at all.

Agent: Okay, a red light on the modem—that usually indicates a connection issue. The router being dark is concerning though. Can you tell me what kind of router you have? Is it the one we provided?

Customer: Yeah, it's the Frontier one. It's white, pretty standard looking.

Agent: Right, okay. And that one definitely has no lights at all? Not even a power light?

Customer: (pause) No, actually, wait. Let me look more closely. There's like a very faint light. Yeah, okay, there's a tiny green light in the corner, but it's really dim. That's not normal, is it?

Agent: It might be okay—sometimes they're just dim. But let's go ahead and do a hard reset on both devices. Can you unplug the modem first and wait about 30 seconds?

Customer: Sure, unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, 30 seconds... and done. Plugging it back in.

Agent: (typing sounds) Good. Now let's do the same with the router. Go ahead and unplug that one too.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Alright, unplugged.

Agent: Great. Wait about 30 seconds on that one as well, and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. So how long should it take to come back online?

Agent: It should take a few minutes. The modem will boot up first, then the router. Just give it about three to four minutes and see if you get some color back to those lights. While we wait, have you noticed any outages in your area, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, this is the first time. I haven't heard anything about outages. I mean, it's been pretty rainy today, but other than that...

Agent: Rainy weather can sometimes affect the signal, but it usually wouldn't cause a complete outage like this. Okay, so... how are those lights looking now? Any change?

Customer: (pause) Um, the modem light is still red, and the router light is... actually it looks a little brighter than before, but I'm still not getting internet. My phone isn't connecting to the WiFi network.

Agent: Okay, the WiFi network isn't showing up at all, or is it showing up but not connecting?

Customer: I don't see it at all. It's not appearing.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else. Can you check the back of the modem for me? I want to make sure all the cables are firmly connected.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the back. There's a cable coming from the wall, and then there's... I think two cables going out to the router?

Agent: Yes, there should be one going to the router and one that might be a power cable or secondary connection. Can you gently wiggle each of those cables and make sure they're pushed in tight?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm... okay, I think I found one that was a little loose. Let me push that in. (pause) Okay, I think that's tighter now. Should I... do I need to restart them again?

Agent: Good catch. Yeah, let's restart the modem one more time. Go ahead and unplug it.

Customer: Unplugging now. (pause) Done. (pause) Okay, plugging back in.

Agent: (pause) Let's give it a couple minutes this time. While we're waiting, Mike, have you had any recent storms or anything that might have affected your connection?

Customer: Not really, no. It was just raining earlier, like I said. Nothing crazy.

Agent: Right. Okay, so... let's check in. How are we looking with those lights?

Customer: (pause) The modem light is still red. And the router... okay, the router is looking a little better. It's got some lights now, but I'm checking my phone and I still don't see the WiFi network.

Agent: Hmm, that's frustrating. The router having some lights is a good sign, but if the network isn't broadcasting, there might be a deeper issue. Let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) 

Can you tell me what the model number of the router is? It should be on a sticker somewhere on the device.

Customer: Um, yeah, let me look. (pause) I see... FR-9-6-7? I think. Is that right?

Agent: (pause) Okay, I have that. And on the modem, can you read me the model?

Customer: (pause) The modem is... FI-G-8-5-0-0. 

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. Okay, Mike, I'm looking at what you're telling me and I'm seeing... actually, let me put you on a very brief hold while I check something with my supervisor. This should just be about 30 seconds.

Customer: Sure, okay.

Agent: (hold music plays, then ends) Okay, thanks for holding. Mike, I'm back. So, I'm going to have you try one more thing. On the modem, there should be a small reset button. It's usually in a recessed hole on the back. Do you see that?

Customer: There's... yeah, there's a little hole here. Is that it?

Agent: That's the one. Now, I want you to take a paperclip or something small and press it for about 10 seconds. This is going to reset the modem completely, so just be prepared for that.

Customer: Okay, pressing it now. (pause) How long?

Agent: Hold it for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I think that's about 10. Releasing it now.

Agent: Good. This is going to take a few minutes to fully reset. Let's give it about five minutes this time.

Customer: (pause, then several minutes of silence) Alright, it's been a few minutes. The modem light is... okay, it's still red. (pause) And I still don't see the WiFi network on my phone.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Mike, I'm not seeing any outages in your area in our system, which is good news. But given that the modem light is staying red and the WiFi network isn't broadcasting, I think there might be a hardware issue with one of the devices. (pause) Have you had any power surges or anything unusual happen before the internet went out?

Customer: No, nothing that I saw. Like I said, it was just... working, and then it wasn't.

Agent: I understand. Unfortunately, based on what we've tried, I think we're going to need to get a technician out to your location to diagnose this. The red light on the modem is typically an indicator that there's a signal issue or a hardware problem that I can't troubleshoot over the phone.

Customer: Really? How long would that take? I'm working from home and I really need this fixed.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check what appointments we have available. (typing sounds) We have a technician available... tomorrow morning between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have another slot on Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Unfortunately, those are the soonest we have available right now.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, I guess tomorrow morning works. Can they definitely fix it?

Agent: The technician will be able to diagnose the issue and either repair or replace the equipment if needed. Assuming it's a hardware issue, which it appears to be, yes, they should be able to get you back online.

Customer: Alright. Tomorrow morning then. What do I need to do?

Agent: Great. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. Can you confirm the service address on file is still 447 Maple Street, Apartment 3B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. Your appointment is confirmed for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. You'll receive a confirmation text and email shortly. The technician will bring all necessary equipment. In the meantime, just leave everything unplugged so we can do a fresh start when they arrive.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. And just to confirm, there shouldn't be a charge for this, right? Since it's your equipment?

Agent: That's correct. Since this is an issue with our equipment, there won't be a service charge. Do you have any other questions for me?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying to fix it anyway.

Agent: Of course, Mike. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone, but the technician will take great care of you tomorrow. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Take care!
