Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I've already restarted my router like three times. I work from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm looking at your account for... Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem at all? Like, is it powered on?

Customer: Oh, yeah, the modem is on. I see the lights blinking, but like... they're all red. Or maybe orange? I'm not really sure what they're supposed to be.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Red or orange lights typically indicate there's a connection issue. Let me walk you through a few quick troubleshooting steps. First, can you unplug the modem and the router? Just pull the power cables out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, doing that now. Both unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. While we wait, let me ask—have you noticed any recent storms in your area? Or any changes to your setup?

Customer: No storms, but actually... oh, I did move my router yesterday. I moved it to the other side of the living room because it was in the way.

Agent: Ah, okay. That could potentially be related, though usually that wouldn't cause a complete outage. But we'll keep that in mind. Go ahead and wait about thirty seconds for everything to fully power down.

Customer: (background noise of waiting) Alright, it's been about thirty seconds.

Agent: Great. Now go ahead and plug the modem back in first. Just the modem.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Okay, it's plugged in.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait for it to fully boot up. You should see some lights start to come on. Can you tell me when you start seeing lights?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, I'm seeing lights now. They're... they're still red though. Or orange. Still that color.

Agent: Hmm. Are you seeing any green lights at all?

Customer: No, just... all the same color. It's like a steady glow now instead of blinking.

Agent: Okay, that's not what we want to see. Let me try something else. Can you unplug the modem again, and this time wait a full minute? Sometimes if there's been a prolonged outage, the modem needs a longer reset.

Customer: A full minute? Really?

Agent: Yeah, I know it seems like a lot, but it can help clear things out. Go ahead and pull that power cable.

Customer: (unplugging) Okay, unplugged. I'll just... wait here.

Agent: While we're waiting, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your service status in your area. (pause) I'm not seeing any known outages reported in your neighborhood right now, which is good news in one way, but...

Customer: But what?

Agent: Well, it means the issue is likely specific to your equipment or your line. Can you tell me... do you have a battery backup unit on your modem? Sometimes they're called UPS units?

Customer: I... I don't think so? I mean, I just have the modem and the router that you guys sent me.

Agent: That's fine, that's fine. How long have you had those devices?

Customer: Um... probably like two years? Maybe a little longer?

Agent: Okay, and this is the first time you've had an issue like this?

Customer: Yeah, first time in a while anyway.

Agent: Alright. Let me check your account notes. (typing sounds) I see you did have a technician out about... fourteen months ago. That was for a different issue though. Okay, it should be about a minute now. Go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Good. Let's see what happens.

Customer: (pause) Okay, lights are coming on again, and... no, same thing. All red or orange. It's definitely not working.

Agent: (sigh) Alright. Let me try one more thing before we move forward. Can you check the cables coming into your modem? Is the cable from the wall—the coaxial cable—is it firmly connected?

Customer: (rustling sounds) Yeah, let me see. I'm looking at the back of the modem here. The cable looks... connected? I mean, it's screwed in pretty tight.

Agent: Okay, you could try unscrewing it and screwing it back in just to make sure it's got a good connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that. Unscrewing... okay, I'm screwing it back in. It's definitely tight now.

Agent: Did the lights change at all when you did that?

Customer: (pause) No. Nope, still the same. Still red.

Agent: (longer pause) Robert, I have to be honest with you. These lights—they're not responding the way they should to any of the resets. That typically indicates either a modem failure or an issue with the line itself. Let me check one more thing. Can you tell me if your phone service is working? Do you have phone service with us?

Customer: Yeah, I have the phone service, but actually I... I can't really tell if it's working. I haven't tried to use it.

Agent: Okay, can you pick up a phone and just see if you get a dial tone?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Sure, let me grab a phone. (pause) Um... yeah, I don't hear anything. The phone's dead.

Agent: Okay, that's actually important information. That tells me the issue is likely with the line coming into your house, not just the modem. The phone and internet both run through the same line.

Customer: Oh. So what does that mean?

Agent: It means we probably need to get a technician out to your location to do an on-site inspection. But before I schedule that, let me try just one more thing. Can you look at the modem? Is there any kind of reset button? Sometimes it's a small recessed button on the back.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Hold on, I'm looking at the back... I feel something here. It's like a tiny button?

Agent: Yes, that might be it. I'm going to have you hold that down for about ten seconds. This will do a factory reset, so it might take a few minutes for everything to come back online afterward.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... ten seconds, right?

Agent: Yep, ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, released it. Now what?

Agent: Now let's wait about two or three minutes and see if the lights change.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm watching it. (longer pause) Still the same though. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Robert, I think at this point we need to get a technician out there. The combination of no phone service and no internet service, plus the modem not responding to any of these resets... that indicates a line-level issue that I can't troubleshoot over the phone.

Customer: How long until someone can come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability. (pause) I can get someone scheduled for... we have same-day service available until 8 PM today, or we have tomorrow morning between 8 and 5. What works better for you?

Customer: I mean... today would be better, but what time can they actually be there?

Agent: (typing) The window would be between 2 and 5 PM today. I know it's not super specific, but that's our standard service window.

Customer: That should work. I'm home today anyway since my internet's down.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. Can I confirm your service address?

Customer: Yeah, it's 4521 Maple Drive, Apartment 2C.

Agent: (typing) 4521 Maple Drive, Apartment 2C. And a contact number?

Customer: 555-0147. Same as the account number.

Agent: Great. I've got you scheduled for today between 2 and 5 PM. A technician will come out and inspect the line and your equipment. If it's the modem that's failed, they'll bring a replacement. If it's a line issue, they'll work on getting that fixed.

Customer: Okay. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure you're home, and maybe write down if you notice any issues with the cable outside your apartment. But the technician will handle everything.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, I guess. I mean, thanks for trying to fix it.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it working remotely, Robert. But we'll have this taken care of today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully the technician can figure it out.

Agent: They will. Thanks for being patient with me today, and thanks for being a Frontier customer. You should receive a confirmation email shortly, and you'll also get an automated call about thirty minutes before the technician arrives. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
