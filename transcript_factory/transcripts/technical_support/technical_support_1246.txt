# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out about an hour ago, and I've been trying to figure this out on my own, but nothing's working. I really need to get back online.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got it. And what's the best name to have on this account?

Customer: It's James. James Whitmore.

Agent: Great, James. Thanks for that. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Just to clarify, is your modem powered on right now? Can you see any lights on it?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's on. I can see... there's a green light, but then there's like a red light blinking on another one. I think it's the internet light or something?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So if you're seeing a red blinking light on the internet port, that typically means the modem isn't connecting to our network. Let's try a quick restart first. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Yeah, okay, one second... (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now I'm going to have you wait about 30 seconds while that power drains completely. Just give it a little time...

Customer: Okay. (pause) So while we're waiting, is this something that's like... happening in my area? Because my neighbor mentioned his was acting up yesterday too.

Agent: That's a good question. Let me check on that for you. (typing sounds) Looking at our service map here, I don't see any outages reported in your area at the moment, but I appreciate you mentioning that. Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, it's in.

Agent: Good. Now just give it about two minutes to fully boot back up. You should see the lights cycle through a few different colors before they stabilize.

Customer: (background noise of customer moving around) Yeah, I'm watching it now. The green light is back on the top one, and... the red light is still blinking on that other port.

Agent: Still blinking, huh? Okay, that's not quite what we want to see. What I'd like to do is check the connection on the line itself. Can you look at the coaxial cable—that's the cable that goes from the wall into the modem? It should have a threaded connector on it.

Customer: The thick cable?

Agent: Exactly, the thick cable. Can you make sure it's screwed in tight? Just give it a gentle tug to see if it's loose.

Customer: (pause) Oh... huh. Okay, so it was a little loose, so I tightened it up. Let me see if that... (pause) No, still the same red light blinking.

Agent: Alright, no change there. Let me ask you this—have you experienced any recent storms in your area, or has anything changed with your setup recently?

Customer: No storms that I know of. But, um, actually now that you mention it, the cable guy was here last week doing some work on the line outside. I don't know if that's related.

Agent: Oh, that could definitely be relevant. Do you happen to know what kind of work they were doing?

Customer: I think he said something about upgrading the... the node? I'm not really sure, to be honest. He was out there for a while though.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that could be it. It's possible the external line wasn't properly reconnected after the upgrade. What I'm going to do is cycle the modem remotely from my end. This will take about five to ten minutes, so your internet is going to go down completely for a moment and then restart.

Customer: Okay, just... just do whatever you need to do.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I'm initiating that now... (pause) It should take about a minute. Just keep watching those lights for me.

Customer: (background noise) (long pause) Okay, so it's like... doing something. The lights are going a little crazy right now.

Agent: That's normal. It's rebooting. (pause) Just a couple more seconds here...

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's settled down now. But... (pause) I'm still seeing that red blinking light on the internet port.

Agent: (pause) Still blinking?

Customer: Yeah, unfortunately.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Alright, let me try one more thing here. I want to check something on the backend. (typing sounds) (pause) James, I'm looking at the signal levels coming into your modem, and they're reading abnormally low. That's likely why the modem can't establish a connection to the network.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It typically means there's an issue with the line coming into your house. Given that the cable company was there last week doing work, it's very possible the connection wasn't secured properly or something got damaged during the installation. Unfortunately, that's not something I can fix remotely.

Customer: Oh no. So I need to call them back out?

Agent: Yes, I think we're going to need to schedule a technician visit. Since Frontier provides the fiber service, but your coaxial connection runs through the external infrastructure, we should be able to get someone out to check that line. Let me see what I can do for you here...

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. (typing sounds) (pause) Looking at our schedule, the earliest I can get someone out to your location would be tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sigh) I mean, it's not ideal, but... yeah, that works. Will they be able to fix it?

Agent: The technician will be able to inspect the line and make any necessary repairs. Based on what we're seeing here, it's most likely a connection issue, so that should be a quick fix once they're there. I'm going to document this call and make a note that you had recent external line work done.

Customer: Okay, okay. So is there anything else I can try in the meantime? Any other troubleshooting?

Agent: (pause) You know what, let me try one more thing. It's a long shot, but sometimes a factory reset can help. Do you want to try that?

Customer: I mean, sure, why not. What do I do?

Agent: There should be a small reset button on the back of the modem. You'll need to hold it down for about 10 seconds. That'll wipe all the settings and restore it to factory defaults. Fair warning though—if it doesn't work, you won't have internet for the call anymore, so we'll be disconnected.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let's skip that then. If I do that and it doesn't work, I'll be completely offline, right?

Agent: Exactly. And honestly, given what we're seeing with those signal levels, I don't think a reset is going to solve this. The issue is external.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate you trying though. So you said tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 5?

Agent: (typing sounds) That's correct. I'm scheduling you for tomorrow, [inaudible] day, between 2 and 5 PM. You should receive a confirmation text and email at the number and address on your account. A technician will be out to inspect the external line. I'm also going to flag this as a priority since it appears to be related to recent installation work.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I'll look for that. And there's really nothing I can do tonight?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. Once we get the external line issue resolved, your internet should come right back up. But until then, the modem won't be able to connect.

Customer: Alright. Well, I guess I'll just use my phone's hotspot for tonight. Not ideal, but... (sigh)

Agent: I'm really sorry about this, James. I know it's a hassle. Just to recap everything—you have a technician scheduled for tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 5 PM to inspect and repair the external coaxial line. You should receive confirmation shortly.

Customer: Yeah, I got it. Thanks for trying anyway, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure. And hey, hopefully this gets resolved tomorrow and you'll be back up and running. If you have any other questions before the technician arrives, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Thanks for calling Frontier, James. Have a good evening.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.
