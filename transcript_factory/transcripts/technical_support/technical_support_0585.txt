Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... hold on. (pause) It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I'm seeing your account for... is this Michael Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. So your internet service is down as of this morning. Have you tried restarting your equipment yet?

Customer: Um, no, actually. I wasn't sure if that would even help. Let me do that now. Where's my... (pause) Okay, I've got my router here.

Agent: Great. So what I need you to do is unplug the power cable from the back of the router—that's the device with the lights on it—and just leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. I'm gonna count... thirty seconds, right?

Agent: Yep, thirty seconds should do it. That'll give it a full reset.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. Just waiting. One... two... three... (pause) Okay, 30 seconds is up. Plugging it back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now once you plug it back in, it's going to take a minute or two to fully boot back up. You should see the lights start to come on.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see... okay, the power light just came on. And now there's a couple other lights. Um... there's like a blue one and... (pause) ...a red one that's blinking.

Agent: Okay, a blue light and a red blinking light. That red light—that typically indicates there's no internet connection signal coming from our network. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) Have you noticed any weather issues or outages in your area? Any storms last night or anything?

Customer: No, not really. It was pretty clear yesterday. This morning was fine too, and then sometime around... I think it was around 9 AM, everything just stopped working.

Agent: Okay. Let me pull up the network diagnostics for your address. (pause) (typing sounds) Hmm. I'm not seeing any active outages reported in your service area at the moment, which is good news. That means it's likely something with your equipment or line specifically.

Customer: Oh, okay. So what do we do?

Agent: Well, let's try a couple more things. Do you see a modem? That's typically a smaller box, might have different lights than the router.

Customer: Oh, yeah, there's a smaller box. That one's connected to the big one with a cable.

Agent: Right, exactly. Okay, let's reset that as well. Go ahead and unplug the modem—that's the smaller one—and leave it unplugged for 30 seconds too.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Thirty seconds... (pause) And... plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Now this one typically takes a bit longer to come back online. Give it about two minutes.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I'm watching it now. The lights are flickering... there we go, some of them are solid now. But I still see that red blinking light on the router.

Agent: Still a red light?

Customer: Yeah, it's still blinking red.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let me check your line status on our end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm seeing some issues with the signal coming to your address. The signal levels aren't optimal. Michael, can you check something for me? Can you go look at where your cable comes into your house from outside?

Customer: Uh, sure. Hold on. (background noise, footsteps) Okay, I'm looking at it. It's... it looks fine to me. I see the cable coming from the pole and it goes into the box on my house.

Agent: Right, that's normal. Do you see any visible damage? Any cuts, any water, anything that looks out of place?

Customer: (pause) No, it looks... pretty standard to me. It's been like this for months since we got Frontier installed.

Agent: Okay, that's good. Let me try something else. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem from here. This might take a couple minutes to process. Just keep everything plugged in and wait.

Customer: Okay, sure. (pause) How long should I wait?

Agent: Give it about three minutes. Go ahead and check back on the lights.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... the lights are still the same. The modem has like a solid green light now, but the router still has that red blinking light. Is that... is that bad?

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Actually, that red light is still concerning. Let me check our backend again. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm going to try something. Can you check if the cable connecting the modem to the router is fully plugged in on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it. It looks pretty tight. The one on the modem side is definitely in, and on the router side... yeah, it looks good.

Agent: Okay. (pause) And you're still not getting any internet? Like you can't connect to the Wi-Fi network or anything?

Customer: Right, the Wi-Fi network isn't even broadcasting. The router isn't connecting to anything.

Agent: Let me check one more thing. What model router do you have? It should say on the front or back of the device.

Customer: (pause) Let me see... it says... Frontier FXR-100, I think.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that model here. (pause) Michael, I'm going to be honest with you—I've tried several troubleshooting steps and typically by now we would have seen some improvement, but we're not. The fact that your modem is showing green but the router is still displaying that red light, and the signal issues I'm seeing on our end, this might be a hardware issue with either your router or there's a line problem we can't diagnose over the phone.

Customer: (pause) So... what does that mean? Like, what are we talking about here?

Agent: (pause) It means I think we need to send a technician out to your location to physically check your line and possibly replace your equipment. That would be our next step.

Customer: Oh, wow. How long would that take? I really need internet today for work.

Agent: (typing sounds) I understand, and I'm sorry about that. Let me check our tech schedule. (pause) The earliest I can get someone out there is... tomorrow between 9 AM and noon. We could also potentially get someone out Thursday morning if that works better for your schedule.

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow morning, I guess. That would be better than Thursday. But I mean, I'm without internet right now...

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize that we weren't able to resolve this over the phone. The technician tomorrow will definitely be able to get you back online. In the meantime, if you need to work, many people use their mobile hotspot or there might be a coffee shop or library nearby with Wi-Fi access.

Customer: Yeah, I guess I could do that. Okay, so you're scheduling a technician for tomorrow morning?

Agent: Yes, tomorrow, 9 AM to noon. I'm going to need to confirm your address for the technician. Can you confirm the address on file is 447 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And a contact number for when the technician arrives—is 555-0147 the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Great. I'll have that all set up. The technician should arrive sometime in that window tomorrow morning. You'll also receive a confirmation email within the next hour or so. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that's it. Thanks, Derek, I guess. I'm not thrilled, but... thanks for trying.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved today, Michael. I know it's inconvenient. Our technician is really good, and they'll have you back up and running. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to call back. Thank you for being a Frontier customer.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate it. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Thanks for calling.
