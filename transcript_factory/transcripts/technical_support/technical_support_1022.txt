Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went out completely. It's been down for like the past hour and I need to get it back up. I'm working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I have your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. The phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. Let me just... perfect. I'm looking at your account now. And you said your internet's been down for about an hour?

Customer: Yeah, roughly an hour. Maybe a little less. One minute it was working fine and then the next thing I know, nothing. The modem's all dark. Well, not all dark—there are no lights on it at all.

Agent: Okay, so the modem has no lights on it currently. That's actually a good starting point. First thing I'd like you to do is check if the modem is still plugged in. Sometimes these things get unplugged accidentally, or a breaker trips.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's plugged in. I can see the cable going into the wall.

Agent: Great. And do you have a power outlet nearby where you could try plugging it into a different spot? Just to rule out the outlet itself?

Customer: Um... let me see. (background noise of something moving) Yeah, I've got another one right here next to my desk.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and unplug it from where it is and move it over to that outlet.

Customer: (unplugging sounds) Okay, plugging it in now... (pause) ...nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, that's okay. Do me a favor—when you look at the back of the modem, do you see an orange button or a reset button?

Customer: Oh, yeah. There's like a little sunken button on the back here. Is that it?

Agent: That's the one. I need you to hold that down for about ten seconds. You might need something small like a paperclip to press it since it's recessed.

Customer: Got a pen. One second... (pause) ...okay, I'm holding it. (pause) How long?

Agent: About ten seconds total. Just give it another few seconds... and go ahead and release it.

Customer: Alright, released. (pause) ...still nothing. The lights aren't coming back on.

Agent: Okay, give it just a moment. Sometimes it takes about thirty seconds or so to fully boot back up. While we wait, let me ask—have you had any recent storms in your area? Power outages or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The power's been fine. Just the internet went out.

Agent: And you said the modem has no lights at all, right? Not even a power indicator?

Customer: Correct. Nothing. It's completely dark.

Agent: (pause) Alright, let me try something else here. I'm going to check our systems to see if there are any outages in your area. Hold on just one moment while I look that up. (typing sounds, pause)

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm not showing any outages in your neighborhood right now, so that's good news. But the fact that your modem isn't powering on at all... (pause) ...it's possible the power adapter itself has failed.

Customer: So like, the brick that plugs in?

Agent: Exactly. That's what we call it. Do you happen to have another power adapter anywhere? Maybe from an old modem or a similar device?

Customer: I don't think so. I mean, I could look, but I don't really have anything like that lying around.

Agent: No worries. Well, here's what I'd like to do. I can definitely get a replacement modem sent out to you. However, with our current shipments, I'm looking at about three to five business days for delivery. But I want to make sure that's actually what we're dealing with here first.

Customer: Three to five days? That's... that's not ideal. I work from home. I need internet to do my job.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see if there's anything else we can try. (pause) Can you describe the power adapter for me? Like, what color is it?

Customer: It's white. Pretty standard-looking, I guess. Says Frontier on the side.

Agent: Okay. And when you look at where it connects to the modem, do you see any visible damage? Any burn marks or melting?

Customer: (pause) No, it looks fine from what I can see. The cable looks okay too.

Agent: Alright. One more thing we can try—sometimes if there's an issue with the power supply itself, we can try a different outlet, but you already did that... (pause) Do you have access to any kind of uninterruptible power supply or a surge protector? Anything like that?

Customer: I have a power strip under my desk. Why?

Agent: Go ahead and plug the modem into that. Sometimes a power strip has a switch or a reset that can help. Just make sure the strip itself is turned on.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the switch is on. Let me... (unplugging and plugging sounds) ...okay, plugged in. (long pause) No, still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, I think the power adapter has failed on us. I don't see any other troubleshooting steps that would resolve this at this point.

Customer: So what does that mean? I'm just out of internet until the new modem shows up?

Agent: Well, technically, depending on your situation, there are a couple of options. Since you work from home and this is urgent, we could potentially expedite the replacement. Let me look at what we have available... (typing sounds, pause) I can get expedited shipping, which would be overnight or two-day delivery, but that would be at an additional cost. Or we have the standard shipping I mentioned.

Customer: How much is expedited?

Agent: (pause) Let me see here... that would be an additional $29.99 for overnight delivery, or $14.99 for two-day.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) So I have to pay extra because the modem died? That seems kind of... I don't know.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me see what I can do for you. (pause) Actually, you know what, let me get a supervisor involved real quick. They might have more options available to us. Can you stay on the line for just a minute?

Customer: Yeah, okay. I guess.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to put you on a brief hold. This should just take a second.

Customer: (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: (returning) Alright, thanks for your patience. I spoke with my supervisor, and what we can do is knock that expedited shipping cost down to half off. So it would be $9.99 for two-day delivery instead of the regular cost. How does that sound?

Customer: I guess that's better than nothing. But I'm still going to be without internet for two days.

Agent: I know, and I'm really sorry about that. If you need an alternative connection temporarily, sometimes your cell phone carrier offers mobile hotspot data that you might be able to use as a backup.

Customer: Yeah, I might try that. Alright, let's just go ahead with the two-day shipping.

Agent: Excellent. I'm going to process that replacement modem with expedited two-day shipping right now. (typing sounds) You should see this charge of $9.99 appear on your next bill, and the modem will be delivered by [inaudible]. You'll get a tracking number via email, probably within the next hour or so.

Customer: Okay. And when it gets here, I just... plug it in?

Agent: Exactly. It should be a straightforward plug-and-play setup. Your service should activate automatically once it's connected. If for any reason you run into issues once it arrives, just give us a call back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate it, Derek.

Agent: Of course. And again, I'm sorry you're dealing with this today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications. We appreciate your business, and we'll have you back online real soon.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
