Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got some work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got you here. It looks like you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So the internet's been down since this morning—do you remember around what time that happened?

Customer: Yeah, maybe around seven or eight? I tried turning the modem off and on, but nothing's worked so far.

Agent: Okay, so you've already done a restart—that's good. Um, let me ask you a few questions. Are you seeing any lights on the modem right now?

Customer: (pause) Let me go look at it. (background noise of footsteps) Okay, so... the power light is on, it's blue. But the internet light, I think it's red? Or maybe orange? I'm not great with these things.

Agent: That's helpful information. Red or orange usually means there's no connection. Can you tell me—is the modem in a central location, or is it, uh, tucked away somewhere?

Customer: It's just sitting on a shelf in my living room. There's nothing blocking it or anything.

Agent: Good. And do you remember if there was a storm last night or anything unusual happen before the internet went down?

Customer: No, it was fine yesterday. Clear skies. I don't think there was anything... oh, wait. Actually, I did have an electrician here yesterday doing some work in the basement. I don't know if that matters?

Agent: (typing sounds) It could potentially matter, yeah. They might have accidentally unplugged something or there could be a line issue. Let me check your account here real quick. (pause) Your service shows as active on our end, so it's not a billing issue. Let me have you try something for me. Can you unplug the modem from the power source?

Customer: Okay, yeah. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about 30 seconds. I know it seems like a long time but... (pause) ...the modem needs to fully power down. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (background noise) Alright, it's back in. The power light's coming back on. Now I'm just waiting for the internet light...

Agent: Take your time. Sometimes it takes a minute or two.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's still red. Still not working.

Agent: Hmm, still red. All right. Can you also check—on the back of the modem, do you see any cables that might be loose? The cable that connects to the wall outlet?

Customer: (background noise) Let me... okay, I'm looking at the back. There's one cable going to the wall, and then there's like, a coaxial cable? The thick one?

Agent: Right, the coaxial cable—that's the internet line coming from outside. Can you check if that's screwed in tight?

Customer: (pause) It looks pretty tight to me, but I'm not... I mean, I can try to tighten it a little more if you want?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and give it a gentle turn to the right. Don't force it, just snug it up.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I did that. (pause) But the light's still red.

Agent: Still red. Okay. Let me pull up some information on your account here. (typing sounds) I'm going to check if there have been any outages in your area or any issues reported.

Customer: Is there an outage? That would actually make me feel better. At least it wouldn't be my fault.

Agent: (pause) No, I'm not showing any outages right now. Service looks normal in your area. Um, I do see that your modem was last connected about 24 hours ago, so it was definitely working yesterday.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It could be the modem itself, it could be the line coming into your house, or potentially a connection issue on our network. Um, given that you had the electrician there yesterday, it's also possible something got jostled. Have you checked your ONT? That's the outdoor network terminal—it's usually a white or gray box mounted on the side of your house.

Customer: I, uh... I'm not really sure what that looks like or where it would be.

Agent: It's okay. It's basically a box, usually about this big (gestures) on your exterior wall. Sometimes it's mounted near where the cable enters the house. Do you want to go take a look?

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (background noise of footsteps, door opening) Um, okay, I'm looking around the side of the house... I don't see anything obvious. There's like a metal box, but that's probably the electrical panel. (pause) There's something up here near the roof line...

Agent: That could be it. Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Yeah, actually. There are some lights. Um, there's a green one and a red one.

Agent: Okay, the green light is good, but a red light on the ONT usually means there's a problem on the line or with the signal coming in from the network. That's actually pretty helpful information. What that tells me is the issue isn't with your modem—it's likely on the infrastructure side. That could be because of what the electrician did, or it could be something else.

Customer: So what do I do? Can you fix it?

Agent: That's a good question. Unfortunately, I can't fix that from here. What we're going to need to do is schedule a technician to come out and check the line. They can see if something was damaged or if there's something else going on. I can get someone out there for you, but the earliest availability I'm showing is... (typing sounds) ...tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't someone come out today? I really need this working today if possible.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check... (pause) (typing sounds) ...I'm not showing any same-day appointments available in your area, I'm sorry. It looks like we've got a pretty full schedule today. But I can put you down for tomorrow morning, and if something opens up, we can call you.

Customer: (sighs) I guess I don't have much choice. Yeah, okay, tomorrow morning. Between 8 and 12.

Agent: Great. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. Is this phone number the best number to reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: And you'll be home tomorrow morning?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. Your service call is scheduled for tomorrow, January 15th, between 8 AM and noon. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue with your line. You should receive a confirmation call or text shortly. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just hope they can fix it quickly.

Agent: I'm sure they will. I know how frustrating it is to be without internet. We'll get this taken care of for you. Thank you for calling Frontier, and sorry again for the inconvenience.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
