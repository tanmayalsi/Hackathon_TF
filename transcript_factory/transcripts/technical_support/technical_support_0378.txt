# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: (pause) Okay, James, I've got your account up here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Centerville area. So the internet's completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely. Like, nothing's working. My WiFi router isn't even lighting up properly. Well, actually, it's got some lights on it, but nothing's connecting to it.

Agent: Alright, let me walk you through a few things. First, can you tell me what you're seeing on the router right now? Are there any lights that are red, green, blinking?

Customer: Um, okay so there's a green light on the left side, but then the other ones are kind of... they're not really doing anything. They're dim or off or something.

Agent: Okay, and what model router do you have? There should be a sticker on the back or the bottom.

Customer: (pause, sounds of movement) Yeah, it says... uh... it's a Quantum Gateway 5G. Is that what you need?

Agent: Yes, perfect. That's our standard unit. Alright, so here's what I want you to do. Let's do a power cycle first. Can you unplug the router from the power outlet?

Customer: Yep. (sounds of unplugging) Done.

Agent: Great. Now, while that's unplugged, leave it that way for about thirty seconds. I'm just going to check a couple things on my end here. (typing sounds) Let me see if there's any service alerts in your area... No, I'm not showing anything on our end currently. The network looks fine from this side.

Customer: Okay... so it's not like, a widespread outage?

Agent: No, doesn't look like it. Alright, has thirty seconds gone by?

Customer: Pretty close, yeah. I'd say so.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Alright, give it about a minute to boot back up. Sometimes these routers take a minute or so to fully initialize. While we're waiting, have you noticed any other issues recently? Like, has the internet been slow or disconnecting before today?

Customer: No, it's been fine. Like, it was working perfectly yesterday. I was streaming and everything.

Agent: Alright, good to know. (pause) Okay, it should be booted up by now. Are you seeing more lights on it?

Customer: Hmm, let me look. Yeah, I've got the green light on the left still, but the other lights are still pretty dim. I mean, maybe they're a tiny bit brighter than before? But I still can't connect to WiFi.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Can you try connecting to it anyway? Sometimes the lights can be a bit misleading. Do you have a device you can try to connect with?

Customer: Yeah, I'll try my phone. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at available networks... I don't see my network name showing up. That's weird.

Agent: Hmm, that is unusual. Alright, let's try something else. On the back of the router, there should be a small reset button. It's usually recessed inside a little hole. Do you see that?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Um, yeah, I think I see it. There's a little hole right here.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to have you hold that button in for about ten seconds with a paperclip or the tip of a pen. This will factory reset the router, but it'll help us determine if there's a configuration issue.

Customer: All right, let me find something. (pause) Okay, I've got a pen here. (sounds of clicking) I'm holding it in...

Agent: Good. Count to ten and let me know when you're done.

Customer: (pause) Okay... ten seconds. Done.

Agent: Great. Now the router's going to restart. This might take a couple minutes. Go ahead and just hold while it's doing that.

(extended pause, background noise)

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, so the lights are doing something different now. They're like, cycling through different colors.

Agent: Okay, that's actually... (pause) that's normal for a boot cycle. Let's wait for it to fully settle. Go ahead and wait about another minute.

(pause, typing sounds)

Customer: All right, I think it's settled now. The lights are more stable.

Agent: Perfect. Now, try to connect to your WiFi again. Check your phone and see if you're seeing the network broadcast.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, I'm still not seeing it. This is really strange. 

Agent: Okay, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Give me just one moment. I'm going to look at your modem's status here... (pause) Interesting. So the modem is showing as connected to our network, but I'm not seeing the WiFi broadcast on my end either.

Customer: Wait, really? So like, it's connected to your system, but something's wrong with the router itself?

Agent: That could be the case, yes. Or there might be an issue with the fiber connection between the wall and the modem. Let me ask you this—when you look at the back of the router where the cables plug in, do you see any cables that might be loose?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, let me look back here... I see the power cable, and then there's a cable that comes from the wall outlet. That one feels pretty secure... should I check anything else?

Agent: [inaudible] That's the fiber connection coming from your wall. Can you make sure that's firmly connected? Sometimes it can get jostled loose.

Customer: (pause) It seems fine. I mean, I can wiggle it a tiny bit, but it doesn't feel like it's going to fall out or anything.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Have you tried restarting any of your devices? Like, maybe restart your phone?

Customer: I'll try that real quick. (pause) Okay, I'm restarting it. (pause) All right, it's back on. Let me check for the WiFi... Nope. Still nothing.

Agent: All right, I've got to be honest with you, James. This is pointing toward either a hardware failure on the router's end or something more serious with the fiber connection itself. At this point, I think we might need to get a technician out to your location to do an in-person diagnosis.

Customer: (sighs) So you can't fix it over the phone?

Agent: I wish I could. I've walked through the basic troubleshooting steps, and the modem is communicating with our network, but the router isn't broadcasting. It could be a faulty unit, or it could be an issue with the ONT device at your wall. Either way, a technician will need to come out and physically check the equipment.

Customer: Okay... I mean, I work from home, so I really need this fixed soon. How quickly can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. We typically have appointments available within twenty-four to forty-eight hours. Let me see what we have... (pause) I can get you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or the day after that in the afternoon. Which works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. Let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. I've got you down for tomorrow, 8 AM to noon. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly, and a technician will be en route. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I understand. We appreciate your patience, James. If you have any other questions before the technician arrives, feel free to give us a call back. Thanks for choosing Frontier.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
