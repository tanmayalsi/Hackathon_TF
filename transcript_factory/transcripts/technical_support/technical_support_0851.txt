Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like two hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's, uh... (pause) ...555-0147. That's the number on my bill.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, James. Thank you. So you mentioned your internet went out this morning. Can you tell me what you were doing when it happened? Was it sudden, or did you notice it getting slower first?

Customer: No, it was just... completely out of nowhere. I was just sitting here working from home, and suddenly everything just stopped. No connection at all.

Agent: Understood. And have you done any troubleshooting on your end yet? Like, have you tried restarting your modem or router?

Customer: I restarted the modem, yeah. That didn't work. And I... I think I unplugged the router too, but nothing's changed.

Agent: Okay, good. Let me ask you this—when you look at your modem right now, what lights are you seeing? Are any of them lit up?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...there's a power light, and it's green. But the other lights... the internet light, I think? That one's not on. It's just dark.

Agent: Alright, so the power light is green, but the internet light is off. That's helpful information. And just to confirm, you're looking at the modem itself, not the router?

Customer: Yeah, the modem. It's that white box thing, right? With the cables?

Agent: Exactly right. And can you tell me how many cables are plugged into it?

Customer: Let me see... (pause) ...there's two cables. One's going into the wall, and one goes to the router.

Agent: Perfect. So we have power going in. Let me try something here. I'm going to send a restart signal to your modem from our end. This should take about two to three minutes. Can you just keep watching those lights and tell me what happens?

Customer: Oh, okay. Yeah, I can do that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, sending that now. Just give it a moment...

(pause)

Customer: Um, the lights are... they're flickering now. The power light went off and came back on.

Agent: Good, that's exactly what we want to see. It's rebooting. Just give it about another minute or so.

(pause)

Customer: Okay, so... the power light is solid green again, but that internet light is still off.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) When did you last contact us about any service issues?

Customer: I haven't, actually. I've had service for like... three years? Maybe four? I've never really had problems before.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. And can you tell me—do you see any kind of alert lights or any lights that might be amber or red?

Customer: There's... wait, there's one light that's kind of orange or amber. I didn't notice that before. Should that be on?

Agent: Can you see what that light says next to it? Like, is there any label?

Customer: (pause) ...I can barely see it. Looks like it might say... "LOS" maybe? Or... I'm not sure.

Agent: LOS—that stands for "Loss of Signal." That might be our culprit here. Let me ask you, when you look at the cable that goes into the wall—the one from the outside line—does it look like it's plugged in pretty securely?

Customer: Yeah, it seems pretty tight. I mean, I didn't mess with it or anything.

Agent: Okay. Can you try unplugging it for about ten seconds, and then plug it back in firmly?

Customer: Sure. (pause) (rustling sounds) Okay, it's unplugged. I'll wait a few seconds... (pause) ...alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) It's in.

Agent: Great. Let's give that a moment to resync and see if that LOS light clears up.

(pause)

Customer: No, it's still there. The orange light is still on.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Let me check our systems here. (typing sounds) I'm going to look at what we're seeing from the modem on our end. (typing sounds continue) (pause) James, I'm showing that we're not getting a connection from your line at all. Are there any storms in your area today? Anything like that?

Customer: Um, not right now, but we did have some pretty heavy rain this morning. Does that... could that have something to do with it?

Agent: It's possible. Heavy weather can sometimes affect the line. Let me check for any outages in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any widespread outages, but let me do something here. Can you unplug that modem completely—both the power cable and the line cable—and wait about thirty seconds?

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Both unplugged. I'll count to thirty... (long pause) Alright, I'm plugging everything back in.

(pause)

Agent: Good. Let's see if that helps reset things.

(pause)

Customer: I'm... I'm still getting nothing. That orange light is still there.

Agent: (pause) Okay, James, I want to make sure we're not missing anything simple. The cable that comes from outside, the one from the wall—is it definitely the same cable that's been there? You haven't had it replaced or anything?

Customer: No, it's been the same. I haven't touched anything out there.

Agent: Have you noticed any kind of damage to the cable? Like, if you can see any of it?

Customer: (pause) Let me go look. (pause) Um... I can see a little bit of it where it comes out of the wall. It looks... I mean, it looks fine to me. It's just a gray cable.

Agent: Alright. And it looks intact? No cuts or anything?

Customer: No, looks normal to me.

Agent: Okay. James, I'll be honest with you—based on everything we've tried, it seems like there might be an issue with the line coming into your house, or possibly with the equipment on our end. This is something that would require a technician to come out and take a look.

Customer: (pause) Oh, wow. So you can't fix it over the phone?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. But I do have some availability for you. We can get someone out there... (typing sounds) ...we have an opening tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM, or we have Wednesday morning between 8 and 12. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Um... I need this fixed sooner than that. I'm working from home. I can't go two days without internet.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see if we have anything sooner. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm showing that's the earliest we have available in your area. I know that's not ideal. Is there any possibility you could take one of those windows?

Customer: (frustrated sigh) I guess Tuesday afternoon would be better. The 12 to 4 window.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Can I get a callback number?

Customer: It's the same number, 555-0147.

Agent: Great, and just to confirm your address...

Customer: It's 1247 Maple Street, apartment 3B.

Agent: Perfect. So we have you scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, between 12 and 4 PM. You should get a courtesy call from the technician about an hour before they arrive. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just really hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sure they'll be able to get you back up and running. I apologize that we couldn't resolve this remotely, but our technicians are really good at diagnosing these kinds of issues. In the meantime, is there anything you need from me?

Customer: No, I think that's everything.

Agent: Alright, James. Thank you for being a valued Frontier customer, and thank you for your patience today. We'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a good day.
