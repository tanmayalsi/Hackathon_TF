# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, uh, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up here. And can I get your name?

Customer: It's David. David Patterson.

Agent: Great, David. I see your account here. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you tried restarting your modem and router yet?

Customer: Yeah, I did that right away. I unplugged everything for like a minute and plugged it back in. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, good troubleshooting step. Um, so when you say nothing—what do you mean? Are the lights on the modem coming on at all?

Customer: Yeah, so the lights are on, but they're... they're red, I think? Or orange? It's hard to tell. And like, nothing's connecting to it. My phone won't connect to the WiFi.

Agent: Okay, so the modem's powered on but you're not seeing any internet connection. That makes sense. Can you look at the modem right now for me? What model is it?

Customer: (pause) Um... it says "Frontier" on it, obviously. Let me see... (background shuffling) It's the... it looks like an Arista? Or Astera? Something like that.

Agent: Is it possibly a model number? It might start with "FG" or have some numbers on it?

Customer: (pause) Oh yeah, I see it now. FG1000 or... FG100? I'm not great at this stuff, sorry.

Agent: No worries at all. Let me look that up. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got it. So on that modem, you're gonna see a few lights on the front. Can you describe what you're seeing right now?

Customer: Okay, so there's... the power light is green. That one's definitely green. And then there's like three or four other lights below that, and they're all either red or orange. I don't know which ones are supposed to be on.

Agent: Right. So ideally, you should be seeing a green light for power—which you have—and then you should see lights for internet and WiFi that are also green or blue. The fact that you're seeing red across the board tells me there might be a line issue.

Customer: Okay, so what does that mean? Like, is it my modem that's broken?

Agent: Not necessarily. It could be a few things. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) When you say it went down this morning, do you remember what time, approximately?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 8 or 9 AM? I got up and tried to connect and nothing was working.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I'm not showing any outages in your area currently, but that doesn't mean there wasn't one earlier. Do you see a coaxial cable—that's the cable that comes into your modem from the wall?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's plugged in.

Agent: Okay, is it plugged in tight? Can you give it a gentle tug to make sure it's secure?

Customer: (background sounds) Yeah, it feels pretty tight. I don't think that's it.

Agent: Alright. Try unplugging it from the modem and plugging it back in. Make sure you hear a little click.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that now. (disconnection sound) Oh wait, the modem restarted. Lights went off and—(pause)—okay, they're coming back on.

Agent: Good, let it boot up for about 30 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) ...still all red or orange or whatever.

Agent: Yeah, still the same?

Customer: Yeah. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, let me try a different approach here. David, have you had any recent storms, or has anything else happened with your setup recently? Any construction in the neighborhood?

Customer: No storms. But actually, now that you mention it, there were some utility workers out here yesterday. They were doing something on the poles and street. Could that be related?

Agent: It very well could be. If they were working on the lines, they might've accidentally disconnected or damaged your line. That would definitely explain what you're seeing. Let me check if there's a ticket for that. (typing sounds, pause) I'm not showing anything in the system from yesterday.

Customer: So what do I do?

Agent: Okay, so here's what I want to try. Let me have you do a factory reset on your modem. This will erase any settings, so just a heads up. There should be a small reset button on the back. You'll need a paperclip or something to press it.

Customer: Factory reset? Won't that make things worse?

Agent: No, it shouldn't. If the modem is confused or corrupted, this usually clears it up. Go ahead and find that button for me.

Customer: (background sounds, pause) Okay, I've got a pen. Is a pen okay?

Agent: A pen should work fine. Press and hold it for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright, holding it. (pause) Okay, releasing. (disconnection sound, beeping) Oh man, everything went off.

Agent: Yep, that's normal. It's rebooting. Give it about two minutes to fully restart.

Customer: (long pause) Okay. It's still booting up. Still got all the red lights though.

Agent: [inaudible] ...still red?

Customer: Yeah. All red.

Agent: (pause) Okay. That's... that's not great. We're looking at something more than just a configuration issue then. Given the utility workers yesterday, and the consistent red lights, I'm fairly confident there's a line problem on the outside.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long does that take to fix?

Agent: So typically, we'd need to send a technician out. I can schedule you for a service call. The next available appointment we have is... (typing sounds, pause) ...Thursday between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Thursday? It's only Tuesday. I need my internet before then. Can't they come out today or tomorrow?

Agent: Let me check. (pause, typing sounds) Unfortunately, we're pretty booked today and tomorrow. I can put you on a list for a possible same-day visit, but I can't guarantee it. Or I can get you confirmed for Thursday.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) I mean, I guess Thursday is better than nothing. But this is really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand, David. I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me get you scheduled for Thursday. Can I confirm your phone number is still 555-0847?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. We have you down for Thursday, December 19th, between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will call you 30 minutes before arrival. In the meantime, is there anything else I can try to get you connected?

Customer: I don't know. Can I use my phone's hotspot or something?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. That would be a good workaround until we get this fixed. You can enable your phone's hotspot and connect your laptop or other devices to it. You might burn through some data, so just keep an eye on that.

Customer: Okay, I guess I'll do that.

Agent: Alright. I'm gonna go ahead and flag your account for that outside line issue, so the technician on Thursday will be prepared. And David, I do apologize again that we couldn't get this resolved today.

Customer: Yeah, well... I appreciate you trying, I guess. It's just not ideal.

Agent: I hear you. We'll get you back up and running soon. Your service call is confirmed for Thursday the 19th. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Okay, great. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and I'm sorry for the trouble. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye, David.
