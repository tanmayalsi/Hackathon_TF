# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Marcus. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was approximately?

Customer: Uh, I'd say around 7 or 7:30 AM. I tried turning everything off and back on, but nothing worked. The modem is still showing red lights.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Red lights typically indicate a connection issue. Before we dive deeper, let me just check our system here... (pause, typing) ...to see if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end, so that's good news. That means we should be able to troubleshoot this.

Customer: Okay, so what do I need to do?

Agent: Alright, so the first thing I'd like you to do is locate your modem and router. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Yeah, they're right here in front of me.

Agent: Great. So the modem is the device that's showing red lights, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's the one I'm looking at.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to walk you through a power cycle. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet?

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now I want you to wait about 30 seconds. This gives the modem time to fully discharge.

Customer: (pause) Alright, 30 seconds is up.

Agent: Okay, now go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Done. Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Now this is going to take a minute or two to boot back up. While we're waiting, let me ask you—do you have any other devices connected to your WiFi right now?

Customer: Um, yeah, I've got my laptop and my phone connected. That's it.

Agent: Okay, and you're not able to connect to either of those right now?

Customer: No, nothing. The WiFi isn't even showing up as an available network. It's just... gone.

Agent: I see. And the modem lights—what are you seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Still red. A couple of them are flashing, but mostly red.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Alright, I'm seeing the modem should have completed its startup by now. Typically when we see solid red lights like that, it usually means the modem isn't getting a signal from our network. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) 

Customer: Is that... is that bad?

Agent: Not necessarily. Could be a few different things. Let me just... (pause, typing) ...look at your modem's activation status here. Hmm, okay. The modem shows as active on our end, so that's interesting.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It means the modem itself is registered to your account and everything looks good from our system. But there may be an issue with the signal reaching your home. Have you noticed any loose cables or anything unusual with your setup?

Customer: Um, let me check. (pause) No, everything looks pretty secure to me. The cable from the wall to the modem looks fine.

Agent: Okay, good. Let me try a different approach here. Can you tell me what model modem you have? There should be a label on the back or bottom of it.

Customer: (pause) It says... Frontier FiberGateway XR-7, I think.

Agent: Okay, great. And just for my records, how long have you had that modem with us?

Customer: I'd say about three years now? Maybe a little longer.

Agent: Alright. So here's what I'd like to try next. I'm going to send a restart signal to your modem from here. This is different from what we did manually. Just give me one moment. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I've sent the signal. Can you tell me if the lights change at all?

Customer: (pause, pause) Um... no, not really. Still red.

Agent: Still red. Okay. (pause) Let me try one more thing. I'm going to check the line itself to see if there's any issue with the signal coming into your home. (typing sounds, pause) Hmm, interesting. The signal readings I'm seeing on my end are actually within normal parameters. That's... that's odd.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, the signal is fine but I'm not getting internet?

Agent: Right, which is strange. That typically would indicate either an issue with the modem itself or possibly a hardware failure. Before we go down that road though, let me ask you one more question. When you look at the modem, is there a battery backup light, and if so, is that lit up?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's a green light on the right side. Is that the battery?

Agent: No, that's actually the power indicator, so that's good. But I'm not seeing a separate backup battery indicator, so that's... that's fine.

Customer: Okay, so... what now? I've tried restarting it and nothing's working.

Agent: Yeah, I hear you. (pause) Alright, so given what we've tried and what I'm seeing on my end, I think we may need to get a technician out to your home to do a physical inspection of the line and the modem. There could be an issue with the fiber connection or the modem itself that I'm unable to diagnose remotely.

Customer: A technician? When would they be able to come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause, typing) Okay, so we have some openings tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we have... (pause) ...Wednesday morning between 8 AM and noon. Which of those would work better for you?

Customer: (sigh) I really need my internet working today if possible. Is there anything else we can try?

Agent: I completely understand, and I wish I had better news. At this point, we've done the standard troubleshooting steps—we've power cycled the modem, I've sent a remote restart, and I've verified that the signal is coming through properly on our end. Unfortunately, all signs are pointing to either a hardware issue with the modem or a physical connection problem that would require a technician to inspect in person.

Customer: This is really frustrating. I have work stuff I need to do from home.

Agent: I totally get it, and I'm sorry we're dealing with this. If you need internet access today, one option might be to use your mobile hotspot if you have a data plan? I know it's not ideal, but it might get you through until we can get a technician out there.

Customer: Yeah, I guess I can do that as a backup. Let me go ahead and book the technician for tomorrow. One to five?

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to schedule you for tomorrow, and our window is 1 to 5 PM. You'll receive a confirmation text and email with that appointment. The technician will call you 30 minutes before arrival so you'll know exactly when to expect them.

Customer: Okay. And they should be able to fix this?

Agent: They'll definitely be able to diagnose what's going on. If it's the modem, we can get you a replacement. If it's the line, they'll get that sorted as well.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything else I should do between now and then?

Agent: Just make sure the modem stays plugged in. Don't do any additional restarts unless it happens to come back online on its own. And clear any space around the modem so the technician has easy access to it when they arrive tomorrow.

Customer: Got it. Anything else?

Agent: No, I think we're all set. Again, I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. You should be up and running by tomorrow afternoon at the latest.

Customer: Alright, well... thanks for trying, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, you have a good day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.
