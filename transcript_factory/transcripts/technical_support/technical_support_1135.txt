Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out completely about an hour ago, and I've tried restarting the modem and the router already but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. Your name is Michael Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you're saying you've already restarted both your modem and router?

Customer: Yeah, I did that like twenty minutes ago. The modem's still showing the same lights as before—I think it's the internet light that's not on? It's hard to tell with all these lights.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me pull up your account and check if there are any service outages in your area. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported in your zip code, so let's walk through some troubleshooting steps together.

Customer: Alright, sounds good.

Agent: When you look at your modem right now, can you tell me what color the lights are? Specifically, is there a light that says "Internet" or has a globe symbol?

Customer: Um, let me look at it. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. There's a power light that's green. Then there's a couple others... one's amber, I think? And then one's like... off? I'm not great with this stuff.

Agent: That's fine, that's fine. So you have one that's amber—do you know which one that is?

Customer: (pause) It's kind of hard to see from where I'm sitting. There's a tiny label... it looks like it might say "Link" maybe?

Agent: Okay, and the one that's off—is that in the same area or a different section of the modem?

Customer: It's... I think it's lower. I'm not really sure to be honest.

Agent: No problem. Why don't you walk over to the modem right now so you can get a better look?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, okay, I'm here. Sorry, my office is on the other side of the house.

Agent: No worries. Take your time.

Customer: Alright, so looking at it now... the top light is green, that's the power. Below that is amber. Below that is... it looks like it might be green? And then further down there's a red light that's on.

Agent: Okay, that red light is important. That usually indicates an issue with the signal. Let me ask you—do you have a coaxial cable connected to the modem? It's the thick cable that screws in?

Customer: Oh yeah, I see that. It's connected.

Agent: Good. Can you check if it's screwed in tight? Sometimes they can loosen up.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, let me try twisting it... (pause) Okay, it's definitely tight. Maybe a little tighter now.

Agent: Alright. Let's give it about two minutes and see if the lights change at all. Sometimes it takes a moment for the signal to re-establish.

Customer: Okay, we're just waiting?

Agent: Yeah, if you want to just keep an eye on that modem and let me know if anything changes with those lights.

Customer: (pause) ...Still got the red light. Still showing the same thing.

Agent: Okay. Let me check something on the account side. (typing sounds) I'm going to ask you a couple questions. Have you had any recent storms or weather in your area?

Customer: Actually, now that you mention it, we did have some heavy rain last night. Really coming down.

Agent: That could definitely be a factor. Sometimes weather can affect the line coming into your house. Do you have an ONT box—that's like a white or gray box usually mounted outside your house or in a garage?

Customer: I... I'm not sure. Is that different from the modem?

Agent: Yes, it is. The ONT is what brings the fiber signal from the street into your house, and then your modem connects to that. Let me walk you through finding it.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: Do you have a garage?

Customer: I do.

Agent: Great. Can you check in your garage? It's usually mounted on the wall.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, okay, I'm going out to the garage now. (pause) I see... I see a white box mounted on the wall. Is that it?

Agent: That sounds like it could be. Is there a Frontier logo on it?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there is. So that's the ONT?

Agent: That's it. Can you see what lights are on the front of that box?

Customer: (pause) [inaudible] Let me get my phone for the flashlight... Okay, so I see... it looks like all the lights on this box are off or red?

Agent: Hmm, okay. That could definitely explain why you're not getting internet. Can you check if there's a fiber optic cable going into the box? It's thinner than a regular cable, usually yellow or orange?

Customer: Let me look... (pause) Yeah, I see a yellow cable going into it.

Agent: Good. Is it connected? Is it pushed in all the way?

Customer: (pause) It looks like it's... I can see a little bit of the connector that might not be fully seated? Let me push it in... (pause) I'm pushing it in... (pause)

Agent: Okay, give it a moment.

Customer: (pause) Alright, still getting nothing on the lights though.

Agent: Let's try disconnecting it and reconnecting it. Unplug it completely first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's out. Now what?

Agent: Wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in firmly.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now... (pause) ...Still nothing. The lights are still all off or red.

Agent: (pause) Let me check your account again to see if there are any notes about your line. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm not seeing anything unusual on my end, but it does seem like there might be an issue with the ONT box itself or potentially the fiber line coming to your house. Given that it was working before the storm last night, it's possible there's external damage.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, typically we would need to send a technician out to your location to diagnose the problem. There could be damage to the cable outside, or there could be an issue with the ONT that needs to be replaced.

Customer: How long would that take?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what availability we have... The soonest I can get someone out to you would be tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, I guess that'll have to do. I work from home, so this is... this is a problem.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get you scheduled. I'll also make a note on your account about the weather that occurred last night, and I'll flag this as a potential external line issue so the technician knows what to look for when they arrive.

Customer: Okay, what's my appointment number or something?

Agent: (typing sounds) Your appointment confirmation number is 847293. That'll be tomorrow, Wednesday, between noon and 4 PM. Is the address on file still correct? 447 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And we'll have a technician contact you about thirty minutes before they arrive. In the meantime, there's really not much else I can troubleshoot on my end, but I do apologize that we weren't able to get this resolved today.

Customer: Yeah, alright. I guess I'll just have to wait until tomorrow then.

Agent: I'm sorry about that. Is there anything else I can help you with before we end the call?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, Michael. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. We appreciate your business, and we'll get you back online tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
