# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back up. I've been without service for like three hours now.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I found you. So you're in the Riverside area, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And you mentioned your internet went out this morning. Have you had any outages recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. Everything was working fine last night. I woke up this morning, tried to check my email, and nothing. The modem just... it's not connecting.

Agent: Okay, understood. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. Can you tell me, when you look at your modem right now, what lights are you seeing on the front?

Customer: Um, let me go look at it. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. There's... the power light is on, it's solid green. But the internet light—that's the one that looks like... I think it's supposed to be blue?

Agent: Yes, that's right. The internet light should be solid blue when you have a good connection.

Customer: Yeah, well, it's not blue. It's red. And it's blinking.

Agent: Okay, a blinking red light indicates the modem is trying to establish a connection but it's not able to. Let's try a restart. Can you unplug the modem for me?

Customer: Okay. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Let's leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. While we're waiting, did you notice any power outages in your area this morning?

Customer: Actually, now that you mention it, there was a brief flicker earlier. Maybe around 6 AM? But the lights came right back on.

Agent: That could definitely be related. Sometimes after a power event, the modem can take a little while to resync with the network. (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in device) Done.

Agent: (pause) Alright, give it about two minutes to boot up completely. While it's starting, have you noticed any other issues? Ethernet cable still connected?

Customer: Yeah, the cable's connected. Everything's plugged in where it should be.

Agent: Good. And just to confirm, you're connecting via ethernet, not WiFi?

Customer: WiFi. But my phone isn't picking it up either, so...

Agent: Right, that makes sense. Okay, what's the status now? Any change on those lights?

Customer: (pause) The power light is still green. The internet light is... it's still red. But I think it might be blinking slower now? Maybe?

Agent: Okay, that could be a good sign. Sometimes it takes a full three to five minutes to fully resync, especially after a power event. Let's give it another minute or two.

Customer: How long is this usually supposed to take?

Agent: Normally, from a cold boot, you're looking at about two to three minutes. But given that power flicker you mentioned, it might take a bit longer. (pause) Is it showing any change now?

Customer: (pause) No, it's still red. Still blinking. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand, David. Let me try a different approach. Let me check on our end if there are any service issues in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages in the Riverside service area at this moment.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it means the issue is likely localized to your equipment or connection. Let me ask you a couple more questions. Do you have a battery backup unit connected to your modem?

Customer: A what?

Agent: A battery backup—it's usually a box that sits near your modem, kind of like a surge protector.

Customer: Oh, no, I don't think so. Just the modem and the router.

Agent: Okay. And is there a coaxial cable—that's the cable that comes from the wall—is that firmly connected to the back of the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Can you try unscrewing it and screwing it back in? Sometimes the connection can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) (grunt) Okay... (sounds of unscrewing) (pause) It was a little loose, actually. Let me screw it back in. (sounds of screwing) There, that's tighter now.

Agent: Good catch. Let's see if that makes a difference. What are the lights showing now?

Customer: (pause) Still red. Still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Alright. And you mentioned the power flickered around 6 AM. Has there been any storm activity in your area?

Customer: Not that I noticed, but I was still asleep when it happened.

Agent: Fair enough. Let me try accessing your modem remotely to get some diagnostic information. What's the model number on the front of your modem?

Customer: Um, (pause) it says... Frontier Model... uh... FX-5000?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up the specs now. (pause) [inaudible] Yes, that's one of our standard units. David, I'm going to need you to do a full factory reset on this modem. This will erase all settings, so just be aware of that.

Customer: Will I have to call back in? I don't know my password or anything.

Agent: No, you won't need to. I can reconfigure it for you remotely once it reboots. The reset button should be on the back of the modem—it might be recessed, so you might need a paperclip or pen to press it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. (pause) I'm pressing it now. (pause) Okay, the modem is rebooting. All the lights are going crazy.

Agent: Perfect, that's exactly what should happen. Let it cycle through completely. This might take a few minutes.

Customer: (pause) How many minutes are we talking?

Agent: Usually about three to five. While we wait, let me put you on a brief hold so I can pull up some additional diagnostics on my end. I'll be back in just a moment.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (hold music plays for approximately 1 minute) (hold music stops) Thanks for holding, David. Are the lights still cycling?

Customer: Yeah, they're still going. This is taking a while.

Agent: (pause) They should be almost done. Let me know once you see them stabilize.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... okay, they're stabilizing now. The power light is green again. And the internet light is... (pause) ...still red.

Agent: Still red?

Customer: Yeah. Solid red now, not blinking, but definitely red.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Let me try something from my end. Can you give me just one second? (typing sounds) (pause) David, I'm not seeing your modem appearing on the network right now. And that's concerning because it should have reregistered after the reset.

Customer: What does that mean? Does my modem have a problem?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It might be a hardware issue, or there could be a signal problem on the line from the street. Normally, I would schedule a technician to come out and run a full line test.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me try one more thing before we go that route. Can you check the ethernet cable running from your modem to your computer? Make sure it's securely connected?

Customer: (pause) It's connected.

Agent: And is there a second cable, maybe running into the back of the modem from the wall?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one you had me tighten.

Agent: Right. Okay, David, I think at this point, we may be looking at a hardware failure or a line issue that I can't diagnose over the phone. I'd really like to get a technician out to your location to do some hands-on troubleshooting.

Customer: How soon can they come? I work from home, so this is a pretty big deal.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) We have next available appointment for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: That's the best you can do? I've been without internet since this morning.

Agent: I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, our emergency appointments are already booked for today. But I'm going to mark this as high priority, and I'll make sure the technician knows to come early in that window if possible.

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, okay. Tomorrow morning then.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. The technician will be able to test the line, check the equipment, and get you back up and running. Is the number we have on file, 555-0147, still the best way to reach you?

Customer: That's fine.

Agent: Excellent. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with this evening?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Thanks for trying, anyway.

Agent: You're welcome, David, and again, I apologize we couldn't resolve this tonight. A technician will be out tomorrow morning, and we'll get this sorted out for you. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and have a good night.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
