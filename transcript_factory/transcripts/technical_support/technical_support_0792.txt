Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging the modem and everything, and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... and I've got your account. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. When did you first notice the internet went down?

Customer: Like I said, about an hour ago. I was working from home and then suddenly everything just stopped. All my devices lost connection.

Agent: Right, okay. So all your devices lost connection at the same time. That's helpful to know. Can you tell me—do you see any lights on your modem right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, there's a red light on it. Is that bad?

Agent: A red light typically indicates that there's no connection to our network. Alright, so here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna walk you through a few troubleshooting steps. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay, doing it now... (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And can you also unplug your router while you're there?

Customer: Yeah, I've got it unplugged too.

Agent: Perfect. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds. Just give the equipment a chance to fully power down.

Customer: (pause) Alright, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in first. That's the one with the red light.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in... okay, it's plugged in now.

Agent: (pause) What lights are you seeing now?

Customer: Um, it's got some green lights now. And there's like a white light... let me see... yeah, there's a white light blinking.

Agent: Okay, the blinking white light means it's trying to establish a connection. That's normal. Let's give it about a minute to fully boot up and connect. While we wait, can you tell me—have you had any recent storms or weather issues in your area?

Customer: Not that I know of. The weather's been pretty clear actually.

Agent: Alright, good. And you haven't experienced any outages recently? Nothing in the past week or so?

Customer: No, nothing. It's been working great until today.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so what are the lights showing you now?

Customer: Um... (pause) Still blinking. The white one is still blinking. Some of the green ones are solid though.

Agent: Alright, let's plug the router back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, router's plugged in.

Agent: Give that another minute to boot up. While we're waiting, let me check on our network on this end. (typing sounds) (pause) Let me see here... (pause) Hm, okay. Can you check on your modem again? How are those lights looking now?

Customer: Well, the white light finally stopped blinking. Now it looks like... (pause) most of them are green and solid. The white one's still there but it's not blinking anymore.

Agent: Good, that's... that's progress. Can you try connecting to your WiFi now? Just pick up your phone or a laptop and see if you can see your network.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm picking up my phone... looking for the WiFi network... (pause) I don't see it. The network isn't showing up.

Agent: It's not showing up at all?

Customer: No, it's not there.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Alright, let me check on the router. Do you see any lights on the router at all?

Customer: Yeah, there's like... a green light on the front. And an amber light, I think?

Agent: Okay, an amber light... that usually means it's not fully connected. Let me try something. I'm gonna check the line from our end. This might take just a moment. (pause) (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm checking... checking the signal... (longer pause) I'm getting a signal from your modem, but it seems like there's an issue on the line side. Can you try something for me? Can you unplug the cable that goes from the wall into your modem? The Ethernet cable or coax cable—whatever's connected to your modem from the wall.

Customer: Oh, yeah, okay... (pause) I've got it unplugged.

Agent: Alright, can you take a look at that cable? Is there any visible damage? Anything bent or pinched?

Customer: (pause) No, it looks fine to me. It's just a normal cable.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug that back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugged it back in.

Agent: Alright, and does your modem have a button on it that says "reset" or "restart"?

Customer: Uh... (pause) yeah, I see a little button here on the back. It says "reset."

Agent: Okay, don't press that yet. I just wanted to confirm it was there. (pause) Let me actually check something on my end real quick. I'm gonna look at your line diagnostics. (typing sounds) (pause) (longer pause) Hmm, that's interesting. It looks like... (pause) I'm seeing some signal fluctuations on your line. It might be something on our infrastructure side. Let me try to reset your modem remotely. This might take a few moments.

Customer: Oh, okay.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) (longer pause) Alright, I've sent the reset command. Can you watch your modem and tell me if the lights change at all?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, they went out. Everything's dark now. (pause) And now they're coming back on... okay, the lights are back. White light's blinking again.

Agent: (pause) Okay, give it about two minutes to fully boot back up. Let me pull up your account details again. (typing sounds) (longer pause)

Customer: (pause) The white light stopped blinking again. So I guess... is that good?

Agent: That should be good, yeah. Can you try the WiFi network again?

Customer: (pause) Checking my phone... (pause) Still not there. I'm not seeing the network.

Agent: It's still not showing up?

Customer: No, nothing.

Agent: Alright, um... (pause) Let me check something here. (typing sounds) I'm showing that your line is active and the modem appears to be provisioned correctly, but I'm not seeing a successful connection to the network. That's... that's a bit unusual. Have you tried restarting your router manually? Like, unplugging it again?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I just unplugged it. Let me plug it back in... (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Alright, give that a minute and then try the WiFi again.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Checking now... (pause) Nope. Still nothing. The network's still not showing up.

Agent: (pause) Hmm, okay. This is... this is puzzling. Let me tell you what I'm thinking. I'm showing signal on our end, but it looks like there might be an issue with either the router itself or something on the line that's preventing the connection from fully establishing. At this point, I think we might need to escalate this. I'd like to have a technician come out and take a look at your setup. They'll be able to physically check the line and the equipment to see what's going on.

Customer: Oh, so you can't fix it over the phone?

Agent: I wish I could, but given what I'm seeing in your account and the steps we've already tried, it really seems like something physical that needs to be checked. The good news is we can get someone out there pretty quickly. When would be a good time for you? Are you available this week?

Customer: (pause) I mean, I need this fixed today if possible. I'm working from home.

Agent: I totally understand. Let me see what we have available. (pause) (typing sounds) (longer pause) Looking at our schedule... I can get someone out there today, but it would be... it looks like the earliest would be between 2 and 5 p.m. Does that work for you?

Customer: It's already 1:30... yeah, that could work.

Agent: Perfect. So I can schedule a technician to come out between 2 and 5 p.m. today. Can I confirm your address?

Customer: It's 447 Maple Drive, apartment 2B.

Agent: (typing sounds) 447 Maple Drive, apartment 2B. Perfect. And the best contact number is the one you're calling from?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Alright, I've got that all set up. You should expect someone between 2 and 5 p.m. today. They'll be able to diagnose the issue and get you back up and running. Is there anything else I can help you with while we're on the call?

Customer: No, I guess not. I just hope they can fix it quickly.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize that we weren't able to resolve it remotely. But our technicians are really good about getting things taken care of. You'll be back online soon. You should receive a text and email confirmation of the appointment within the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier, and sorry again for the inconvenience today.

Customer: Yeah, no problem. Thanks.

Agent: Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
