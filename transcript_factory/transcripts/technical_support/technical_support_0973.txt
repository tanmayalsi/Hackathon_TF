# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of, so I'm hoping you guys can help me out.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that! I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me just pull up your account here real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, I've got you here. And your name?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Thanks, David. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you restarted your modem and router yet?

Customer: Yeah, I did that right away. I unplugged the modem, waited like thirty seconds, plugged it back in. Nothing changed.

Agent: Okay, okay. And when you say nothing changed, are you not getting any lights on the modem at all, or...?

Customer: No, the lights are on. The modem's got the usual lights, you know, power, internet, WiFi... they're all there. It's just like, no actual internet coming through. I tried hardwiring my laptop directly to the modem, and nothing. WiFi's not working either.

Agent: Alright, so the modem is powered on and the lights look normal. That's good information. Let me check your account here... (pause) (typing) I'm going to run a line test on my end to see if we're getting a signal to your location. Can you give me one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure, take your time.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing some activity on the line, which is good. Let me ask you—have you had any weather lately? Any storms or anything that might've affected things?

Customer: Um, no, not really. It was pretty nice this morning. Why, does that matter?

Agent: It can sometimes. Bad weather can affect the signal, but since you haven't had any storms, that's probably not it. (pause) Alright, I'm going to walk you through a few more things. Can you go ahead and check the back of your modem for me? I want to make sure all the cables are plugged in securely.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. Um, I see the power cable, that's in. There's an ethernet cable... (pause) wait, hold on. Is there supposed to be another cable going in here? There's like... I don't know, a coaxial cable or something?

Agent: Yes! There should be a coax cable—that's your line input. That's the one that connects to the wall. Can you check if that's plugged in all the way?

Customer: (rustling) Yeah, it's... it looks like it's in there pretty good. I mean, I could try tightening it?

Agent: Go ahead and give it a gentle twist to the right—not too hard, just until it feels snug.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay... (pause) ...did that. Any difference on your end?

Agent: (typing) Let me check... (pause) No, I'm still not seeing an active connection coming through. Hmm. (pause) Okay, let me ask you something else—when did you last have your internet working?

Customer: Yesterday evening, definitely. I was streaming Netflix, everything was fine. I went to bed, woke up this morning around seven, tried to check my email, and nothing.

Agent: Got it. And you haven't done anything like changed any settings or moved the modem or anything like that?

Customer: No, no, I haven't touched anything. It's just sitting where it's always been.

Agent: Okay. (pause) David, I'm going to have you try one more thing with me. I want you to do a factory reset on the modem. This will clear everything out, so it might take a few minutes to boot back up.

Customer: Um... will I lose anything? Like my WiFi password or...?

Agent: You might need to set that back up, yes. But don't worry, I can walk you through reconnecting everything once we get the modem back online. Let's try this first—can you locate the reset button? It's usually a small button, might be recessed into the back.

Customer: (rustling) Yeah, I see it. It's like a tiny little button.

Agent: That's the one. Go ahead and press and hold it for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... (pause) ...and it's rebooting. I can see the lights going crazy. The power light's blinking now.

Agent: That's normal. Go ahead and just let it sit for a couple minutes while it reboots. This usually takes about two or three minutes.

Customer: Alright, I'll wait. (pause) This is frustrating. I've got a work call at noon and I really need the internet back.

Agent: I totally understand, and I'm going to do everything I can to get you back up and running. Let's see if that reset does the trick. (pause) Okay, is it done rebooting yet?

Customer: Um, almost I think? Yeah, okay, the lights are settling down now. Power light's solid, the internet light is... (pause) ...it's still not lit up all the way. It's like faintly lit but not solid.

Agent: Okay, so the internet light is not fully lit. That tells me the modem is still not detecting a signal from our line. (typing) Let me run another line test... (pause) (typing) ...and I'm still not picking up that connection on our end.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it a problem with your line or the modem?

Agent: Well, based on what I'm seeing, it looks like there might be an issue with the signal coming into your property. It could be the modem itself—these things do fail sometimes—but it could also be something on the line outside. 

Customer: Oh no. So what do we do?

Agent: (pause) So here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to get a technician out to your location to physically check the line and potentially swap out the modem if needed. That way we can figure out exactly what's going on.

Customer: How long would that take? Like when could someone come out?

Agent: (typing) Let me check availability... (pause) The earliest I can schedule you is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? But I have that work call at noon today...

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry. Unfortunately, our next available window for same-day service in your area is... (typing) ...not until late this afternoon, around 4 PM to 8 PM. Could you do that?

Customer: (sigh) I guess I could do the evening. Let me do the afternoon slot if that's possible.

Agent: Let me see what we have... (typing) (pause) Unfortunately, that 4 to 8 PM slot is actually our last availability today. But I can get you a technician for that window.

Customer: Okay, fine. Let's do 4 to 8 PM.

Agent: Perfect. And just to clarify—that's tomorrow, between 4 PM and 8 PM?

Customer: Wait, no. I meant today. This evening if possible.

Agent: (pause) Oh, I apologize for the confusion. Let me check the schedule again... (typing) We do have that 4 to 8 PM window available for today. So yes, I can get you scheduled for this afternoon, 4 PM to 8 PM. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, today at 4 PM to 8 PM. That works.

Agent: Great. (typing) Okay, I've got you down for a technician visit today from 4 to 8 PM. You should receive a text message and an email confirmation here in a moment. The technician will have all the tools they need to run a full diagnostic and hopefully get you back online.

Customer: Okay, and you can't do anything else right now to get the internet back before the tech gets here?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, without seeing the physical line setup, I've hit the limit of what I can troubleshoot remotely. The technician will be able to check everything—the external line, the connection points, and swap the modem if needed.

Customer: Alright. I guess I'll just have to use my phone hotspot for my work call. This is really inconvenient.

Agent: I completely understand, and I really do apologize. We should have someone there between 4 and 8 PM today, and they'll make this their priority to get you back online.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Is there anything else I should try before they get here?

Agent: You know what, just leave the modem powered on as is. Don't try any more resets or anything. That way the technician can see the current status when they arrive.

Customer: Alright, I'll do that.

Agent: Perfect. And David, I want to make sure you have my reference number in case you need to reach back out. It's 447892. Do you have something to write that down?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, hold on... okay, go ahead.

Agent: 447892.

Customer: Got it.

Agent: Alright, you're all set. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hoping the tech can figure this out this afternoon.

Agent: I'm confident they will. Thanks for your patience, David, and again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
