Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of. It's just not working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here so I can help get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... um... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I get the name on the account please?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. Thanks for that. Alright, I've got your account here. I can see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So the internet just went out about an hour ago you said?

Customer: Yeah, right around 3 o'clock. I was working from home and everything was fine, and then just suddenly... nothing. No internet at all.

Agent: Okay. Let me ask you a few questions first. Do you have the Frontier modem and router that we provided?

Customer: Yes, I do. I've got both of them sitting right here.

Agent: Great. Can you take a look at the lights on the front of the modem for me? Tell me which ones are lit up or if any are blinking.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... the power light is on, it's solid green. And then I see the internet light, and that one is... red. It's just solid red.

Agent: Alright, so the power is good but the internet light is red. That tells me the modem isn't getting a signal from our network. Let's try the most basic fix first. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out of the back.

Customer: Yeah, doing it now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Good. And while that's unplugged, can you also unplug the router for me?

Customer: The router too? Okay. (pause) Yep, both unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about 30 seconds just to let everything completely power down. Sometimes a restart is all it takes.

Customer: (long pause) ...Still waiting?

Agent: Yeah, we're almost there. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) It's back on.

Agent: Alright, let's wait for it to boot up. This usually takes about a minute or so. You should see the lights come back on.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see the power light again. The internet light is still red though.

Agent: (pause) It's still red?

Customer: Yeah, it hasn't changed.

Agent: Okay, that's... that's not what we typically see after a restart. Let me try something else. Can you tell me if you see any other cables plugged into the modem? There should be an ethernet cable coming from the wall outlet.

Customer: From the wall? Um, yeah, I see a cable that goes into the back of the modem.

Agent: Okay, can you check if that cable is firmly connected? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) I'm pulling it out and plugging it back in... (sound of cable connection) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Good. Let's give it another minute to see if that helps.

Customer: (pause) ...Nope. Still red.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, so it's not a network-wide issue. Let me check your modem status in our system. (pause) I'm actually showing that your modem is offline right now. Can you do me a favor and hold the reset button on the back of the modem? It's a small button you'll need to press with something like a pen or a paperclip.

Customer: Oh, the reset button? Yeah, okay... (pause) ...I found it. How long do I hold it?

Agent: Hold it for about ten seconds. That should do a full factory reset of the modem.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm holding it. (pause) ...Okay, letting go now.

Agent: Good. Now it's going to take a few minutes to fully reboot. While we're waiting on that, let me just make sure there aren't any other issues I should know about. Have you had any recent weather? Any storms or anything like that?

Customer: Not really, no. It's been pretty clear all day. Actually, I don't think we've had weather like that in a week.

Agent: Okay, that's good. (pause) Let me... let me check if there have been any recent maintenance windows on the line. (typing sounds) (pause) I do see there was some scheduled maintenance in your area last night, but that was supposed to be completed by 2 AM this morning. That shouldn't be affecting you now. (pause) Do you see any change on the modem yet?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...The internet light is still red. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Still red. Okay. Let me try escalating this a bit. Are you able to look at the back of the modem? I need the serial number and the MAC address. There should be a sticker on the back.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I've got it. The serial number is... FNT-7734-B2-W. And the MAC address is... 00:1A:2B:4C:3D:5E.

Agent: (typing sounds) Thank you. Okay, I'm entering that information now. Let me check if there's an issue with your line provisioning... (pause, longer silence) (pause) Hmm. (pause) That's strange.

Customer: What? What's strange?

Agent: Well, the modem isn't showing up in our system at all anymore. It's like it's been... disconnected. Let me try to re-provision it manually. (typing sounds, pause) I'm going to send a signal to your modem now.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay? Should I see something happen?

Agent: You might see some lights flicker or change. Just give it a moment.

Customer: (long pause) (pause) Nope. Nothing. Still the same red light.

Agent: (sigh) Okay, James. I've tried a few things here and I'm not getting the response I would normally expect from the modem. The fact that it's completely offline in our system and the reset didn't bring it back online suggests there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or possibly an issue with the line coming into your home that I can't diagnose from here.

Customer: So... what does that mean? What do we do?

Agent: Well, normally what I'd recommend is that we schedule a technician to come out and take a look at your setup. They can check the line from the street, test the connections, and if it's the modem, they can replace it for you. But I know that's not an ideal situation if you need your internet today.

Customer: Yeah, I mean... I'm working from home. I really need this working.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what I can do. Do you have availability for a technician to come out? We might be able to get someone out there as soon as today or tomorrow morning.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would work better for me. What time are we talking?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check the schedule. (pause) I'm seeing that we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM in your area. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. That works.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I have you scheduled for tomorrow, Wednesday the 15th, between 8 and 12. The technician will be able to diagnose the issue and get you back up and running. You should receive a confirmation email and a text message shortly with all those details.

Customer: Okay, thank you. Is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: At this point, I'd say leave the modem unplugged. There's nothing else really to troubleshoot. The tech will handle it when they get there. I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate your help.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Again, sorry for the inconvenience. Your technician will be there between 8 and 12 tomorrow morning. If you have any questions, you can always reach us at the number on your bill. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
