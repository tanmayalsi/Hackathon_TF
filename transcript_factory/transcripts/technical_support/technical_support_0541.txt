Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just... it's completely down. Like, nothing is working at all.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's 555-0847. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, this is... Robert Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So you mentioned your internet is completely down. When did you first notice this stopped working?

Customer: This morning, actually. I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing was loading. I restarted my computer, but that didn't help, so... I don't know, figured I'd call you guys.

Agent: That makes sense. Okay, well, let's get this sorted out for you. First, I'm just going to ask you a few quick questions. Do you see any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Uh, let me... (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at the modem. I see like... the power light is on, I think. It's green. But then there's another light that's usually on and it's not lit up right now.

Agent: Okay, good. Which light isn't on? Is it the internet light, or the one that might say WiFi?

Customer: I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. There's like... multiple lights on there. Let me see... (pause) One says "Internet" on it and that one's not lit. That's probably the problem, right?

Agent: Yeah, that could definitely be it. So the Internet light is off. Okay, let me have you do a quick restart. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet for me?

Customer: Right now?

Agent: Yeah, just for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it. (background noise) Just waiting here...

Agent: (pause) Take your time.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. Now what?

Agent: Now just wait about thirty seconds. You can count it out or just give it a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay... thirty seconds should be about... now?

Agent: Good. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's just give it about a minute to boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me if you had any weather issues in your area last night? Any storms or anything like that?

Customer: Uh, actually, yeah. There was some pretty heavy rain and wind last night. I didn't think about that until you asked, but yeah, it was kind of gnarly.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. Weather can sometimes affect things. Is the Internet light on yet, or is it still off?

Customer: (pause) Still off. It's... the power light is still green, but that Internet one is not coming on.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) Robert, I'm showing that your service should be active. Let me check if there's an outage in your area.

Customer: Oh, is there an outage?

Agent: (typing sounds) Checking now... No, I'm not seeing any reported outages in your neighborhood. But let me ask you this—is your computer, or the device you're trying to use, is it plugged in with an ethernet cable or are you trying to connect through WiFi?

Customer: WiFi. I'm using WiFi on my laptop.

Agent: Okay. So even though the Internet light isn't on, let me just ask—do you see your WiFi network name showing up when you look at available networks?

Customer: (pause) Uh... no, I don't. I don't see the usual network. That's not there at all.

Agent: Alright, that confirms it. The router isn't broadcasting. Let me have you check something for me. Can you look at the back of the modem and tell me if there are any cables loose or disconnected?

Customer: (pause) Okay, looking at the back... I see the power cord, and there's like... two other cables back here. One's plugged in and one's... wait, this one might be loose.

Agent: Ah, there you go. Can you push that in for me? Just make sure it's seated all the way.

Customer: (pause) Pushing it in... Yeah, I think that's tighter now. (pause) Should I restart again or...?

Agent: Let's wait a moment and see if the light comes on. Give it about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Uh... still nothing. The Internet light is still not on.

Agent: (pause) Still nothing, huh? Okay. Let me check something else on the backend here. (typing sounds) I'm going to check the signal levels coming to your house... (pause) Okay, so I am seeing signal, which is good. But you know what, let me have you power cycle the modem one more time, but this time we'll also unplug the router if you have a separate one.

Customer: There's a separate router, yeah.

Agent: Okay, so unplug both of those. The modem and the router.

Customer: (unplugging sounds) Both unplugged. How long this time?

Agent: Same thing, about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright. (pause) Okay, plugging the modem back in first. (plugging sounds) There we go. And now the router. (plugging sounds)

Agent: Perfect. Let's give them about a minute to fully boot up and sync together.

Customer: (pause) Okay, we're waiting... (pause) So Marcus, is this... this doesn't seem like a normal thing, right? Like, this is pretty broken if it needs all this troubleshooting.

Agent: Well, sometimes it's just one of those things. The power cycle usually does the trick, but we'll see. Go ahead and check those lights for me now.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) The power light is on, the modem... same as before. And the Internet light... (pause) ...still not on.

Agent: Still not on? Okay. (pause) Alright, Robert, I think at this point we might be looking at a hardware issue, or possibly something happening on the line itself. I don't want to keep you going in circles here. Let me just connect you with our technical support team. They have more advanced tools to diagnose what's going on, and if needed, they can schedule a technician to come out to your house.

Customer: Oh, so like, I have to pay for someone to come out?

Agent: Good question. Since we've gone through the basic troubleshooting and the issue persists, the first technician visit would be covered under your service agreement. But let me get you to the tech team and they can give you all the details and set that up for you.

Customer: Okay, I guess that's... that's fine. I need this working, so...

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get you transferred over. It should just be a moment, but you might hear a little hold music.

Customer: (pause) Alright.

Agent: Thank you for your patience, Robert. You're all set to be transferred.

(hold music begins)
