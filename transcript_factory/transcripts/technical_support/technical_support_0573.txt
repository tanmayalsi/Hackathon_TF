Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I have some work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account here. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you tried restarting your modem and router yet?

Customer: Um, no, not yet actually. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. That resolves a lot of issues. What I need you to do is unplug the modem—that's the device that connects to your wall outlet and has the cables going into it. Leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds, then plug it back in. While that's restarting, you can do the same thing with your router if you have a separate one.

Customer: Okay, so unplug the modem... (sounds of movement) ...alright, it's unplugged. How long do I wait?

Agent: About thirty seconds should do it. That gives the system a chance to fully reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay... plugging it back in now. (pause) Alright, it's coming back on. I see the lights starting to... yeah, they're lighting up.

Agent: Great. Give it about two minutes to fully boot up and reconnect. While we're waiting, have you noticed any other issues? Like, are there any alert lights on the modem or anything that looks unusual?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) ...no, I don't think so. The lights are all doing their thing. I'm not sure what normal is, but they seem okay.

Agent: (chuckling) That's alright. So are you able to see your WiFi network on your devices now?

Customer: (pause) Let me check my phone here... (pause) Hmm, no. I don't see... wait, I see "Frontier-2847," is that mine?

Agent: That sounds right. Can you try connecting to it?

Customer: Yeah, okay... (pause) ...oh, it's asking for a password. What's the password?

Agent: That should be on a sticker on the back of your router. It'll say "WiFi Password" or sometimes just "Key."

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking... (pause) ...okay, I found it. Let me type this in... (pause) Alright, it says it's connected now. But... I'm still not getting internet. Like, it's connected to the network but nothing's loading.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check a few things here. (typing sounds) (pause) So I'm looking at your account and... it looks like your service is active and showing as connected on our end too. That's actually a good sign. Let me ask you—are you using WiFi or are you plugged in with an ethernet cable?

Customer: I'm on WiFi with my phone right now.

Agent: Okay, can you try an ethernet cable if you have one? Just plug it directly into the modem for a second. That'll help us figure out if it's a WiFi issue or something else.

Customer: Do I have... (pause) ...yeah, I think I have one somewhere. Give me a second. (background noise, sounds of rummaging) Okay, I got one. Plugging in now... (pause) Nope. Still nothing. Not loading anything.

Agent: Alright, so it's not a WiFi issue then. Let me check a couple more things. Can you tell me what lights are showing on the modem right now? Like, are they all solid green, or do you see any red or orange?

Customer: (pause) They're mostly... green and blue? There's like a blue one on the left and then some green ones. One of them might be blinking? It's kind of hard to tell in this light.

Agent: Okay, that's pretty normal actually. The blinking usually means it's trying to connect or sync. Let me pull up your connection history here. (pause) (typing sounds) (pause) James, I'm seeing some connection drops on your line this morning. It looks like your modem lost connection around 8:47 a.m. It tried to reconnect, but then dropped again.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it a problem on your guys' end or my end?

Agent: That's what I'm trying to figure out. It could be either, honestly. Is there anything else you've noticed? Like, did you have any storms last night or anything like that?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear. There was maybe some wind yesterday but nothing crazy.

Agent: Alright. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you restart the modem one more time, but this time hold the reset button for about ten seconds? It's usually a small button on the back. Just use a paperclip or something.

Customer: (pause) The reset button? Won't that... won't that erase everything?

Agent: It'll reset it to factory settings, but don't worry—it won't cause any permanent damage. Your account information is all stored on our end. It might help clear out whatever's causing the connection issue.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I guess. (sounds of movement) (pause) Okay, I found it. I'm holding it down... ten seconds... (pause) Alright, releasing it. It's restarting now.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give it about three to four minutes to fully reboot this time.

Customer: (pause) So... we're just waiting?

Agent: Yeah, we're just letting it do its thing. How's your day going otherwise?

Customer: (chuckling) Well, better before my internet went out. I'm supposed to have this presentation ready by this afternoon and I can't really do it without—

Agent: I totally get it. We'll get you back online. (pause) Okay, are you seeing any changes with the lights yet?

Customer: (pause) No, not really. They're still... (pause) ...okay, wait, one of them just turned solid green. That's new, I think.

Agent: That's good. That's a good sign actually. Try connecting again now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, connecting to the WiFi... (pause) It's connected again. Let me try opening... (pause) ...nope. Still nothing. The page isn't loading.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay, James, I'm going to be honest with you. The connection drops we're seeing and the fact that it's not staying online after the reset... that suggests there might be something on the line itself, like maybe a cable issue or a line problem in your area. 

Customer: Oh, great. So what do I do?

Agent: I'm going to schedule a technician to come out and check the physical connection. That way they can inspect the cable and make sure everything's properly connected. They can also check the line from the street to your house.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that... that sounds good. When can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm seeing... we have someone available tomorrow morning between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m., or we could schedule for Thursday afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works. That's better than Thursday.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, your address is 447 Maple Street, apartment 3B?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, all set. You're scheduled for tomorrow morning. Is there a best way to reach you if the technician needs to call ahead?

Customer: Yeah, just this number is fine.

Agent: Great. And James, I know this is frustrating, but I want to set expectations. Once the technician gets there and we identify the issue, it should be a pretty quick fix. Could be a loose connector, could be something on the line. Either way, they'll take care of it.

Customer: Okay, that's... I mean, it's not ideal, but at least something's being done. So there's nothing else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: (pause) Well, you can try restarting it again later tonight before bed, just in case it reconnects on its own, but honestly, given what I'm seeing on the connection logs, I think you're going to need that technician visit. I don't want to have you keep trying stuff if it's a hardware issue.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I guess I'll be offline until tomorrow then.

Agent: Unfortunately, it looks that way. But hey, at least you've got the appointment scheduled. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's it. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone. But our tech is going to take great care of you tomorrow morning. You should be back up and running by tomorrow. Thank you for choosing Frontier, James, and sorry for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thanks. See you tomorrow.

Agent: Have a great day.
