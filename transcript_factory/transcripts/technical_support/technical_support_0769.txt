Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and router a few times but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I grab your account information real quick? What's the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And just to confirm, what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Alright, I see you're on our fiber gigabit plan in the Scottsdale area. So you mentioned you've already tried unplugging the modem and router—that's a great first step. When you plugged them back in, did you wait for all the lights to come back up before trying to connect?

Customer: Yeah, I waited. The modem lights came back on, like the power light and the internet light... I think. But I'm not really sure what I'm looking for, to be honest.

Agent: No problem, that's what I'm here for. So what color are the lights on your modem right now? Are they green, red, or maybe blinking?

Customer: Um, let me look. (pause) Okay, so the power light is solid green. But the internet light is... it's kind of orange? Or amber? It's definitely not green.

Agent: Okay, so that amber light on the internet port—that typically indicates either a connection issue or the modem's still syncing. How long has it been since you plugged it back in?

Customer: Maybe twenty minutes? Maybe a little less.

Agent: Alright, so it should definitely be done syncing by now. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm actually not seeing an active connection from your modem. It looks like it went offline about an hour and fifteen minutes ago. Do you have any idea what might've happened? Like, did there happen to be a storm in your area, or did you lose power at all?

Customer: No, no storms. Power's been fine. It just... stopped working. One minute I was checking email and the next minute, nothing.

Agent: Okay. Well, let me try a couple more things. Can you tell me if you see a reset button on the modem? It's usually a small button that's recessed into the modem.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's like, really tiny.

Agent: Perfect. What I need you to do is hold that reset button down for about ten seconds. This is going to clear everything out, so it might take a few minutes to reboot completely. Go ahead and do that when you're ready.

Customer: Okay, I'm holding it down... and... (pause) It's rebooting. The lights are doing that spinning thing now.

Agent: Great. And just so you know, when it finishes, the lights are going to go through a cycle of colors—that's completely normal. Should take about three to five minutes. While we're waiting, let me just ask—have you had any issues with your service recently? Any outages or anything?

Customer: Not that I can think of. It's been working pretty good actually. This is the first real problem I've had.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. (pause) So we're looking at about... two more minutes. How's it looking on your end? Any changes to the lights?

Customer: Um, they're still blinking. Different colors now. Green and amber mostly.

Agent: That's right on schedule. Should be another minute or so. (pause) Alright, does it look like they're stabilizing now?

Customer: Yeah, actually, I think... okay, the power light is solid green again. And the internet light is... still kind of amber though.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, that's not quite what we want to see. Try connecting to the WiFi from your phone or computer—can you do that real quick?

Customer: (pause) (background noise—typing) Yeah, so I'm looking at the WiFi networks and I see "Frontier-XXXXX" popping up like normal, but when I try to connect, it just says unable to connect.

Agent: Alright, so the modem is broadcasting the signal but it's not actually connecting to the internet. That amber light is telling me the same thing. Let me check the line status again. (typing sounds) (longer pause) James, I'm checking on my end and I'm not seeing a signal coming from your location at all. It's possible there could be an issue with the line itself, or there might be an outage in your area that we're not fully aware of yet.

Customer: Oh man, really? What does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. Sometimes we have underground line issues, or occasionally there's an outage that's still propagating through our system. Can I ask—do you have any outdoor equipment? Like, do you see a gray box on the outside of your house or anything like that?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually, I think I do. It's like, on the side of the house.

Agent: Okay, that's your network terminal. Can you go take a look at it and tell me if there are any lights on it, or if anything looks out of place? Obviously be careful out there.

Customer: Okay, give me one second. (background noise fades, sound of door opening) Alright, I'm looking at it. It's got... (pause) a green light on it. That's it, just one green light.

Agent: One solid green light?

Customer: Yeah.

Agent: Okay, that's actually good. That means the line itself is active. So we're back to focusing on the modem. Let me try something else. Can you unplug the modem one more time and just tell me what model number you see on the sticker? It's usually on the back.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I'm looking... it says... "Quantum Gateway E31T2V1."

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got that. Let me try restarting your modem from my end. (pause) Alright, I'm sending a command right now... (pause) Can you tell me if anything's happening?

Customer: Um... the lights just went off and then came back on. Is that what's supposed to happen?

Agent: Yeah, that's what I triggered. Just let it boot back up again. This might take another few minutes.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... so the lights are cycling again... (pause) ...and it's still amber.

Agent: Still amber. Okay. (pause) James, I want to be honest with you—I've walked through our standard troubleshooting and the modem is continuing to show that amber light and not connecting to the internet. There's definitely something preventing the connection on our end. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to your location to physically check the line and the equipment.

Customer: Seriously? How long is that going to take?

Agent: Well, let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm showing we can get someone out there tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or the day after tomorrow in the afternoon. Which works better for you?

Customer: Ugh, tomorrow morning I guess. I really need this working.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get that scheduled for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so we have a technician appointment for tomorrow, James, between 8 and noon at your address. We'll send you a confirmation text and email with all the details. The technician will be able to check the line, test the modem, and get everything back up and running for you.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate it. Anything I should do in the meantime?

Agent: Just leave the modem and router plugged in and in the same state they're in. Don't do any more resets or unplugging, just let them be. And if by some miracle it comes back on before tomorrow, just give us a quick call back. But if not, the tech will take care of it.

Customer: Okay, thanks Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, well I appreciate your patience, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. You should be all set for tomorrow morning. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
