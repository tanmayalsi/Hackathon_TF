# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried restarting my router and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm showing an account for... is this Robert Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. And just to confirm, you're at 412 Maple Street?

Customer: Yep, that's the one.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned you've already tried restarting the router. When you restarted it, did you unplug it for about 30 seconds?

Customer: Well, I just... I turned it off and turned it back on. Does that make a difference?

Agent: Actually, yes, it does. When you just power cycle it, sometimes the modem and router need a full reset. Let me walk you through that. Go ahead and unplug the router from the power outlet.

Customer: Okay, doing it now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds. While we're waiting, let me ask you—do you have a modem as well, or is it all in one unit?

Customer: Um, I think it's all in one? It's the white box that Frontier installed when I set up my service about six months ago.

Agent: Okay, so that's the gateway unit. That's helpful. Go ahead and wait... and now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's plugged back in. The lights are starting to come back on. (pause) Okay, they're... they're mostly on now.

Agent: Good, good. Now let me have you try connecting to the internet. Can you try opening a web page or something?

Customer: Yeah, let me try... (pause, typing sounds) No, it's still not working. It's like... the connection icon is still red, or not red, but just... it's not connected. I'm not getting anything.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm not showing any active service interruptions in your area, which is good news. Let me check your modem status. (pause) I'm seeing that your modem is online on our end, so that's a good sign.

Customer: So... so my modem is working but I can't connect?

Agent: Right, so the gateway itself is communicating with our network, which is good. The issue might be with the Wi-Fi or the actual connection. Let me ask you—are you trying to connect via Wi-Fi or do you have an ethernet cable?

Customer: I'm trying Wi-Fi. I have a laptop. Should I use a cable instead?

Agent: Well, that would actually help us troubleshoot. If you can, do you have an ethernet cable nearby? We could test whether the hardwired connection works.

Customer: Um, I might have one. Let me look... (pause) Yeah, I found one. Do I just plug it directly into the box?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Plug one end into the back of the gateway and the other end into your laptop.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm plugging it in now. (pause) Hmm, still nothing. The laptop isn't recognizing the connection.

Agent: Alright, let's try a different port on the gateway. There should be a few ports on the back.

Customer: (pause) I'm trying the next one... (longer pause) Still nothing, Derek. This is weird.

Agent: I understand, Robert. Let me check something. I'm going to look at when your service was last active. (typing sounds) (pause) It looks like... okay, so your service has been flagged here. I'm seeing a note that there might be an issue with the line coming into your house.

Customer: What does that mean? Like the physical line?

Agent: It could be. When you say it went out an hour ago, did anything happen before that? Any storms, or did you notice anything unusual?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine and then... I don't know, it just stopped. (pause) There was some construction in the neighborhood yesterday, actually. Could that have something to do with it?

Agent: That's actually really helpful information. It's possible that the line was damaged during construction. Let me pull up your service notes. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing anything reported yet, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. Robert, what I'd like to do is schedule a technician to come out and check the line.

Customer: How long would that take? I work from home, so this is kind of urgent.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check availability. (pause) We have availability tomorrow morning between 8 AM and noon. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Isn't there anything sooner? Like today?

Agent: Let me check... (pause) Unfortunately, today's pretty booked up. I know it's not ideal, but that's the earliest I can get someone out there.

Customer: (frustrated) Ugh, okay. I guess I have to. Can I at least try one more thing?

Agent: Of course, yeah. What did you have in mind?

Customer: Well, I remember there was a reset button on the gateway. Like a tiny one. Should I try that?

Agent: Yes, actually, good thinking. There should be a small recessed button on the back. Just use something like a paperclip to press and hold it for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, pressing it... (pause) Alright, I'm holding it. (pause) Okay, I'm letting go. (pause) Let me wait for the lights to come back... (longer pause) Lights are on. Let me see... (pause) No, still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Alright, that didn't do it. Given what we've tried and the possible line damage, I think we definitely need a technician. This isn't something we can resolve over the phone unfortunately.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I figured. So tomorrow morning then?

Agent: Yes, tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. Can I confirm your phone number so the technician can call if they have any issues finding your place?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as my account number.

Agent: Actually, that's your account number. Let me just confirm your cell phone for the technician—do you have a different number?

Customer: Oh, it's 555-8293.

Agent: Perfect. And just to be clear, the technician will be checking the physical fiber line coming into your house and checking the gateway. If there's damage from the construction, they'll be able to repair that.

Customer: And that'll get my internet back?

Agent: Most likely, yes. But they'll assess the situation when they get there.

Customer: Alright, I guess that's all I can do. Can you send me a confirmation email or something?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm sending that to the email address on file right now. You should receive it within the next few minutes. It'll have all the details of the appointment.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: Robert, I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this today, but I really appreciate your patience in working through all these steps with me.

Customer: Yeah, no problem. I guess I'll see the technician tomorrow.

Agent: You will. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. Bye.

Agent: Bye, Robert. Have a good day.
