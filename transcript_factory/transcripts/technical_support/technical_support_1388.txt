Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls coming up this afternoon.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... (pause) it's the number you just called from, actually. 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm showing an account here for... is this James Mitchell?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, James. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router? Are they lit up at all, or is everything dark?

Customer: Um, let me look... so the modem's sitting right here. I see... okay, there's like a power light that's on, I think. It's like a white light. But everything else is kind of... nothing's blinking or anything. It's just kind of sitting there.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful. So we've got power to the modem, which is good. That white light should indicate power. Now, do you see any orange or red lights at all on the device?

Customer: No, I don't... wait, there might be something. It's hard to see from where I'm sitting. Let me get closer. (pause) Yeah, actually, there's like a reddish light on the front. It's not super bright but it's definitely there.

Agent: Okay, so if there's a red light, that typically indicates that the modem isn't connecting to our network. That could be a few different things. Let me have you try a quick restart first. Can you unplug the modem from power for me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Go ahead and wait about... let's say thirty seconds, and then plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's back on.

Agent: Perfect. Now we're going to give it about two or three minutes to boot back up and reconnect to the network. While we wait, let me ask you a few more questions. Have there been any recent storms in your area, or any construction work happening near your home?

Customer: Uh, not that I'm aware of. It's been pretty clear weather, actually. No storms or anything. Why, does that matter?

Agent: It can sometimes, yeah. Fiber lines can occasionally be affected by weather events or external damage. But if you haven't had anything like that, we'll rule that out for now. (pause) Okay, and are you on wifi or are you plugged in with an ethernet cable right now?

Customer: I'm on wifi. My laptop's on wifi.

Agent: Alright. Have you tried connecting a device directly to the modem with an ethernet cable to see if you can get a wired connection?

Customer: No, I haven't. I could try that, I guess. But I don't have a super long cable, so... I mean, the modem's kind of far from where I'm working.

Agent: That's okay. We don't need a long cable for troubleshooting purposes. Do you have one nearby, even if it's just a short one?

Customer: Yeah, I think I have one in a drawer somewhere. Hold on. (pause) [inaudible] (pause) Okay, I found one. It's like a couple feet long.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug that into one of the ethernet ports on the back of the modem and then connect your laptop to it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm plugging in... (pause) alright, it's connected. Now what?

Agent: Now let's see if your laptop recognizes the ethernet connection.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, okay. So it says it's connected to ethernet now, but... I'm not getting any internet. The connection shows as connected, but when I try to open a website, nothing's loading.

Agent: Alright, so we've got a physical connection but no data is getting through. That's useful information. Let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any active service to your modem at the moment. Did you recently miss a payment or make any changes to your account?

Customer: No, no... I paid my bill on time like I always do. I paid it last month... or two months ago? I don't think I'm behind on anything.

Agent: Okay, that's good. Let me pull up your billing here. (typing sounds) (pause) Your account looks current from my end as well. Have you checked the cable that runs from the wall to your modem? Sometimes those can come loose or get damaged.

Customer: Oh, yeah, let me look at that. (pause) It looks fine from what I can see. It's plugged in pretty snug.

Agent: Alright. Sometimes these connections can look fine but still be the culprit. Can you try unplugging that cable from the modem and plugging it back in? Make sure you hear it click into place.

Customer: Yeah, doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's back in. I definitely heard it click that time.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait another minute or two and see if we get any lights changing on the modem. While we wait, can you describe what lights you're seeing now?

Customer: Still the white power light, and... yeah, that red light is still on. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. (pause) Let me try something here. I'm going to send a signal from our end to your modem and see if we get a response. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm just... trying that now. Let me know if you see anything change.

Customer: (pause) Nope, still the same. Nothing changed.

Agent: Alright. I've got to be honest with you, James. The fact that we're not seeing any communication from your modem on our network side is concerning. It could mean a few things. There might be an issue with the modem itself, or there could be a problem on the line coming from our distribution box. I want to try one more thing before I escalate this.

Customer: Okay, what do I need to do?

Agent: Can you look at the battery backup on the side of the modem? It's kind of a separate component that's connected to the main unit. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) I'm not sure what I'm looking at. There's like a box connected to the modem...

Agent: Is it roughly the size of a small external hard drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's... that's probably it. That's connected by a cable.

Agent: Perfect. That's the battery backup. Can you unplug that component completely from the modem for me?

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now go ahead and plug the main modem power out again and wait about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) Thirty seconds... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: (pause) And you can leave the battery backup disconnected for now. Let's see if the modem boots up differently without it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's on again. Still the same lights though. (pause) Still that red light.

Agent: I figured that might be the case. James, I think at this point we need to get a technician out to your location. There's likely an issue either with the modem itself or with the line connection at your service point that I can't diagnose over the phone.

Customer: Really? How long would that take? Like I said, I've got work stuff this afternoon.

Agent: I understand. Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds) (pause) Looking at our schedule... the earliest appointment I can get you is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. I know that's not ideal, but unfortunately we don't have any same-day appointments available in your area.

Customer: (sighs) Tomorrow? I mean... I guess that's what I have to do then. Is there any chance someone can come out today?

Agent: Let me check with our dispatch team. (pause) Unfortunately, no. Tomorrow morning is the earliest we can get someone out there. But our technicians are really good at diagnosing these issues quickly, so it shouldn't take too long once they arrive.

Customer: Yeah, alright. Tomorrow morning it is then. What else do I need to do?

Agent: Nothing on your part right now. You're all set. I'm going to schedule that appointment for you tomorrow between 8 and noon. You should receive a confirmation email or text message within the next few minutes with all the details. The technician will be able to check the line coming into your house and the modem itself.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. I appreciate you trying to troubleshoot with me.

Agent: Of course, James. I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved today, but we'll definitely get you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
