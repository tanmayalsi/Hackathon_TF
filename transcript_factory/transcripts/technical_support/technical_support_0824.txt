Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm showing an account for Michael Thompson at 412 Riverside Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yep, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage right now?

Customer: Yeah, complete outage. Nothing. I've got no connection at all. I was actually in the middle of working from home when it just... went black, basically.

Agent: Okay, I understand. That's definitely frustrating, especially when you're working. Let me ask you a few questions first. Are you able to see any lights on your modem and router right now?

Customer: Um, let me go look. (background noise, walking sounds) Okay, so the modem has... it's got a red light on it. Like, it's lit up but it's red, not the normal green that it usually is.

Agent: Alright, the red light is helpful information. That usually means there's an issue with the connection coming into your home. Have you experienced any weather recently, or has anything changed with your setup?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine all day. It just kind of stopped working out of nowhere.

Agent: Okay. Let me try a couple of things here. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cord out.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, doing it now. (unplugging sound)

Agent: Good. Leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds, and while we're waiting, let me ask—have you had any service interruptions in your area recently that you're aware of?

Customer: Not that I know of, no. I mean, everything was working great this morning.

Agent: (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (plugging sound) Okay, it's back in... (waiting sounds) ...and it's... it's still showing the red light. It's not changing.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me what model modem you have? There should be a label on the top or back.

Customer: Yeah, let me... (rustling sounds) It says, uh, "Frontier Model FX-400" I think?

Agent: The FX-400, perfect. I'm pulling that up now. Okay, so the red light on that model specifically indicates no signal being received from our network. Now, this could be a few different things. Let me have you try one more troubleshooting step before we move forward. Can you power down the modem and the router? Turn them both completely off.

Customer: Both of them?

Agent: Yes, both of them. Just give them like a minute with the power off, and then turn them back on in this order—modem first, then the router about thirty seconds later.

Customer: (pause) Okay, turning them off now. (clicking sounds) Both are off. I'm gonna wait... (waiting) ...alright, powering the modem back on. (powering on sound) And waiting... and now the router. (powering on sound)

Agent: Great. Let's see what happens. Give it about ninety seconds to fully boot up.

Customer: (long pause, background noise) Okay, so... nothing. The modem still has the red light. It's not changing to green.

Agent: Still red?

Customer: Yeah, still red.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Let me check the network status in your area here. I'm looking at our system map. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages in the Riverside area where you're located. That's... that's interesting. Let me ask you this—is your modem plugged directly into the wall outlet, or is it going through a power strip?

Customer: It's through a power strip, but I've got other stuff plugged into the same one and it's all working fine.

Agent: Okay, that should be fine then. Um, let me ask about your cables. Can you check the connection between the wall and your modem? The cable coming in from outside?

Customer: (walking sounds) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. The cable looks... I mean, it looks connected. It's screwed in pretty tight.

Agent: And you don't see any damage to the cable? No pinching or anything like that?

Customer: No, it looks fine to me.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to be honest with you—the fact that we're not seeing any outages on our end, combined with the red light indicating no signal being received, suggests that there might be an issue either with the line coming into your home or potentially with a component on the modem itself. Unfortunately, that's not something I can fully diagnose over the phone.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, what do I do?

Agent: Well, I have a couple of options for you. The first option is we can schedule a technician to come out to your home. They can check the line coming in and test your modem to see if it needs to be replaced. The second option is, if you want, I can send you a replacement modem and you can try that. Sometimes it's just a faulty unit.

Customer: How long would it take to get a replacement modem?

Agent: Well, we can expedite it for you. You're looking at probably two to three business days if we send it out today. But honestly, if you need your internet working sooner, the technician might be your faster option. They could potentially be out there within the next day or two depending on availability.

Customer: (pause) What about cost? Is there a charge for any of this?

Agent: Since you're experiencing a service outage and this is on our end—or likely on our end—there would be no charge for a technician visit. Same thing with a replacement modem if that's what we end up needing.

Customer: [inaudible] ...okay. So what's the soonest a technician could come?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability. (pause) What days work best for you? Are you available tomorrow or would you prefer Thursday?

Customer: I'd prefer tomorrow if that's possible. I really need to get back online.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm looking at tomorrow's schedule. It looks like we have availability between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we also have a 1 to 5 PM window. Which would work better for you?

Customer: The afternoon window, 1 to 5 PM. That works better for my schedule.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get you scheduled for tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you down. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly, and the technician will have your phone number on file so they can call you about fifteen minutes before they arrive. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works. Um, is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: Honestly, at this point I wouldn't recommend trying anything else. I don't want you to accidentally damage something. Just... leave everything as it is and we'll have the tech take a look tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate it. Thanks for trying, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We really appreciate your patience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
