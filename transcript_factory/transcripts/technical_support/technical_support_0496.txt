Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went down this morning and I've been without service for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I'm showing an account for... James Morrison in the Tucson area, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, James. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning around three hours ago. Has anything changed with your setup recently? Any storms in your area, or did you move anything around?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I was just using it normally, and then suddenly the lights on my router just... they all went red. Well, like orange, actually. And nothing's loading.

Agent: Okay, so the lights on your router are showing orange. That usually indicates a connection issue. Let me have you try a few things with me real quick. First, can you unplug your modem for me? That's the device that comes in from the wall.

Customer: The modem? Um... (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it now. Yeah, I see it. It's got the Frontier logo on it.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and unplug that from the power outlet.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged. The lights are off now.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about thirty seconds. I'm just gonna pull up some information on your account here.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, how much longer?

Agent: You can go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause, sound of plugging in) Alright, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Great. Now we're gonna wait for it to boot back up. That should take about a minute or so. While that's happening, can you tell me... have you had any issues with your internet recently? Like, has it been dropping in and out, or has this been your first time experiencing a problem?

Customer: No, no. It's been working fine. Really solid up until this morning. I mean, I've had it for like two years and never had an issue.

Agent: That's good to know. Okay, what are you seeing on the modem now? Are the lights coming back on?

Customer: (pause) Um... they're coming back on, yeah. But they're still kind of orange-ish. Not the normal white or blue or whatever they're supposed to be.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm. Okay, let me check a few things on my end. (pause) Actually, I'm not seeing any major outages in your area, so that's a good sign. Let me have you check on your router now. Is that a separate device, or is it all in one?

Customer: No, I've got a separate router. It's... (pause) yeah, it's right here next to the modem.

Agent: Okay, can you unplug the router and plug it back in as well?

Customer: You want me to do the same thing? Unplug it, wait, then plug it back in?

Agent: Exactly, yes.

Customer: (pause) Alright, unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) Waiting... (pause) And plugging it back in.

Agent: Good. Give that about thirty to sixty seconds to boot back up. While that's happening, I'm gonna check the line coming into your house. Let me just... (typing sounds) pull up your service line here.

Customer: Is something wrong with the line?

Agent: Let me just verify here. (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any issues on the line itself. The signal levels all look good. But I am noticing something here...

Customer: What? What is it?

Agent: (pause) Actually, let me ask you something. Where is your modem physically located? Is it near any windows or... outside walls?

Customer: It's in my bedroom. It's on like, a shelf next to the window. Why? Is that a problem?

Agent: Well, it shouldn't be, but sometimes we can have issues with interference or... (pause) Actually, let me check something else. When you look at the modem now, what color are the lights?

Customer: Still orange. Well, there's like a white light, but most of them are orange or they're not on at all.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay. James, I'm gonna have you try something different. I want you to try connecting a device directly to the modem with an ethernet cable, if you have one.

Customer: Um... I'm not really sure where that is. I don't think I have one.

Agent: Do you have a computer nearby that you could use?

Customer: I've got a laptop.

Agent: Does your laptop have an ethernet port? It would be like a rectangular slot on the side or back of it.

Customer: (pause) I don't think so. It's pretty new. It just has like, USB ports and stuff.

Agent: Okay, that's alright. Let's try something else then. Let me have you restart your modem one more time using the reset button instead.

Customer: The reset button? How do I... where is that?

Agent: It's usually a small button on the back or bottom of the modem. You might need a paperclip or something thin to press it in. Hold it for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the back. (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's a small hole here.

Agent: That's it. Go ahead and hold a paperclip or something in there for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright, holding it... (pause) ...still holding... (pause) Okay, I released it.

Agent: Good. Now let's give that a minute to reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay. How long is this gonna take? I've been without internet all day and I really need to get back online.

Agent: I understand, and I'm gonna do everything I can to get you back up and running. So... (pause) Now that the modem is resetting, I want to check one more thing. Can you go look at where the cable comes in from outside? Is there any visible damage to it?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Um, I'm looking outside. There's like a box on the side of the house. The cable's going into that. I don't see any damage, but... I mean, I don't really know what I'm looking for.

Agent: Just make sure there's no tears or anything obviously broken. Sounds like you're okay then.

Customer: Yeah, looks fine to me.

Agent: Alright. Now let's check on that modem again. Are the lights any different?

Customer: (pause) They're... they're still the same, actually. Orange and a couple white ones. (pause) Is that normal?

Agent: (typing sounds) Unfortunately, no. Let me... (pause) Let me try one more thing here. I'm gonna send a reset command to your modem from my end. This should restart the whole thing.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, I've sent that through. Give it about two minutes to reboot. James, while we're waiting, let me ask you—have you noticed any storms or anything unusual in your area recently? Even last night?

Customer: No, nothing. It's been clear all week, I think.

Agent: Okay. Let me check on that modem one more time for you. What's the status?

Customer: Still the same. Orange lights. This is really frustrating. Is there something seriously wrong with it?

Agent: (pause) I'm not entirely sure at this point. Let me check our system one more time. (typing sounds) (long pause) I'm looking at your account, and I'm actually seeing something that might be the issue.

Customer: What? What are you seeing?

Agent: Well, there doesn't appear to be any signal coming through to your modem at all. The line itself looks fine, but the equipment isn't registering any connectivity from our network.

Customer: So what does that mean? What do I do?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be an issue with the modem itself, or there could be something on the line between your house and our connection point. Unfortunately, I'm not able to fully diagnose this remotely. 

Customer: Does that mean I need a technician to come out?

Agent: (pause) Yes, I think at this point that would be the best course of action. I wish I could resolve this over the phone, but with no signal reaching the modem at all, I think we need to get someone out there to physically check the line and your equipment.

Customer: How long would that take? When can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm showing we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could schedule you for Thursday afternoon between 2 and 6 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning. I really can't be without internet any longer than that.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, I've got you down for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. Is that address still 4521 Desert View Lane?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. Before we wrap up, I want to make sure you have all the information. You're all set for tomorrow morning. The technician will be there to check your line and your equipment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I mean, I hope this gets fixed tomorrow. This has been really inconvenient.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm sorry we weren't able to get it resolved today, but our technician should be able to take care of this for you. Thank you for your patience, and thanks for choosing Frontier. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's it. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day, James.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Goodbye.
