# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging everything and... I don't know, nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I'd be happy to help you get this sorted out. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Patterson. P-A-T-T-E-R-S-O-N.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. So your service went down this morning? Do you remember what time that happened?

Customer: Um, yeah, around 8:30 or so. I was working from home and I just... the internet just died. No warning or anything.

Agent: Alright, I see your account here. You're on our Fiber 100 plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Great. So let's do some basic troubleshooting here. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the modem powered on?

Customer: (pause) The modem... yeah, there's some lights on it. Um, it's got a green light and a... I think a red light? Or orange maybe?

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing a red or orange light. Do you know which light that is? There should be labels on the front.

Customer: Hold on, let me look closer. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing the green light on the "Internet" label, and then I've got an orange light on... it says "Ethernet" I think?

Agent: Alright, so the Internet light is green, which is good. That means we're getting a signal to your modem. The orange on the Ethernet is a little unusual though. Do you have an ethernet cable plugged into your modem, or are you connecting via WiFi?

Customer: I'm using WiFi, actually. So should I unplug that ethernet cable?

Agent: You could try that, yeah. That might help clear things up. Go ahead and do that for me.

Customer: (pause, rustling sounds) Okay, done. Now what?

Agent: Now let's check your WiFi. Do you see any available networks showing up on your computer or phone?

Customer: (pause) No, I... I'm not seeing the Frontier network at all. There's like three other networks from neighbors or whatever, but nothing from my modem.

Agent: Okay, that's interesting. So the modem isn't broadcasting the WiFi signal. Let's do a quick restart. I want you to unplug the power cable from the back of the modem for about 30 seconds, then plug it back in. Don't unplug anything else.

Customer: Alright, unplugging now. (pause) Okay, I'm counting... (pause, longer pause) Thirty seconds. Plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Now we're just gonna let it boot back up. That should take about two to three minutes. While we're waiting, have you had any storms in your area recently? Or any other issues before this morning?

Customer: No storms that I know of. Everything's been working fine until today. This is actually really frustrating because I have meetings this afternoon and...

Agent: I totally understand. Yeah, that's rough. Let me check something on the account while we wait. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any outages in your area, so this looks like it might be specific to your equipment. Alright, are the lights looking any different on the modem now?

Customer: Um, yeah actually. Now I'm seeing like... more lights. The Internet light is still green but there's like a blue light blinking on the top now. Is that good?

Agent: That blue light blinking is actually the WiFi indicator, so that's a good sign. It means the WiFi should be coming online. Let's try scanning for networks again.

Customer: (pause) Okay, checking now... (pause) Still nothing. I'm not seeing the Frontier network show up.

Agent: Hmm, that's strange. Okay, let me try something else. On the modem, there should be a WiFi button. It might say "WiFi" on it or it might just be a small button. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) I see a button but I'm not... I don't think it says WiFi. It's kind of small. There's a button in the back near the power cable area.

Agent: That might be a reset button, actually. Let's try the button on the front if there is one. Is there a button on the front of the modem?

Customer: Oh, yeah! Yeah, there's like a little button on the front. Should I push that?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and give that a quick press and hold it for about three seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... and... (pause) Nothing's really changing that I can see.

Agent: Alright. So we've tried restarting and pressing the WiFi button. Let me ask you this—do you have a computer or laptop you could connect via ethernet cable just to test if the internet is actually working? It would help us figure out if this is a WiFi issue or a broader connection issue.

Customer: I... I might have an ethernet cable somewhere, but I'm not sure where it is. I haven't used one in years.

Agent: [inaudible] ...check around if you don't mind. Maybe in a closet or a drawer?

Customer: (pause, sound of drawers opening) Yeah, hold on. (longer pause) Okay, I found one. It's a little dusty but it should work, right?

Agent: Should be fine, yeah. Go ahead and plug one end into the modem and the other end into your laptop.

Customer: (pause, rustling) Okay, it's plugged in. Now what?

Agent: Now try opening a browser and seeing if any websites load.

Customer: (pause) Let me try... (pause) No, it's not working. It's just... it says it can't connect. It says "no internet connection."

Agent: Okay, so that tells me the issue might be with the modem itself or the signal coming in from outside. Let's try one more thing. I'm gonna have you look at the back of the modem where the cables come in. Do you see where the internet cable—it kind of looks like a phone cable but thicker—where that plugs into the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's connected.

Agent: Can you unplug that and plug it back in? Sometimes it just needs to reseat properly.

Customer: (sounds of unplugging and plugging) Alright, done. (pause) Still the same though. Still no connection.

Agent: (sigh) Okay. At this point, I'm thinking we might be dealing with an issue with the modem itself, or possibly an issue with the line coming into your house. Since you're not getting internet signal at all, and we're not seeing any outages in your area, I think we need to get a technician out to take a look.

Customer: How long would that take? Like I said, I really need my internet working.

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds, brief hold music) Okay, so I'm showing we have availability tomorrow between 12 PM and 4 PM, or the day after that we have a morning slot from 8 AM to 12 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon? That's... can't you get someone out today?

Agent: Unfortunately, I'm not showing any same-day availability in your area at the moment. Tomorrow afternoon is our soonest option. The technician will be able to diagnose whether it's the modem, the line, or something else.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Tomorrow afternoon then. That's not ideal but...

Agent: I understand. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing) Alright, you're all set for tomorrow, 12 PM to 4 PM window. You should get a confirmation text or email shortly. And just so you know, there's no charge for the service call since this appears to be something on our end.

Customer: Okay, thanks. So I just... I have no internet until then?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. Unless you can use a mobile hotspot from your phone or something like that? But as far as your home internet goes, yeah, it'll be down until the technician gets there and fixes it.

Customer: Alright. Well, I appreciate your help, even though we couldn't get it working.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. The technician tomorrow will definitely be able to help. Is there anything else I can do for you before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. You have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
