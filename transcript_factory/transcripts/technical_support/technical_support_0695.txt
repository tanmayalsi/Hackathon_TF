# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went out like an hour ago and I've tried unplugging everything and... I don't know, I'm not really tech-savvy with this stuff, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I also get your name for verification?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got your account here. I see you're on our fiber gigabit plan in the Scottsdale area, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So when you say the internet went out, do you have any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) The modem has like a red light on it. The router—I'm not even sure which one is which, honestly.

Agent: (chuckles) That's okay, that's totally normal. So the red light on the modem is usually what we want to check. Is it a solid red or is it blinking?

Customer: It's... it's blinking. Red and kind of steady blinking.

Agent: Okay, that typically means the modem is trying to sync with our network but it's having trouble connecting. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. And while that's unplugged, can you also unplug your router?

Customer: The other box?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Any other box that might be connected.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugged. Should I wait like... how long?

Agent: Yeah, let's wait about 30 seconds. Just give the equipment time to fully power down.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been a bit.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug the modem back in first. That's the one that should have come with Frontier.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged in. Now what?

Agent: Now let's wait for it to boot up. You should see some lights start to come on. Can you tell me when the lights stop changing?

Customer: (long pause) Um, the lights are... there's a blue light now. And a green light. Is that good?

Agent: That's a really good sign. The blue light usually means power, and green typically means a good connection. Let's plug the router back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's in.

Agent: Great. Give that a minute or two to fully boot up as well. While we're waiting, have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, first time really. The internet's been pretty solid since we got it installed like six months ago.

Agent: That's good to know. (pause) Okay, so do you have any devices nearby that can connect to your WiFi? A phone or a laptop?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my phone right here.

Agent: Perfect. Can you try connecting to your WiFi network and let me know if you're able to get a connection?

Customer: (pause) Let me look at the WiFi networks... I see my network name. Trying to connect now... (longer pause) Hmm, it's asking for the password.

Agent: That's normal. It should be on the back of your router or possibly on the modem.

Customer: (pause) Found it. Entering it now... (pause) Okay, it says connected, but like... nothing is loading. I tried to go to Google and it's just stuck.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm, okay. So you're connected to the WiFi but you're not getting internet access. Let me check a few things on my end here. (pause) David, I'm not seeing any outages in your area right now, and your account is showing active service, so the issue is likely with your equipment or the line coming into your house.

Customer: Okay, so what do we do?

Agent: Let me ask you a few more questions. When you look at the modem right now, is that green light still solid?

Customer: (pause) Um, actually it looks like it might be flickering now. Like, not solid anymore.

Agent: Okay, that's not ideal. That could indicate an intermittent connection issue. Have you noticed any damage to the cable that comes into your house? Any splits or kinks?

Customer: I... not that I can see. It just comes in through the wall in my office.

Agent: Alright. And this might sound simple, but just to cover all our bases—have you tried restarting your phone? Sometimes the device can hold onto connection info.

Customer: Yeah, let me try that real quick. (pause) Restarting now... (longer pause) Okay, it's back on. Trying to reconnect to WiFi... (pause) Same thing. Connected to the network but no internet.

Agent: (sigh) Alright. Unfortunately, given that we're still seeing that flickering green light and you're not able to get internet access even after the restart, this is pointing to either a line issue or a deeper modem problem. 

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It means we're probably going to need a technician to come out to your home and check the physical line connection and possibly replace the modem. Let me see what our availability looks like...

Customer: How long would that take? I work from home and I really need internet.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our schedule. (typing sounds) (pause) It looks like our earliest available appointment would be... tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I guess I can make that work. Can't really do much without internet anyway.

Agent: I appreciate your flexibility. I'm going to go ahead and schedule that technician visit for you. A tech will come out tomorrow, and they'll be able to diagnose exactly what's going on and get you back online. 

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: You should receive a confirmation email and possibly a text with the appointment details. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's... I mean, hopefully the tech can just fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I certainly hope so too. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone, but the technician will definitely take good care of you. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, David. Have a good day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Take care. (call ends)
