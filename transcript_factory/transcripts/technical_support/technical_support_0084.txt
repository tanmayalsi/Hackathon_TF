Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, my name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I need to get it back up and running. I work from home and this is really not ideal right now.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're on our Gigabit Fiber plan. And when you say your internet is down, do you mean you're not getting any connection at all, or is it just running really slow?

Customer: No, nothing. The modem... I don't even think it's turning on. There's no lights on it or anything. It's just dead.

Agent: Alright, okay. That's helpful information. Let's start with the basics. Can you check the power cable going into the modem and make sure it's securely plugged in? Sometimes these things can come loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. It's definitely plugged in. I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, but... nothing. The thing won't light up at all.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Is the power outlet itself working? Like, do you have anything else plugged into that outlet that you can confirm is working?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I have a lamp on the same power strip. Let me check... (pause) Yeah, the lamp is on, so power's definitely getting to the outlet.

Agent: Good, that rules that out. Okay, so I'm going to ask you to try something. Let's do a hard reset on the modem. What I need you to do is unplug it from the power outlet, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. While we're waiting, let me check your line here to see if there's anything on our end.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now... (pause) ...alright, 30 seconds is up. Plugging it back in. (pause) Hmm... still nothing. No lights coming on at all.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any issues on our network side. Everything looks normal for your connection. It's really sounding like this might be a hardware issue with the modem itself. Let me ask you—how long have you had this modem?

Customer: Uh, probably... I'd say about three years? Maybe a little longer?

Agent: Okay, and has it been working fine up until this morning? No issues before that?

Customer: No, it was working perfectly fine yesterday. I was actually using it last night. I just woke up and it wouldn't come on.

Agent: Alright. Um, one more thing I want to try. Can you check the back of the modem and see if there's a small reset button? It might be recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something to press it.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's a tiny button back here. Do I press it?

Agent: Go ahead and press it and hold it for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) ...okay, holding it... (longer pause) Nothing. Still completely dark.

Agent: Yeah, I was afraid of that. Based on what we've tried here, and the fact that there's no power indication at all, even after the reset, it really sounds like the modem itself has failed. This can happen, unfortunately. Modems do have a lifespan, and yours might have just reached the end of its.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, am I just out of luck here?

Agent: No, no, don't worry. We can definitely help you out. We have a couple of options. The first option is we can ship you a replacement modem. That typically takes about 3 to 5 business days to arrive. Or, if you need internet sooner, you could visit one of our local Frontier stores and pick up a replacement today, depending on your area.

Customer: (sighs) Three to five days though? That's... that's really not going to work for me. I have client meetings scheduled for tomorrow. Can I pick one up today?

Agent: That's definitely the best option for your situation then. Let me just look up where your nearest Frontier store location is. (typing sounds) Okay, looks like you have a location about twelve minutes from you on Maple Street. They're open until 6 PM today. Do you want me to give you the address and phone number?

Customer: Yeah, that would be great.

Agent: (pause) Okay, it's 847 Maple Street, and the phone number is 555-0198. Just mention that you need a replacement modem and they should be able to get you taken care of pretty quickly. When you get the new modem, the installation is the same as before—just plug it in, and it should connect automatically to your service.

Customer: Okay, got it. And just to confirm, I won't be charged for the replacement, right? Since it died on its own?

Agent: That's a great question. Typically we do charge for replacement modems if they're past the initial equipment period, but given that yours has been with you for three years and failed unexpectedly, let me make a note on your account here. (typing sounds) When you go in, just let them know about the failure and they'll see the note. I think they should be able to help you out without a charge, but I want to be honest—that would be up to the store manager.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I guess I'll just head over there and see what they say. But I really hope I don't get charged for this.

Agent: I understand. I've put everything in the system for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... I guess I'll just have to make the trip. Thanks for trying to help troubleshoot this.

Agent: You're welcome, and I'm sorry we couldn't get it working from here. I hope you're able to get that replacement modem and get back online quickly. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: Have a good day.
