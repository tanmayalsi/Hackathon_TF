# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried restarting my router already but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm pulling that up now. One moment... Okay, I've got your account here. It looks like you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Phoenix area. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned you already tried restarting your router. When you powered it back on, did you see any lights come on?

Customer: Um, yeah. The power light is on, the WiFi light is on, but... I don't think the internet light is on. It's usually blue and now it's... it's not lit up at all.

Agent: Okay, that's really helpful information. That indicator light tells us there's no connection coming into the modem. So the first thing I want to try is checking the physical connections. Can you look behind your router and make sure all the cables are plugged in securely?

Customer: (rustling sounds) Yeah, let me... let me get back there. Okay, so I've got the power cable in, the ethernet cable from the wall... yeah, that's plugged in too.

Agent: Good. And does that ethernet cable look damaged at all? Any cracks or bends in it?

Customer: No, it looks fine to me.

Agent: Alright. What I'd like you to do now is unplug the modem completely—that's the device with all the cables—wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. That sometimes helps reset the connection.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now... (pause) ...alright, just waiting. (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) The lights are flickering. There's some activity now. Um... the blue light just came on! The internet light is on!

Agent: Oh excellent! That's a great sign. Do you want to try connecting to your WiFi now and see if you can get online?

Customer: Yeah, definitely. (pause) Okay, I'm trying to open a webpage here... (longer pause) ...no, it's not working. The light is on but I'm not getting any internet.

Agent: Hmm, okay. So you can see the WiFi network available?

Customer: Yeah, I can see the network and I'm connected to it, but nothing will load. It's just... stuck.

Agent: I see. Let me try a couple other things. First, can you tell me if you're using a separate WiFi router or is this all built into one device?

Customer: I think it's all built in. It's just one unit.

Agent: Okay, that's what I thought from your account. Let me run a line test from our end to see if we're detecting a signal coming from your location. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, that's strange. The test isn't showing an active connection on our side. It looks like the signal isn't making it all the way through the network to your home.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it a problem with my equipment?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It might be an issue with the fiber line to your house, or it could be something with the equipment. The fact that we're not detecting anything on our end suggests it might be a service issue rather than your modem. Let me try one more thing though. Can you restart the modem one more time but this time hold down the reset button on the back for about ten seconds?

Customer: Wait, reset button? Is that gonna erase my settings or anything?

Agent: It might reset your WiFi network name and password to the defaults, which would be printed on the bottom of the device. But at this point, let's try to get you back online first and then we can reconfigure it if needed.

Customer: Okay, fine. (pause) I'm looking for the reset button... it's really small. (pause) Okay, I'm holding it down... ten seconds... (pause) ...now releasing. Let me wait for it to boot back up. (pause) Okay, all the lights came back on. Same thing as before—the internet light is on but still nothing's loading. I'm still not getting a connection.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm not seeing any change on our end either. That tells me this is likely a service disruption. Let me check if there are any outages reported in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any active outages on file, which is unusual. 

Customer: So what do we do? This has never happened before.

Agent: Well, given that we're not detecting a signal on the network side, I think what we need to do is get a technician dispatched to your location. They can check the fiber line coming to your house and make sure everything's connected properly on our end.

Customer: A technician? How long is that gonna take?

Agent: Let me see what availability we have. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest I can get someone out there is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Or we have another window on Friday afternoon if that works better for you.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works, I guess. I really need this fixed soon.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get you scheduled for tomorrow morning. I'm gonna set that up for you now. (typing sounds) You're all set for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. The technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive. Your confirmation number is 447829. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Hopefully the tech can figure this out.

Agent: I'm sure they will. I do apologize that we weren't able to get you back online today. Is there anything else before we end this call?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow!

Customer: Alright, bye.

Agent: Goodbye!
