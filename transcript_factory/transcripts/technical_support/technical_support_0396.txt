Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, my name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because my internet just went out completely. It's been down for like... I don't know, maybe two hours now? And I really need to get it working.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're on our fiber service in... Henderson area, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So your internet is completely down right now? Are you able to see any lights on your router or modem?

Customer: Um, let me check. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. The modem has... there's one light that's on but it's red. The others are off, I think.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing a red light. That typically indicates there's no connection to our network. Have you had any storms in your area recently, or any other outages that you're aware of?

Customer: No, not really. It was working fine this morning when I left for work. I just got home like an hour and a half ago and realized it was down.

Agent: Understood. Well, let's try a few things here. The first thing I'm going to suggest is doing a power cycle of your modem. Can you unplug it for me?

Customer: Yeah, give me a second. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. I'll wait.

Customer: (pause) Alright, thirty seconds... (pause) Should be good now.

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in. We'll give it a minute or so to boot back up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) I'm seeing... the lights are starting to come on now.

Agent: Good, that's what we want to see. Are you seeing any green lights at all?

Customer: (pause) There's a green light on the left side here. But I'm still seeing red on the other side.

Agent: Okay, and how many lights are we looking at total on the modem?

Customer: There's like... four or five lights I think. Um, one green on the left, the rest are either red or off.

Agent: Alright, so one green is actually good. That means there's some activity. Let me just... (typing sounds) give me one moment. I'm going to check if there are any known outages in your area.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) I'm not showing any major outages in Henderson right now. That's interesting. Um, so you mentioned the internet was working this morning?

Customer: Yeah, it was definitely working. I was checking email and everything before I went to work.

Agent: Okay. And you didn't restart it or unplug anything since this morning?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I didn't touch anything.

Agent: Alright. Let me ask you this—do you have a backup battery on your modem, or is it powered directly from the wall outlet?

Customer: It's directly from the wall. Should I be using a backup battery?

Agent: Well, no, that's fine. I was just checking. (pause) Okay, so let's try another thing. I want you to do a factory reset of your modem. There should be a small reset button on the back. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Um, I'm looking... yeah, I think I see it. It's like a tiny button that's recessed, right?

Agent: Exactly. Can you grab a paper clip or something small to press it? You'll hold it for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, give me a second to find something. (rummaging sounds) Alright, I've got a pen. Let me press it. (pause) How long did you say?

Agent: About ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... (pause) ...and releasing. (pause) Now what?

Agent: Now we'll let it reboot again. This might take a couple of minutes. While that's happening, can you tell me—have you noticed any flickering lights on your modem recently? Or any unusual behavior before it went down?

Customer: No, not really. It's been pretty solid. No flickering or anything. This is the first time anything like this has happened since we got the service like... six months ago?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. (pause) Are you seeing any changes in the lights now?

Customer: (pause) Um, not really. It's still pretty much the same. Still got that red light and the one green one.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Let me try something different. I'm going to check the line coming into your house. Can you tell me where your network box is located? Is it outside or inside?

Customer: Outside. It's on the side of the house.

Agent: Okay. And you don't need to go check it right now, but have you noticed if there's a cable that looks disconnected or anything?

Customer: No, I haven't seen anything like that. Everything looks like it's been fine from what I can see.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at the diagnostics here, and I'm showing that we're not getting a signal from your modem at all. That's unusual. (pause) Um, I think what might be happening here is there could be an issue with either the fiber line coming into your house or possibly the modem itself.

Customer: Oh. So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, unfortunately, we're going to need to send a technician out to check everything. But before we do that, let me try one more thing. Can you hold for just a quick second? I want to run this past my supervisor.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause)

Agent: (brief hold music) (pause) Okay, I'm back. So I've got a few options here. We can schedule a technician visit—that would be probably the best route to figure out exactly what's going on. Or... (pause) actually, no, I think a tech visit is definitely what we need here.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) We actually have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be best. I need the internet back as soon as possible.

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you down for tomorrow, 8 to 12 PM. A technician will come out and check the line, the connection box, and your modem. If it's the modem, we can swap it out right then and there.

Customer: Okay, great. Is there anything I need to do in the meantime? Like, should I keep trying things or just leave it?

Agent: Just leave it unplugged for now, actually. And make sure you have someone home tomorrow morning to let the technician in. Before they leave, they'll make sure everything is working properly.

Customer: Got it. (pause) So I'll just see them tomorrow then.

Agent: Exactly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're very welcome. I apologize again for the trouble. We'll get you back online tomorrow. Thank you for calling Frontier.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
