Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing your account here. So your internet service went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 8 or 8:30. I tried unplugging the router like I usually do when stuff freezes up, but it didn't help. It's still not working.

Agent: Okay, so you've already done a restart. That's good. Let me ask you a few questions. Right now, are you looking at your modem and router? Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on them?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it now. Um, the power light is on—that's green. But the internet light, I think it's... it's not on. It's dark.

Agent: It's completely dark?

Customer: Yeah, totally dark. Red maybe? No, wait, it might be blinking red. It's hard to see from where I'm standing.

Agent: Okay, so we're seeing a red or blinking red light on the internet indicator. That typically means the modem isn't syncing with our network. Let's try a couple of things. First, can you unplug the modem—that's the box with all the ports on it—and wait about 30 seconds, then plug it back in?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, sure. (background noise of rustling) Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Alright, I'm waiting... (longer pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. While that's booting back up, can I ask—have you experienced any service interruptions in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, no. It's been working great. This is the first time in like... I don't know, months? It just stopped working this morning out of nowhere.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our system real quick. (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area at the moment, so that's good news. What we might be looking at is either a connection issue on the line or a modem issue. How's the modem looking now?

Customer: (pause) It's... still red. Maybe getting a little dimmer? I don't know if that's a good sign.

Agent: Sometimes it takes a minute or two to fully boot up, so let's give it another 20 seconds or so. In the meantime, let me ask—when you plugged it back in, did you also restart the router separately?

Customer: Oh, um... no. Should I?

Agent: Yeah, let's do that. That's the smaller box. Go ahead and unplug that one and wait about 30 seconds as well.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Thirty seconds... (pause) Alright, plugging back in. (pause) How long before we know if it's working?

Agent: Give it another minute or so to sync up. Should be pretty quick after that. While we're waiting, I'm going to check your line here on my end. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm running a line test... (pause) Hmm, that's interesting.

Customer: What? What's interesting?

Agent: Well, the line is showing as active on our end, but I'm not seeing a strong signal coming from your equipment. That could mean a few things—it could be the modem itself, or it could be a connection issue between your house and our network.

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: Let me ask—are there any loose cables anywhere? Sometimes if a cable gets disconnected or isn't fully plugged in, we'll see this exact situation.

Customer: (pause) I mean, I don't think so. Let me look behind here. (rustling) There's a cable going into the back... looks pretty secure. There's another one... (pause) these all look fine to me.

Agent: Okay. How about the cable that comes into your house from outside? Do you have any visibility to that?

Customer: Uh, not really. It comes in through a wall. I'd have to go outside.

Agent: I know it's not ideal, but would you be able to take a quick look? Just to see if anything looks obviously disconnected or damaged?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess. Give me a second. (background noise fades, then returns after a longer pause) Okay, I'm back. It looks... fine? It's definitely plugged in. I don't see anything wrong with it.

Agent: Alright, good. And checking back on your modem and router—any change with those lights?

Customer: (pause) The modem light is still red. The router light... I'm not even sure if the router's on. I don't see any lights on the router now that you mention it. (pause) Wait, no, there it is. There's a couple of tiny lights, but they're not bright.

Agent: Okay. Are they green, red, or...?

Customer: They're kind of... orange? Maybe amber? I'm not really sure.

Agent: That's... that's not ideal. (pause) Okay, I'm going to be honest with you—this might be a hardware issue. We might be looking at a modem failure or a router issue. Let me do this. I'm going to send a test signal from our end to see if we can get any response. (typing sounds) Give me just a moment... (pause) Okay, sending the test now.

Customer: What should I be looking for?

Agent: Actually, just keep an eye on that internet light on the modem. Sometimes when I do this, it'll flicker or respond in some way.

Customer: (long pause) Nope. It's just sitting there. Still red.

Agent: Yeah, I'm not getting a response on my end either. (pause) Alright, here's what I think we're dealing with. Either your modem has gone bad, which happens sometimes, or there's a deeper issue with the line itself that we'd need to send a technician out to investigate.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, how long before I can have internet again?

Agent: Well, I can definitely schedule a technician visit for you. We've got availability... (typing sounds) looks like we could get someone out there as early as tomorrow afternoon, or we have some openings Thursday morning if that works better for you.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon? I really need this today.

Agent: (pause) I understand, and I'm sorry. Unfortunately, I don't have any same-day appointments available. Is tomorrow afternoon doable?

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Yeah, I guess it has to be. What time tomorrow?

Agent: We have a window from 1 PM to 5 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, fine. That works.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so that's tomorrow, between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will call you when they're on their way. Your confirmation number is—let me just grab that for you—it's 8847521. Can you repeat that back to me?

Customer: 884... 7521. Did I get that right?

Agent: You've got it. Alright, so just to recap—we've troubleshot the basic restart procedures, verified your line is active on our end but we're not getting proper signal from your modem. This really does look like either a hardware failure or something that needs in-person investigation. The technician tomorrow will be able to diagnose it properly and get you up and running.

Customer: Okay. And if it's the modem, like, is that going to cost me?

Agent: Great question. If the modem is defective, we can replace it at no charge under your service agreement. You shouldn't have any out-of-pocket costs.

Customer: Alright, that's good. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. I'm sorry I couldn't get it resolved over the phone for you. But we'll get you sorted out tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Sounds good. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Yep, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
