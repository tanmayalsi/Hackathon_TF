# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it working—I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: Great, Michael. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) Okay, I've got you. So you're saying your internet's been down since this morning? Do you have any lights on your modem right now?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually. There's a red light on it. It's been red since, I don't know, around 8 AM or so.

Agent: Okay, a red light typically indicates either a connection issue or a problem with the device itself. Let's try a few things. First, can you locate your modem and router for me?

Customer: Yeah, they're right here on my desk. I've got them both.

Agent: Perfect. What I'd like you to do is unplug the modem first—that's the device with all the ports on the back—and just wait about 30 seconds, then plug it back in.

Customer: Alright, unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we're waiting, do you remember when you last had a working connection? Was it last night?

Customer: Yeah, it was working fine last night. Everything was normal. I just woke up this morning and tried to check my email and nothing was loading.

Agent: Got it. And you haven't made any changes to the setup or moved anything around?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Everything's been the same.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and plug that modem back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Good. Now, can you tell me what lights you're seeing? Are they all off right now?

Customer: Uh, they're all off actually. Just completely dark.

Agent: That's normal for the first few seconds. It'll take maybe 30 to 60 seconds to boot up. While it's starting, let me check your account on my end here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, and your account looks active. So once that modem boots up, we should see if we get a solid light.

Customer: Okay, good. Um, how long should it take?

Agent: Usually about a minute or so. Just keep an eye on it. You should see the lights starting to come on—usually a power light first, then internet and other connections.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm seeing... I'm seeing the power light now. It's green and it's solid.

Agent: Excellent. And what about the internet light? Is that coming on?

Customer: Uh, the internet light is... it's kind of a yellow or orange color? It's blinking.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so a blinking yellow or orange light—that usually means it's still trying to establish a connection. Let's give it another 20 or 30 seconds to see if it turns green and becomes solid.

Customer: Yeah, I'll wait. (pause) Okay, still blinking though. Still that same color.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, let me try something else here. Can you check your router? Where's that located?

Customer: It's right next to the modem. It's the wireless one.

Agent: Perfect. Can you tell me what color the lights are on that?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... the power light is on and it's green, but everything else is pretty much dark. There's like, barely any lights on it.

Agent: Okay. And is there an Ethernet cable connecting your modem to your router?

Customer: Um, let me look. Yeah, there's a cable going from the modem to the router. It looks like it's... it's plugged in on both ends.

Agent: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you to do something. Can you unplug that Ethernet cable from the router—just the router end—and then plug it back in? Sometimes it just needs to reseat.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm unplugging it. (pause) Alright, plugging it back in... and, it's back in.

Agent: And still nothing on the other lights on the router?

Customer: No, still just the power light.

Agent: Alright, I'm going to be honest with you, Michael—the fact that the modem internet light is stuck on blinking usually means one of two things. Either there's a signal issue coming from our line, or the modem itself might be having a hardware problem. (pause) Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your modem diagnostics here and... actually, I'm seeing some errors that suggest the modem might not be communicating properly with our network.

Customer: So does that mean... what does that mean exactly?

Agent: It could mean a couple of things. It might be a temporary thing that resolves itself, but it could also indicate that the modem might need to be replaced. Before we go down that road though, let me try one more thing with you. Do you have access to a computer or phone that works with your mobile data?

Customer: Yeah, I've got my phone.

Agent: Okay, can you go ahead and turn off your WiFi on your phone? I want to make sure we're not looking at a WiFi router problem, and I'm going to restart some things on my end. This might take a couple of minutes.

Customer: Sure, WiFi is off. (pause) Now what?

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm resetting things on my end. This should take about two minutes. Just hold tight.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm waiting. Still red light on the modem? Wait, no, sorry—still blinking yellow. Sorry.

Agent: (pause, typing) Okay, I'm back. What are you seeing on the modem now?

Customer: Um, same thing. Still blinking. The power light is solid green, but that internet light is still just blinking yellow.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Yeah, Michael, I've tried resetting from this end and it doesn't seem to be making a difference. What I'm seeing in the system is that we're getting connection attempts but they're failing. This is typically a hardware issue with the modem unit itself.

Customer: So... are you saying it's broken?

Agent: It's quite possible, yes. I know that's frustrating. Look, what I can do for you is set up a technician visit, or we can arrange for us to send you a replacement modem. A replacement would probably be faster—we can usually get that out within a business day or two.

Customer: Wait, so I just have to wait for a new modem? I don't have internet at all right now. I really need this for work.

Agent: I understand completely, and I apologize for the inconvenience. The replacement process is usually pretty quick. But if you prefer, we can schedule a technician to come out and take a look at it in person. That might be able to happen sooner depending on availability.

Customer: How soon could a technician come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check what we have available. What's your availability like today or tomorrow?

Customer: Um, today would be tough, but tomorrow afternoon should work. Any time after like, 1 PM.

Agent: (pause, typing) Okay, so I'm looking at the schedule and unfortunately we don't have any same-day availability for tomorrow afternoon in your area. The earliest I'm seeing is day after tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Is that workable for you?

Customer: (pause) I really need internet sooner than that if I can.

Agent: I completely understand. So, if we do the replacement modem route, I think that would actually be faster for you. Let me process that order. We'd get that out to you, and honestly, you might have it by tomorrow or the next day, and then you'd be back up and running right away.

Customer: Okay, yeah, let's do that then. Can you overnight it or anything?

Agent: Let me see what options we have. (typing sounds, pause) Actually, I can put a priority rush on it, which should get it to you by tomorrow if we process it right now. There's no additional charge for that.

Customer: Okay, yeah, definitely do that. That would be great.

Agent: Perfect. And I'm going to need the address where you want it sent. Is that the same address on your account?

Customer: Yeah, same address is fine. 447 Maple Street, Apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing) Got it. And just to confirm, you said you need it by tomorrow, so I'm going to mark this as priority. You should receive an email confirmation shortly with tracking information. Once you get the new modem, the setup is pretty straightforward, but if you have any issues, just give us a call back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I appreciate that.

Agent: I'm sorry I couldn't get it working today, Michael. I really did try troubleshooting everything we could. But you should be back online soon.

Customer: Yeah, no, I get it. These things happen. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll just wait for the modem and hopefully get it tomorrow.

Agent: Sounds good. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your business. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
