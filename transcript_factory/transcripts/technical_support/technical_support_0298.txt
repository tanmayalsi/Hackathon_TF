# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out sometime this morning and I've tried unplugging the modem and router, but nothing's working. I really need to get this fixed—I'm supposed to be working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your phone number or account number to start?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, I'm showing this is at... 428 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Okay, great. So you mentioned you've already unplugged the modem and router. When you did that, how long did you wait before plugging them back in?

Customer: Um, I think like thirty seconds? Maybe a minute?

Agent: Alright, so ideally we want to wait about two to three minutes to let them fully power down. Let me have you try that again if you're willing. Go ahead and unplug both devices now, and we'll wait a couple minutes.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I can do that. (sound of unplugging) Okay, they're unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we're waiting, let me ask—do you have any lights on the modem right now? Are they off?

Customer: They're all off, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. And how long have you been a customer with us?

Customer: About two years, I think? Maybe a little longer. We've had pretty good service up until now.

Agent: That's good to hear. We appreciate your business. (pause) Alright, it's been about two minutes. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first, and then plug in the router after about thirty seconds.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in devices) Okay, modem's in. (pause) Router's in now too.

Agent: Excellent. And now we just need to give them a minute or two to boot back up. While they're doing that, did anything unusual happen before the internet went out? Like a storm, or did you do any work on the cable lines outside?

Customer: No, no storm or anything like that. It was just... I woke up this morning around eight and it was already gone. No warning or anything.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. (typing sounds) Alright, go ahead and take a look at your modem. You should see some lights starting to come back on. What are you seeing?

Customer: Um, yeah, I see a couple lights now. There's like a green light and... and a yellow light, I think?

Agent: Okay, good. The yellow light might just mean it's still connecting. Let's give it another thirty seconds or so and then we can check if you have internet yet. Do you want to go ahead and try opening a website on your computer?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm trying... no, it's not loading. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, let's try a few more things. Can you tell me what kind of modem you have? Is there a model number on the front or back?

Customer: Let me check... (pause) It says FrontierNet 3000 or... wait, actually I think it might be 5000? The number's kind of worn off.

Agent: That's okay. And do you see any kind of red lights on there? Like an alert light or anything that says "no connection" or—

Customer: Actually, yeah. Now that you mention it, there's like a little red light on the right side that just came on.

Agent: Okay, that could indicate a connection issue on our end. Let me check the line status here. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm seeing some unusual activity on your line. Have you noticed any flashing or anything on the modem in the last few hours before it went out?

Customer: No, not that I saw. It seemed fine when I went to bed last night.

Agent: Alright, let me try one more troubleshooting step. I'm going to have you do a factory reset on the modem. This should clear out any configuration issues. There should be a small reset button on the back—it's usually recessed in a little hole.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. Do I just... press it?

Agent: Yes, but you'll need to use something small like a paperclip or a ballpoint pen. Hold it down for about ten seconds. The modem will restart, and all the lights should go off and come back on.

Customer: Okay, give me a second. (pause) (sounds of searching) Alright, I got a pen. (pause) Holding it down now... okay, lights are going off.

Agent: Good, and we'll just let it boot back up like before. This might take a couple minutes.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... we're just waiting now?

Agent: Exactly. While we wait, can I ask—have you had any work done on the lines recently, or have there been any service visits to your house?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Well, actually, there was somebody working on the telephone pole across the street maybe a week ago? I'm not sure if that was Frontier though.

Agent: That's worth noting. Let me put a note on your account about that. (typing sounds) Alright, are you seeing the lights come back up now?

Customer: Yeah, they're starting to come on again... green light, another green light... and, um, that red light is still there.

Agent: (pause) Okay, the red light is still concerning. What we're looking at here is a signal issue. Let me check something on our backend real quick. (pause) (more typing) Unfortunately, I'm seeing what looks like a line fault on your connection. That red light typically indicates that the modem can't establish a connection to our network.

Customer: Oh no, so what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: So, unfortunately, that's usually something that would require a technician to come out and inspect the line. It could be anything from a loose connection at the junction box outside your home to a problem further down the line. The reset we did didn't resolve it, which tells me it's more of a physical infrastructure issue on our end.

Customer: So I can't fix this myself?

Agent: I don't think so, unfortunately. I've gone through the standard troubleshooting steps, and the modem seems to be working fine—it's the connection to our network that's the problem. I really do think we need to get a technician out there to take a look at the line itself.

Customer: (sighs) How long would that take? And would there be a service charge?

Agent: Let me check our availability for you. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing we have technician availability tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we have another slot on Friday morning. Since you're working from home, what works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be better than Friday. So... there's no way to get someone today?

Agent: I'm showing all our technicians are booked today, unfortunately. Tomorrow's the soonest we can get someone out. And as for the service charge—you do have standard service coverage, so if this is determined to be an issue on our end, there wouldn't be a charge. But if it's something like a customer-owned line or external issue on your property, there could be a service fee. The technician will let you know once they assess it.

Customer: Okay, I guess tomorrow works then. This is just really frustrating because I need my internet today for work.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry we're unable to resolve this over the phone. But I do think getting a technician out there is the right next step. (pause) Can I get a good phone number to reach you at tomorrow, and what time would work best?

Customer: The number you have should be fine. And anytime between 1 and 5 is okay, I'll be home.

Agent: Perfect. So I have you down for tomorrow, that's [inaudible], between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will give you a call about thirty minutes before they arrive. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Thank you for trying anyway.

Agent: Of course, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. We really do appreciate your patience, and hopefully our technician will have you back online tomorrow. You should receive a confirmation email shortly. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow!

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
