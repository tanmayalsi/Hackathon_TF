# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I've got no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you out here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... hold on... (shuffling sounds) it's 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this residential service at that number?

Customer: Yes, yeah.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. Can you tell me—when exactly did you notice the internet stopped working?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 8 or 9 this morning? I tried to check my email and nothing was loading, and then I realized the whole thing was just... down.

Agent: Alright, and have you done any troubleshooting on your end yet? Like, have you tried restarting your router?

Customer: Oh, no, I haven't. I wasn't... I mean, I wasn't sure if that would help. Where is that? The router, I mean.

Agent: No problem. So your router is probably the device that looks like a small box with antennas or lights on it. It's usually connected to the wall outlet. Do you see something like that?

Customer: (pause) Oh, okay, yeah, I see it. It's under my TV. There's like... a bunch of lights on the front of it, but they're not all lit up. Is that... normal?

Agent: Well, let me ask you this—what color are the lights that are on? And which ones are off?

Customer: Um... there's a white light, and I think a red one? The red one's blinking. Is that bad?

Agent: Okay, so a red blinking light usually indicates there's an issue with the connection. Let's do this—I want you to unplug the router from the power outlet, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. Just give me one moment while you do that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) Alright, I'm waiting. This is... (pause) ...okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Now just give it about two minutes to fully boot back up. We should see those lights stabilize. Can you tell me what you're seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Um, still mostly the same. There's more lights on now, but that red one's still blinking. It's like... it's blinking faster now, actually.

Agent: Hmm, okay. And you're not seeing any green lights come on?

Customer: No, I don't see green. Is there supposed to be green?

Agent: Yeah, typically we'd want to see a green light indicating an internet connection. Let me ask you something else—do you see any cables plugged into the back of the router?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's like two cables. One's coming from the wall and one's... I think going to my computer or something?

Agent: Okay, good. So that cable coming from the wall—can you follow it and make sure it's firmly plugged in? Sometimes these can work a little loose.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Uh, yeah, it seems pretty tight to me. I gave it a little tug and it doesn't wiggle or anything.

Agent: Alright, give me a few more seconds here. (typing sounds) Let me check if there are any outages in your area. (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end, so that's good news. Um, let me try something else. Can you tell me if there's a small reset button on the router? It might be recessed.

Customer: A reset button? Like... (pause) I don't know, I see like a little hole on the back here. Is that it?

Agent: That could be it, yeah. But before we do a full reset, I don't want to lose your settings. Let me try one more thing first. Do you have a modem? That would be a separate device, usually a little smaller than the router, and it would be connected to the router with a cable.

Customer: (pause) Um... I'm not... I'm not sure? I thought the router was the modem?

Agent: No, that's a common thing. So they're actually two separate devices, but sometimes they can be combined into one. But given what you're describing, I think they might be separate in your case. Let me ask—is there another device, maybe a little box near your router?

Customer: (pause) Oh! Yeah, yeah, I think I see it. There's another box that's like silver-colored, and it's got some cables coming out of it.

Agent: Perfect. That's likely your modem. Okay, I want you to do the same thing with the modem—unplug it, wait 30 seconds, and plug it back in. And this time, let's wait about three minutes for it to fully come back online.

Customer: Okay... (pause, sounds of movement) ...unplugging... waiting... (long pause) ...alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Good. Now we wait. Take your time. (pause) While we're waiting, let me ask—have you experienced any outages or issues like this before with your Frontier service?

Customer: No, no, this is the first time something like this has happened. I've had pretty good service actually. So this is just... weird.

Agent: Well, that's good to hear. Most of the time these kinds of issues resolve with a simple restart. Okay, it's been about three minutes. What are you seeing on the modem now?

Customer: (pause) Um, the lights are... they're lit up differently than before? I see like a white light, and there's like a blinking green one now, maybe?

Agent: Okay, a blinking green is progress. Now check the router again. Are you seeing any green lights on there?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. Just the white one and that red blinking light.

Agent: Still the red? (pause) Alright, that's... hmm. Okay, let me think about this. (typing sounds) Are you able to go ahead and restart the router one more time? And this time, after you plug it back in, let's wait a full five minutes.

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, sure. Unplugging it again... (pause) ...waiting... (long pause) ...okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Perfect. So while we wait, let me just pull up a few more diagnostics on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm seeing... hmm. I am actually seeing that your modem is showing some unusual activity. It's cycling on and off more than it should be.

Customer: What does that mean? Is something broken?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It might be an issue with the modem itself, or it could be an issue with the line coming into your home. (pause) Let me ask you this—have there been any recent storms or any work done outside your house?

Customer: (pause) Um, no storms that I know of. There was like... actually, now that you mention it, there were some workers from the city or something out on the street yesterday. They might've been digging or something? I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention.

Agent: Ah, okay. That could definitely be related. Sometimes line work can affect the connections. Let me just... (typing sounds) ...check a few more things. How long has it been on the router?

Customer: Maybe like four or five minutes?

Agent: Alright, let's check it now. What are you seeing?

Customer: (pause) It's... pretty much the same as before. White light, red blinking light. The green light didn't come back like it did on the modem.

Agent: (pause) Okay, um... Let me be honest with you here. It's looking like there might be an issue with the line itself, or potentially with your modem. Given that there was work done on the street yesterday, it's possible that something got damaged or disconnected.

Customer: So like... what do I do? Can you fix it remotely or...?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, from what I'm seeing, I don't think this is something I can resolve remotely. I'm going to need to schedule a technician to come out and physically check your modem and the line connection. They'll be able to diagnose exactly what's going on.

Customer: (frustrated) So I'm going to be without internet until then? How long is that going to take?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) I can get someone out there as early as... tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Or if you need it sooner, we do have emergency service, but that would be later today, around 5 to 7 PM.

Customer: (pause) I... I guess tonight sometime? I really need to get this working.

Agent: I appreciate that. Let me get you scheduled for our emergency service window. That would be between 5 and 7 PM today. Can you confirm that works for you?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that's fine. I'll be here.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so I have you scheduled for today, 5 to 7 PM. The technician will call you about 15 minutes before they arrive. Your appointment confirmation number is 892447. Do you have somewhere to write that down?

Customer: Um, yeah, hold on... (shuffling sounds) ...okay, go ahead.

Agent: It's 892447.

Customer: Got it. 892447. Okay.

Agent: Great. And I'm going to put a note on your account about the street work yesterday, so the technician will be aware of that when they arrive. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's everything. Thank you for trying to fix it, I guess.

Agent: Of course. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working remotely, but our technician should be able to take care of it for you this evening. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day.
