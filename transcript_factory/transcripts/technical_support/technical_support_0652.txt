# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back up. I've tried restarting the router and everything, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm showing... let's see... that's an account under Michael Torres?

Customer: That's me, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing no internet connectivity at all right now?

Customer: Right, nothing. My computer's not connecting, my phone won't connect to the wifi... I mean, I'm calling you on my cell, but it's just cellular data. The whole thing's down.

Agent: Understood. And you mentioned you already restarted the router—that's great, that's usually the first step. Um, when you look at the router right now, what lights are you seeing on it?

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me go look... (background noise of footsteps) So I've got... there's a power light that's on, it's green. Then there's a couple other lights that are just... they're off, I think.

Agent: Okay, which lights are off? Are you seeing one for internet or wifi or...?

Customer: Uh... (pause) there's like an internet light and a wifi light, and yeah, they're both dark. Not lit up at all.

Agent: Alright, that actually tells me something. The internet light being off suggests the router isn't receiving a signal from our network. Before we go further, let me just check on our end if there are any outages in your area. Can I ask what city you're in?

Customer: I'm in Boise, off Bogus Basin Road.

Agent: (typing sounds) Boise, got it. Let me check the outage map real quick... (pause) Okay, I'm not showing any active outages in your area at the moment, so it shouldn't be a widespread issue.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it my equipment?

Agent: It could be a few things. Let's try some troubleshooting. Can you locate the modem? That's the device that should be separate from the router, usually has more ports on it.

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) I think it's downstairs. Let me go grab it. Hold on.

Agent: No problem, take your time.

Customer: (long pause with background noise) Okay, I'm looking at it now.

Agent: Great. And what lights are you seeing on the modem?

Customer: So the power light is green, same as the router. But um... I've got a light that says "Online" and that one's red. Is that bad?

Agent: Yeah, that red Online light tells us the modem isn't connecting to our network. Okay, let's try a hard reset on the modem. Do you see a small button, like a reset button, maybe slightly recessed?

Customer: (pause) There's a tiny button on the back... is that it?

Agent: That's probably it, yeah. With the modem still plugged in, I want you to hold that button down for about ten seconds.

Customer: Okay, holding it... (pause) ...ten seconds. Okay, I'm letting go.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about two to three minutes to boot back up and re-establish the connection. While we wait, can I ask—when did this start exactly?

Customer: This morning, yeah. I woke up and tried to check my email and nothing. I didn't hear anything unusual last night or anything.

Agent: Okay. Any storms in the area recently?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear. I mean, it rained a couple days ago, but nothing since.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Okay, let's check that modem again. What's the Online light showing now?

Customer: (pause) Um... still red.

Agent: Still red. Okay. (pause) And the power light is still green?

Customer: Yes, power's still green.

Agent: Alright, let me try something else. Can you check the cable connections on the modem? There should be a cable coming in from outside, usually it's a coaxial cable, kind of thick?

Customer: Yeah, there's a cable... (pause) ...it looks connected to me. It's pretty snug.

Agent: Okay, can you unplug it and plug it back in, just to make sure it's got a good connection?

Customer: (background noise) Okay, unplugging it... and... plugging back in.

Agent: Good. Let's give it another minute or so for the modem to recognize that.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. The light's still red.

Agent: Yeah, I'm not seeing a change on my end either. Um... (pause) Let me check something. Are you still seeing that green power light on the modem?

Customer: Yeah, the power light is fine, it's just the Online light that's red.

Agent: Right. Okay, Michael, I'm going to be honest with you—the fact that the modem power is on but it's not connecting to our network, and there's no outage on our end, typically means either there's a line issue outside your house or there's a problem with the modem itself that might need to be replaced.

Customer: Oh man, really? So what do we do?

Agent: Well, I'd recommend we set up a technician to come out and check the line and the equipment. They can do a full diagnostic and get you back online.

Customer: How soon can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available... We can get someone out there... looks like tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or... (pause) ...we could potentially squeeze you in the day after tomorrow in the afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better for me. Can we do that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you down for tomorrow, 8 AM to noon. The technician will come to your front door. Is there anything else we should know about accessing your place?

Customer: No, I should be home. It's fine.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation text message and email shortly with all the details. Is the phone number and email on file still good?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think so. What's the email showing?

Agent: [inaudible] ... at Frontier.com.

Customer: Okay, that's fine.

Agent: Alright, Michael, I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved right now, but our technician tomorrow should be able to track down what's going on. In the meantime, if anything changes with those lights or if your service comes back, just give us a call back.

Customer: Okay, will do. Thanks for your help, I guess.

Agent: Of course. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we'll get you sorted out tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
