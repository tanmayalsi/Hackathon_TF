Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up and running. I work from home and I've got meetings coming up.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me get some information from you real quick so I can pull up your account. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And just to confirm, this is at 4823 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Can you tell me what you've noticed? Like, are the lights on your modem or router flashing, are they off...?

Customer: Um, so the modem is, like, completely dark. There's no lights coming on at all. I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in like an hour ago, but nothing happened. It's been sitting there dark ever since.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let's try a couple things here. First, I want to make sure all your cables are connected properly. Can you check the power cable going into your modem? Just make sure it's firmly connected on both ends.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, hold on... (sounds of movement) Okay, I'm looking at it now. Yeah, the power cable looks pretty snug to me. It's definitely plugged into the wall and the modem.

Agent: Great. And do you see any visible damage to that cable at all? Like any fraying or burns?

Customer: No, it looks fine to me. Pretty normal.

Agent: Okay, good. Now, let me have you try a hard reset. Go ahead and unplug the power cable, and then just leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds. Count it out if you want.

Customer: Alright, unplugging now... (pause) Okay, I'm counting. One... two... three... (pause, background noise) Thirty seconds. Plugging back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's just give it a minute to boot back up. While we're waiting, can you tell me... have you had any recent storms in your area or any weather events?

Customer: Oh, um... actually, yeah. We had a pretty rough storm roll through last night. Power flickered a few times. I figured maybe that knocked something out, but I wasn't sure.

Agent: That could definitely be it. Sometimes power surges from storms can damage equipment. Okay, so it's been about a minute now. What are you seeing on the modem?

Customer: (pause) Still nothing, man. Still completely dark. Not a single light.

Agent: Hmm, okay. And the modem is definitely plugged into a working outlet? Like, if you plug something else into that same outlet, does it work?

Customer: Oh, good point. (pause, sound of movement) Let me... yeah, I plugged in a lamp and it turns on just fine.

Agent: Okay, so the outlet's good. Alright, let me check a couple things on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm showing service to your address looks active, so that's positive. But if the modem isn't powering on, that's usually a hardware issue. Let me ask you this... how long have you had your modem with us?

Customer: Oh man, I think... it's gotta be like four or five years at least. Maybe longer?

Agent: Okay, so it's been a while. And this is actually the first time it's completely died like this?

Customer: Yeah, first time. It's been working fine up until this morning.

Agent: Got it. Well, here's what I'm thinking. Given the storm last night and the fact that the modem won't power on at all, I'm fairly certain the unit itself took damage from a power surge. (pause) I do want to try one more thing before we write it off completely. Do you have access to a different power outlet? Like, maybe in another room or something? Could you try plugging the modem in there, just to rule out any issues with the outlet or the circuit?

Customer: Yeah, absolutely. Hold on. (sound of movement, [inaudible] background noise) Okay, I'm taking it to the kitchen... plugging it in here...

Agent: (pause) Anything?

Customer: Nope. Still nothing. Completely dead.

Agent: Alright, yeah, that confirms it's the modem itself. I'm really sorry about this, but unfortunately that means we're going to need to get you a replacement unit. The good news is that I can absolutely arrange that for you today.

Customer: Oh man, okay. How long is that going to take? Like I said, I really need internet back up for work.

Agent: I hear you. So normally we'd ship out a replacement, and that takes about three to five business days. However, depending on your location, we may have a local fulfillment center that can expedite it. Let me see... (typing sounds) Okay, so for your address, the fastest we can get one out would be two to three business days if we do expedited shipping.

Customer: Two to three days... that's still pretty long. Is there any way to do faster than that?

Agent: Unfortunately, that's the fastest we have available for replacements through our standard process. I wish I had a quicker option for you. The only thing I could suggest is checking if there's a Frontier retail location near you where you could potentially pick one up today, but I don't have that information readily available. You'd have to check our website for that.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Yeah, I'll look into that. But if I can't find one, go ahead and just set up the expedited replacement.

Agent: Absolutely, I can do that. Let me just get a few more details. Is the address we have on file still good for shipping? 4823 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And just so you're aware, there won't be any charge for the replacement modem since it's a hardware failure. We'll email you a shipping label, and then you can send the damaged one back to us once you receive the new one. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, okay. That's fair.

Agent: Great. So I'm going to get this expedited order placed for you right now. (typing, brief pause) Okay, I've got everything set up. You should receive a confirmation email within the next couple hours with tracking information. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I really hope this gets here soon because I'm losing money sitting here without internet.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you're in this situation. Again, with expedited shipping, you should have it within two to three business days. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's all.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for calling Frontier, and I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online today. We really appreciate your business, and we'll get you taken care of as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks for your help, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
