Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went down about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of. It's just... nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... alright, I've got your account. So your service went down about an hour ago, you said?

Customer: Yeah, around 2 o'clock. I was just working from home and suddenly everything just stopped. My computer lost connection.

Agent: Okay, I understand. That's frustrating. So let me start with some basic troubleshooting. Do you have your modem and router nearby?

Customer: Yeah, they're right here on the shelf next to me.

Agent: Perfect. Can you tell me... do you see any lights on the front of the modem right now? Any lights lit up at all?

Customer: (pause) Um, let me look... no, actually. Nothing. It's completely dark.

Agent: Okay, so the modem's not powered on. Let's check the power cable. Can you make sure it's plugged in securely to both the modem and the wall outlet?

Customer: (sounds of objects moving) Yeah, it's... it's plugged in. I can see it's definitely in the outlet. Should I try unplugging it and plugging it back in?

Agent: Yes, actually that's a good idea. Go ahead and unplug the power cable from the modem, and let's wait about 30 seconds. This will do a full restart.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now... (pause) ...counting down... thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in... okay, so now I'm waiting for the lights to come back on?

Agent: Yes, exactly. The modem should boot up. This typically takes about two to three minutes. Go ahead and give it a minute or so and let me know when you start seeing lights come on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing... one light just came on. It's like a green light, I think. Now another one...

Agent: Good, good. That's normal. Let those stabilize for another minute or two. While we're waiting, let me ask—when the internet went out, did you hear any unusual sounds or notice anything else odd? Like a power surge or anything?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just... instant. Like someone just flipped a switch.

Agent: Okay. And is your modem connected directly to your router, or do you have them in separate locations?

Customer: They're both here, they're connected together with an ethernet cable.

Agent: Alright, good. (pause) How are those lights looking now?

Customer: Um... okay, so I've got... maybe five or six lights on the modem now. But none of them are blinking? They're all just solid.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Can you tell me which lights are on? Is there one that says "Internet" or has a globe symbol?

Customer: (pause) Let me see here... I see like, Power, I think. And then there's... oh, there's one with a little earth symbol, I guess?

Agent: That would be the Internet light. Is that one on?

Customer: It's on, but it's not blinking like you'd normally see it. It's just... steady.

Agent: (pause) Okay, and what about your router? Do you see any lights on the router as well?

Customer: Yeah, the router has lights. Those look normal to me. They're blinking and everything.

Agent: Okay, so the router seems to be communicating. Let's try connecting to the WiFi network on your device. Do you have your phone or laptop with you?

Customer: I've got my laptop right here. Let me try... (typing sounds) ...okay, I'm looking for the WiFi networks. I don't see ours. I don't see our Frontier network at all.

Agent: You're not seeing it in the available networks list?

Customer: No, nothing. Should I try the modem restart again?

Agent: Well, let's try something different first. I'm going to ask you to do a hard reset on the modem. This is different from a simple restart. There's usually a small reset button on the back of the modem. It might be recessed. Do you see one?

Customer: (sounds of the customer moving the modem) The back of this thing... yeah, I can see a little button, like, inside a hole?

Agent: That's it. You'll need something small and pointy like a paperclip or a pen to press it. Go ahead and hold that for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... this is erasing everything, right? I mean, I'm going to have to reconfigure everything?

Agent: It will reset the modem to factory settings, so yes. But let's see if we can get the connection back first. You can always reconfigure if needed.

Customer: Alright... (pause) ...okay, releasing now. Lights are going out completely.

Agent: Perfect. Let's wait about three to four minutes for this to fully boot up and initialize. While we're waiting, let me take a look at your account here. (typing sounds) I'm checking for any service alerts in your area... (pause) ...I'm not seeing any active outages reported at this time.

Customer: So it might be something specific to me then?

Agent: It could be. Let's see what happens with this reset. Sometimes the modem's firmware gets corrupted or... (pause) ...how are we looking on those lights now?

Customer: Okay, lights are coming back up. I see... Power is on, and now I'm seeing that earth symbol again.

Agent: Same as before? Just solid, not blinking?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, solid. It's not... I mean, shouldn't it be doing something else?

Agent: [inaudible] ...typically yes, you'd see some activity. This is unusual. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Can you tell me the exact model of your modem? It should be on a sticker on the top or bottom.

Customer: (sounds of the customer looking) It says... Frontier... and then there's a model number... FG-200?

Agent: (typing) FG-200. Okay, I'm checking our system here. (pause) (typing continues) Alright, I'm looking at the diagnostics for your modem, and it's showing it's connected to our network, but there's something odd. It looks like your account might not be properly provisioned for your current modem, or there's a line sync issue.

Customer: Is that... is that something you can fix from your end?

Agent: Let me try something. I'm going to send a refresh signal to your modem right now. This should only take a minute. (pause) Okay, sending that now. Go ahead and check those lights in a moment and let me know if anything changes.

Customer: (long pause) Um... nothing seems different. Still just the solid lights.

Agent: (pause) Okay. You know, I hate to do this, but I think we might need to escalate this to our technical team. Something's preventing the modem from fully syncing with our network, and it's not something I can resolve through basic troubleshooting.

Customer: Wait, so... what does that mean? How long is that going to take?

Agent: I can schedule a technician to come out and look at the line itself. There could be an issue with the fiber connection outside your home, or it might be a bad modem that needs replacing. The earliest I can get someone out would be... (typing sounds) ...tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: (frustrated) Tomorrow? Really? I need this working for work today. I've got meetings coming up.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize. Let me see if there's anything else we can try... (pause) Is there any way you can restart your modem one more time while I'm on the line with you? Sometimes it takes a few attempts.

Customer: (sigh) Sure. Unplugging again... (pause) ...plugging back in.

Agent: Okay, we'll give it a moment to boot up again.

Customer: (long pause) (background noise of devices powering up) Okay, lights are back. Same thing as before. Power's on, Internet light's on but not doing anything.

Agent: (pause) And you're still not seeing the WiFi network?

Customer: Correct. Nothing.

Agent: (long pause) I'm sorry, but I think at this point we're going to need the technician to come out. Without physical access to the line and the equipment, I don't have another way to diagnose what's happening. This could be a fiber line issue, a bad port on the modem, or something else that I can't see from here.

Customer: Can't you just... I don't know, send me a new modem?

Agent: I could, but that would also take a few days to arrive, and then you'd still have no service while waiting. The technician can usually resolve it same-day or at least identify exactly what the issue is. If it's the modem, they can swap it out on site.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Okay, fine. Tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM.

Agent: Alright, let me get that scheduled for you. I'm going to put in a service request for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM window. Is the address on file still current?

Customer: Yeah, 447 Maple Street, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, we have your phone number as 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Alright, you should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes. The technician will also call you about 30 minutes before arrival. In the meantime, if anything changes with your connection, please feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Will I have to pay for this service call?

Agent: Since we haven't been able to resolve this remotely and it appears to be a service issue on our end, there shouldn't be a charge for the technician visit.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I guess that's something. Thank you, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get this taken care of for you tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... that's all.

Agent: Alright, thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and I apologize we couldn't get this resolved today. Have a good one.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
