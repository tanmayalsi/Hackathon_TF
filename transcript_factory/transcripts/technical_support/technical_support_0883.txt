# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'll definitely help you get this sorted out. Can I grab your account number real quick? It should be on your bill or modem.

Customer: Yeah, sure. It's... hold on. (rustling sounds) Okay, it's 47-2891-556.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thanks. And just to confirm, I'm looking at an account for... David Martinez?

Customer: That's me, yeah.

Agent: Great, David. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Can you tell me a little bit more about what's happening? Like, do you see any lights on the modem at all?

Customer: Um... (pause) Let me look. The modem's over there... Okay, so I see a red light, I think? Yeah, there's definitely a red light.

Agent: Okay, a red light. That typically means there's a connection issue. And you're looking at a Frontier router, right? It should say Frontier on it.

Customer: Yeah, yeah, it says Frontier. It's the white box thing.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, so here's what I'd like to do. Can you do me a favor and unplug the modem for me? Just pull it right out of the power outlet.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Yep, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now we're gonna let that sit for about 30 seconds. This just helps it reset. While we wait, have you had any storms in your area recently? Or any recent power outages?

Customer: Um, actually, yeah. There was some rough weather last night. Pretty bad wind and rain. I didn't think about that. Could that be it?

Agent: It's definitely possible. Power surges and weather can sometimes affect the modem. Okay, it should be about 30 seconds now. Go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause, plug sound) Okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Now just give it about a minute to boot up. We should see the lights come back on. What are you seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... some lights are coming on. I see blue and green now, which is better than the red, right?

Agent: That's a good sign, yeah. The green light means power and the blue should be your internet connection. Is it staying solid, or is it blinking?

Customer: It's... blinking. Is that bad?

Agent: No, that's actually normal when it's connecting. Just give it another minute or so to fully sync up. Sometimes it takes a little time.

Customer: Okay. (pause, longer pause) Um... it's still blinking. How long should this take?

Agent: It shouldn't be more than about two to three minutes total. Give it just another moment... Okay, David, is it showing solid now?

Customer: No, it's... it's still blinking. It's been like five minutes now probably.

Agent: Okay, that's a bit longer than normal. Let me try a different approach. Can you tell me what model modem you have? It should be printed on the back or bottom of the device.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Model... um... FR-G3100? Something like that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up that model now. And just so I understand the situation—you have lights but they're not stabilizing?

Customer: Right. The blue one keeps blinking and won't... it won't stop blinking.

Agent: Alright, let me try one more thing before we explore other options. I'm gonna ask you to do what we call a factory reset. But first, I need to know—do you have your Wi-Fi network name and password written down anywhere? Because this will erase the modem's settings.

Customer: Oh... (pause) Um, I think I have it somewhere. Why does it have to erase everything?

Agent: It basically clears out any corrupted settings that might be preventing the connection. In your case, with that power surge from the storm, it's possible the modem's settings got a little scrambled. Don't worry, your username and password will get you back online.

Customer: Okay, let me... (pause) Yeah, I found it. I'm ready.

Agent: Perfect. So on the modem, you should see a small button, usually recessed. It's labeled "Reset." You might need a paperclip or something small to push it. Go ahead and hold that down for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. Holding it down... (pause) Okay, I held it for like 15 seconds. Now what?

Agent: Now the modem's gonna restart. All the lights should go off and then come back on. Let's give it about a minute.

Customer: (pause) Okay, lights are going out... (pause) Yep, they're coming back on now. So now I see the red light again.

Agent: That's okay, red after a reset is pretty normal. It's reconfiguring. Let's give it another minute or two to fully boot.

Customer: (pause, longer pause) Okay... it's still red though. It's been like... (pause) ...three minutes and it's still red.

Agent: Hmm, that's strange. Let me pull up some additional diagnostics on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) David, can you verify for me—the cable that's plugged into the modem, that's coming directly from the wall outlet, right?

Customer: Well, it's... I mean, it's coming from where the cable comes in. Yeah, that's what I'd call the wall.

Agent: Okay, good. And you don't see any visible damage to the cable itself? Like no cuts or anything?

Customer: (pause) I'm looking... No, the cable looks fine. It's just laying there normal.

Agent: Alright, let me check something else. So it's been down since this morning, you said around what time?

Customer: Yeah, like 8 AM or so. I came downstairs to work and it just wasn't there.

Agent: And nothing's working? Like, you're not getting any Wi-Fi signal on your phone or anything?

Customer: No, nothing. I tried my phone, my laptop, nothing. It's all offline.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm actually pulling up our system here and I'm not seeing a modem sync on this account. That actually tells me the modem isn't currently connecting to our network at all.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could mean a few things. Either the modem itself is damaged from the power surge, or there's an issue with the line coming into your house. Um... let me see if we have any service alerts in your area. (pause, typing sounds) [inaudible] ...no alerts currently. 

Customer: So what do we do?

Agent: Alright, so I can try one more thing. I'm gonna walk you through testing a different cable if you have one. Do you have a spare coaxial cable? It's the cable with the little hexagonal connectors on each end?

Customer: Um... I don't think I have a spare. We've only got the one.

Agent: Okay, that's alright. (pause) I hate to say it, but at this point, I think we might be dealing with either a modem failure or a line issue that needs to be physically investigated. I'd like to get a technician out to your place to take a look.

Customer: Really? How long would that take? I kind of need this working today if possible.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) So, we actually don't have any same-day availability, but I can get someone out tomorrow. We have a morning window between 8 AM and 12 PM, or an afternoon window from 12 to 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: (pause) The morning, I guess. But I really need this figured out. What if it's something we can do right now?

Agent: I totally understand, and I really wish I could tell you there's another step we could take. But when the modem won't sync to our network at all, and we've tried the standard troubleshooting, it really does need hands-on inspection. It could be something at the junction box outside your house, or it could be the modem itself, but either way, the technician will be able to figure it out and get you back online.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, fine. Tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. So just to confirm, I have you down for tomorrow, [inaudible]...sorry, that's June 14th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive so you know what time to expect them.

Customer: Okay, got it. And they'll be able to fix it?

Agent: They should be able to diagnose the issue and get you working again. If the modem needs replacing, they can do that on the spot. If it's a line issue, they'll get that sorted as well.

Customer: Alright. Thank you, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, David. And I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?

Customer: No, that's... that's it.

Agent: Okay, great. Just as a heads up, you'll receive a confirmation text and email about your service appointment. If you need to reschedule, just let us know as soon as possible. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll get you back online tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, thanks.

Agent: Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
