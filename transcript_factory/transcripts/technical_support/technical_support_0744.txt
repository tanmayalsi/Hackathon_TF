Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just completely stopped working about an hour ago, and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you out here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... um... (pause) 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the name on the account?

Customer: Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got you pulled up here. So you mentioned your internet went down about an hour ago. Have there been any recent storms in your area, or did anything unusual happen before it stopped working?

Customer: No, actually. It was just working fine this morning. I was doing some work from home, and then all of a sudden the router just went dark. Like, completely dark. No lights or anything.

Agent: Okay, so the router's not showing any lights at all. That's helpful information. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. First, I want you to look at your modem—that's the box that connects directly to the wall—and tell me what lights you see on that device.

Customer: (pause) Um, hold on. Let me go grab it. It's in the other room.

Agent: No problem, take your time.

Customer: (background noise, footsteps) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. There's... it looks like there's just one light on, and it's red. Everything else is off.

Agent: Alright, so you're seeing one red light. That typically indicates a connection issue. Here's what I want you to do—I want you to unplug the modem from the power outlet, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. That'll do what we call a power cycle, and sometimes that clears things right up.

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) Unplugging it now... (pause) Alright, waiting. (pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Good. While that's booting back up, let me ask—do you have a separate router, or is everything in one unit?

Customer: I have a separate router. The router's the white one over there, and yeah, it's not lighting up at all.

Agent: Got it. So the router should start getting power once the modem boots up. Give it about two to three minutes to fully restart. You should see the lights come back on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm... I'm watching it. The modem's still just showing that red light. And nothing's happening with the router. (pause) It's been like... I don't know, a minute and a half or so?

Agent: Let's give it another minute or so. These things can take a little time. While we wait, let me ask you—when was the last time you restarted your modem? Do you remember?

Customer: Not recently, honestly. Maybe... a few months ago? Why, is that something I should be doing regularly?

Agent: It can help, yeah. A lot of people don't realize that a restart every month or two can really improve performance. But anyway, let's focus on getting you back online first.

(pause)

Customer: Okay, um... (pause) It's been a few minutes now, and I'm still just seeing that one red light on the modem. The router still isn't turning on.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try something else here. I'm going to check our network on my end. Can you hold for just one second?

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) [inaudible - background conversation] Okay, Michael, I'm back. So I'm not seeing any major outages in your area, which is good news. But I do want to try one more thing. The red light on your modem usually means it's not getting a connection from our network. I want you to check the cable that goes from the wall into your modem. It's usually a coaxial cable—it's got a little screw connector. Can you make sure it's tight?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It seems pretty snug, but let me try tightening it a bit more. (pause) Okay, it's definitely tighter now. Should I restart it again?

Agent: Let's do that. Go ahead and unplug it again.

Customer: Yep, unplugging... (pause) Waiting... (pause) Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Alright. And while that's booting up again, let me ask—have you noticed any flickering or issues with your service over the past week or two? Anything out of the ordinary?

Customer: No, it's been rock solid, actually. Which is why this is so weird.

Agent: Right, makes sense. (pause) Okay, Michael, what are we seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Still that red light. I don't understand. Everything was working this morning.

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. Let me... let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm pulling up your equipment details. Just to verify—you said you have the white Frontier router, correct?

Customer: Yeah, the white one. It's... it's one of those newer models, I think.

Agent: Okay. And when you look at the modem right now, besides the red light, are there any other lights that might be blinking, even faintly?

Customer: (pause) Let me look closer... No, nothing. Just that one red light.

Agent: Alright. Unfortunately, what you're describing—and especially that red light staying on after a restart—that typically indicates either a service outage on our end that I'm not seeing, or it could be an issue with the modem itself. (pause) I want to try one more thing before we explore other options. Can you check to make sure that the cable connection hasn't come loose where it enters your house? It might be outside or in a basement or something?

Customer: Um... I don't know. I'm not really sure where that would be. My house is pretty standard setup.

Agent: Okay, so you might have an external box—could be in your garage, or maybe where the cable enters the side of your house. Does that ring a bell?

Customer: Oh! Yeah, yeah, I think there is something in the garage. Let me go look. (background noise, footsteps) Okay, I'm out here. I see a gray box on the wall. Is that it?

Agent: That could be it, yes. Can you see if there's a cable connected to it?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's a thick cable coming out of it going up to... it looks like it goes into the house. And it's pretty firmly attached, I think.

Agent: Alright, that looks normal then. (pause, typing sounds) Michael, I've done what I can on my end with troubleshooting, and I'm honestly not seeing the issue from our network side. What I'm suspecting is that there might be an equipment failure with your modem, or potentially a service issue that I'm not detecting. I think the best course of action here is to get a technician out to your place to do a full diagnostic.

Customer: Oh man, really? How long would that take? I need my internet back—I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) What days work best for you this week?

Customer: I mean... ideally today? Or tomorrow morning?

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Let me see what we have... Unfortunately, today's pretty booked, but I can get someone out to you tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, I guess that'll have to work. Better than nothing.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I've got you down for tomorrow between 8 and noon. A technician will come out and they'll be able to replace the modem if that's the issue, or run a full line test to see if there's something on our end.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything else I should be checking or doing in the meantime?

Agent: You can try one more full restart if you'd like—make sure everything's disconnected for about a minute—but honestly, I think you're good to just wait for the technician at this point. They'll take care of it.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate it. What's my confirmation number or anything?

Agent: (typing sounds) Your service appointment is scheduled for tomorrow, and the confirmation number is 7842-FR. I'm going to email that to you along with the technician's contact information so they can call you if they need directions.

Customer: Great, thank you. I appreciate your help, even though we couldn't fix it today.

Agent: Of course. I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved over the phone, but our technician tomorrow should have you back up and running in no time. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, Michael. Thank you for being so patient with me today, and thank you for being a Frontier customer. We'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
