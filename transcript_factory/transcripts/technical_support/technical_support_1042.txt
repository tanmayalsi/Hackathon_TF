Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got work calls scheduled and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you troubleshoot this. First, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And your name?

Customer: It's Mike. Mike Henderson.

Agent: Perfect, Mike. I've got your account pulled up here. So your service went down this morning, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 AM. I tried restarting my modem and router, but nothing's worked. I've been without internet for like three hours now.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Are there any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, so the modem has some lights. There's a green light on the front, but there's a red light blinking next to it. The router has lights too but they're not doing anything really. They're just... off, I think.

Agent: Okay, so the red blinking light on the modem is actually what we want to look at. That typically indicates either a connection issue or a signal problem. Have you tried unplugging the modem and leaving it off for about 30 seconds?

Customer: Yeah, I did that. That's one of the things I tried already.

Agent: Alright, good thinking. When you plugged it back in, did the red light go away or is it still blinking?

Customer: It's still blinking. Still red.

Agent: Okay, let me check our systems here to see if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) What's your service address, Mike?

Customer: It's 442 Maple Drive, apartment 3B, in Portland.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any major outages reported in your area at the moment. That's good news. Do you have the model number of your modem handy? It should be on a sticker on the back.

Customer: Um, give me a second... (pause) Yeah, it says... looks like it's a... Arris something. An Arris NVG599.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, and that modem is powered on right now?

Customer: Yes, it's plugged in. Like I said, that green light is on.

Agent: Right, right. Okay, so here's what we're going to try. Can you unplug the power cable from the modem, just the power cable?

Customer: Okay, done.

Agent: Now I'm going to have you wait about 30 seconds. Just, um, count it out or grab a quick drink of water or something. Just give it a moment.

Customer: (pause) Alright, 30 seconds. Plugging it back in... now.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait for it to fully boot up. You should see the lights cycle through. What are you seeing?

Customer: Okay, so the green light came back on pretty quickly. But the red light... (pause) ...it's blinking again. It's doing the same thing.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Is the red light blinking fast or slowly?

Customer: It's... I'd say it's blinking pretty steadily. Not super fast, but it's definitely blinking.

Agent: Alright. Let me check something on your account. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm showing that you should have a signal coming to your location. Let me ask you this — have you looked at the cable connections on the back of the modem? Sometimes they can get loose, especially if someone bumps it or if there's been a storm.

Customer: Oh, good point. Let me check. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at the back here. There's a couple of cables plugged in. They look pretty tight to me, but... let me... (sounds of movement) Yeah, one of them looks a little loose. Let me try pushing it in more firmly.

Agent: Good, go ahead and do that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I pushed it in as far as it would go.

Agent: Excellent. Now let's unplug the modem one more time and do a full restart. Go ahead and pull the power.

Customer: Done.

Agent: And let's wait another 30 seconds or so.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in... now.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, what are the lights doing now?

Customer: (pause) Um... okay, so same thing. Green light is on, and the red light is blinking again. [inaudible] This is ridiculous.

Agent: I hear you, Mike. Let me try one more thing here. Are you near the modem right now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm standing right in front of it.

Agent: Okay, on the front of the modem, there should be a small button that's recessed a little bit. It might say "Reset" next to it. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) I... I think so? There's a small indent. Is that what you're talking about?

Agent: That's the one. Now, I'm going to have you hold that button down for about 10 to 15 seconds. This is going to reset the modem to factory settings, so heads up on that.

Customer: Okay... holding it down... (pause) ...fifteen seconds... okay, letting go.

Agent: Great. Now we're going to let it reboot. This might take a minute or two, so just bear with me here. While that's happening, I'm going to check your line status on the backend.

Customer: (pause) Okay. How long should this take?

Agent: It shouldn't be more than a couple minutes. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm. Mike, I'm actually noticing something in your account here. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check with my supervisor about something. It'll just be a moment.

Customer: Okay... sure.

(hold music plays) (about 45 seconds)

Agent: Thanks for holding, Mike. I'm back. Okay, so I checked a few things, and I'm actually seeing some potential line signal issues on our end. The signal levels coming to your location seem to be fluctuating. That's what's likely causing that red light.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: So, typically this could be caused by a few things — sometimes it's a line issue outside, a tap problem, or something with the splitters inside your apartment. Unfortunately, from here, I'm not able to run a full diagnostic on the line itself. What I'm going to need to do is schedule a technician to come out and take a look at this in person.

Customer: A technician? When can they come out? I really need this working today if possible.

Agent: Let me check our availability for today. (typing sounds) (pause) It looks like we have some availability later this afternoon. We have a window between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that could work. That would be... that would be better than nothing anyway.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. The technician should arrive sometime in that window. Can you confirm that 442 Maple Drive, apartment 3B is the correct address for the visit?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And before I let you go, Mike — is the modem showing any different lights now? Any chance it's come back up?

Customer: No, still the same. Red light blinking, green light on. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Alright, well, the technician will definitely get to the bottom of this when they arrive. I'm going to email you a confirmation with the appointment details and our technician's phone number in case you need to reschedule or if they need to contact you. You should receive that within the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate it. So they'll be here between 1 and 5?

Agent: That's correct. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Hopefully they can fix whatever's going on.

Agent: I'm confident they will. I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online right now, but our technician is really going to help us figure out what's happening. Thank you for your patience, Mike, and we appreciate your business with Frontier.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
