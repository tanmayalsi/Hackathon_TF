# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't figure out what's wrong with it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: Perfect, David. I see your account here. So your service went out about an hour ago—did anything happen before that? Like, did you restart anything or was there a storm in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I was just, you know, working from home and watching my email, and everything was fine, and then just... nothing. No internet.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Let me ask you a few quick questions. When you look at your modem and router right now, what lights are you seeing?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...there's a red light on the modem. It's solid red.

Agent: Okay, solid red. That typically means there's no signal coming in. Before we do anything else, let's try a hard reset. Can you unplug the modem from the power for about thirty seconds?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause, background noise of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds while we chat. How long have you been a customer with us, David?

Customer: Oh, probably about two years now? Maybe a little longer. Pretty happy with the service usually, so...

Agent: That's great to hear. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug that modem back in for me.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Give it about sixty seconds to fully boot up and restart. While we're waiting, I'm going to check if there are any outages in your area. Can you give me your zip code?

Customer: It's 94301.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, checking that now. (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages in that area right now, so that's good news. Are you seeing any lights on the modem yet?

Customer: Um, yeah. Now I see some blue lights. There's like... a couple of them blinking.

Agent: Okay, blue lights are good. That means it's connecting. Give it another thirty seconds or so and you should see the internet light turn solid blue or green, depending on your model.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. (pause) Hmm. Still blinking. (longer pause) Nope, it's still just... blinking.

Agent: Still blinking? Okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm going to run a line test here. (pause) David, have you noticed any issues with the service before today? Like slower speeds or frequent dropouts?

Customer: Not really, no. It's been pretty solid. This is the first time anything like this has happened.

Agent: Alright. So the test I ran shows that the line is connecting, but it seems like there might be a signal issue. Let me ask you this—do you have the modem plugged directly into the wall outlet, or is it on a power strip?

Customer: It's on a power strip, actually. With like, a few other things.

Agent: Can you try unplugging it from the power strip and plugging it directly into the wall outlet? Sometimes power strips can cause issues.

Customer: Oh, okay. Yeah, I can do that. (pause, background noise) Alright, I'm unplugging it from the strip... and now I'm plugging it into the wall. (pause) Let it boot up again?

Agent: Yes, please. Give it about a minute to restart and fully come online.

Customer: (pause, long pause) Okay... still the same thing. I've got the blue lights blinking, but nothing's working. I can't connect to any websites.

Agent: Okay. Let me try something else. Can you check the cables for me? The coaxial cable coming from the wall—the one that goes into the modem—is it secure? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean... it looks pretty tight to me. But let me try unscrewing it a little and then screwing it back in, just to make sure. (pause, background noise) Okay, yeah, it's tight. (pause) Still blinking.

Agent: Alright. And what about the ethernet cable? Do you have one plugged in, or are you using Wi-Fi?

Customer: Oh, I was using Wi-Fi, but let me try plugging in an ethernet cable to see if that makes a difference. (pause, rustling sounds) Okay, I found one. (pause) Plugging it in now. (pause) Nope. Still nothing.

Agent: Nothing on the ethernet either. Okay, David, I want to be honest with you. The signal seems to be getting to your modem, but something's preventing it from fully coming online. This might be an issue with the modem itself, or there could be a problem with the line coming into your home.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Like, what do we do?

Agent: Well, I have a couple options for you. We can try a factory reset on the modem, which will wipe all the settings, but that's pretty technical and might not solve it anyway. Or, I can dispatch a technician to your address to check the line and your equipment. The technician can usually get out within 24 to 48 hours, depending on our availability.

Customer: How much is that going to cost me?

Agent: (pause) Let me check your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so since you've been a good customer and this is your first issue, if it turns out to be on our end—meaning the line or our equipment—there's no service charge. If it ends up being something on your end, it would be $99 for the service call.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I guess that's fair. But do you want to try the factory reset first, just to be sure?

Agent: We can absolutely try that if you'd like. Are you comfortable doing a factory reset, or would you rather just schedule the technician?

Customer: I mean, we can try it. Might as well, right?

Agent: Sure, that makes sense. Okay, so on your modem, you're going to look for a small button, usually recessed, labeled "Reset." It's typically on the back. Have you got your modem handy?

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (pause, shuffling sounds) Okay, I'm looking at it. I see... I see a button that says "Reset." (pause) It's pretty tiny.

Agent: Yeah, that's the one. You're going to need to press and hold that button for about ten seconds. You can use a paperclip or something small to press it. When you do, all the lights are going to go out, and then it'll restart completely.

Customer: (pause, background noise, beep sounds) Okay, I'm holding it. (pause) And... the lights just went out. (pause) Okay, I'm letting go. Now it's restarting.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) This should take about two to three minutes. While it's restarting, let me pull up your information again and I'll have you schedule the technician as a backup.

Customer: (pause) Okay. (pause) Alright, the lights are coming back now. (pause) I see the blue lights again, but... (pause, longer pause) ...they're still blinking.

Agent: Still blinking?

Customer: Yeah. Same as before. (pause) I don't think this is working.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I'm not seeing any change on my end either. I think at this point, we're looking at either a modem hardware issue or something with the line itself. I think we need to get a technician out there to take a look.

Customer: Alright. Yeah, let's do that then. I need my internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. (typing sounds) So what's your preferred appointment window? We have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM, or the day after tomorrow morning.

Customer: Tomorrow works. The morning would be better if you have it.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, December 14th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. A technician will be arriving at your address at 2847 Maple Drive, and you should receive a confirmation text and email shortly.

Customer: Okay, great. Is there anything I should do in the meantime?

Agent: You can leave the modem as it is—plugged in and powered on. That way the technician can see the exact state it's in. If you want to try restarting it one more time tonight, that's fine, but I wouldn't do anything else.

Customer: Okay, will do. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, David. I'm sorry we weren't able to get it working over the phone, but I'm confident our technician will get you sorted out tomorrow. If you need anything else before the appointment, feel free to call back. Thanks for choosing Frontier Communications.

Customer: Thanks. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Take care.
