# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet has been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I need to get this fixed pretty quick.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan at that address. And you're saying the internet is completely down?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. Like, nothing. The router's on, the lights are on, but there's no internet coming through. I tried unplugging everything already.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on trying that. Let me ask you a few questions. When you look at your modem—that's the box that usually comes directly from the wall—what color are the lights on it?

Customer: Um, let me walk over to it. (pause) Okay, so I see a red light and then there's like... a couple of blue lights that are blinking?

Agent: Okay, so a solid red light typically means there's no signal coming from our network to your modem. That's usually the issue we're dealing with. Did anything change before the internet went down? Like a power outage or anything?

Customer: No, I mean... well, actually there was some construction happening outside this morning. I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but they were working on the street.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that actually could be related. They might have disrupted the line. Let me check our network on this end. (typing sounds) Hold on just one second while I look at your connection status.

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (pause) Alright, so on my end, your modem is showing as offline. It's not even registering on our network right now. This could be a few things. Have you checked to make sure all the cables are plugged in securely? Sometimes they can get loosened.

Customer: Yeah, I checked that. Everything looks tight. The cables are all in pretty good.

Agent: Alright, let's try a full restart then. I want you to unplug the modem from the power outlet, then unplug the router as well.

Customer: Okay, (pause) done.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about thirty seconds. (pause) While we wait, I should mention that with that construction going on outside, it's possible the fiber line got damaged or disconnected. But let's see if a restart helps first.

Customer: Uh-huh.

Agent: Okay, thirty seconds should be up. Now go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in now.

Agent: Give it about a minute to boot up. You should see the lights change from red to green or solid blue, which means it's getting signal again.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... I'm looking at it. So the lights are... they're still red and blue, same as before. It's not changing.

Agent: The red light is still there? It's not turning green at all?

Customer: Nope. Still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay, and you plugged the modem in directly to the wall outlet, not through a power strip?

Customer: No, it's plugged into the wall. Directly into the wall.

Agent: Alright, let me try something else here. Can you tell me where your modem is located? Like, is it on the wall where your fiber line comes in?

Customer: It's... yeah, it's mounted on the wall in my bedroom. The fiber line comes through there.

Agent: Perfect. I want you to take a look at the fiber cable itself—that's the thin, usually clear plastic cable that goes into the modem. Can you make sure it's plugged in all the way?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks plugged in. But let me... let me just try wiggling it to make sure. (pause) Okay, I'm wiggling it. (pause) Nothing's happening.

Agent: Alright. You know what, it really does sound like there might be a physical issue with the line due to that construction work. When you looked outside, did you notice anything unusual? Like cables on the ground or anything?

Customer: I didn't get a good look, honestly. I just saw them working on the street with some equipment.

Agent: Yeah, okay. What I'd like to do is escalate this to our field service team because this is likely going to need an in-person inspection. They'll need to come out and check if the line was damaged.

Customer: How long is that going to take? I really need internet today if possible.

Agent: I totally understand. Let me check what our availability looks like. (typing sounds) (pause) So we have availability tomorrow between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m., or we could potentially get someone out today if it's an emergency, but that would be... (pause) let me see... that would probably be around 4 p.m. at the earliest.

Customer: Can they come out today at 4?

Agent: Let me submit a priority ticket and see if we can make that happen. (typing sounds) What's the best number to reach you on to confirm?

Customer: 555-0147, same number.

Agent: Perfect. And you'll be home this afternoon around 4?

Customer: Yeah, I can make that work.

Agent: Excellent. Let me just try one more thing before we wrap up, and then I'll get this ticket submitted. Can you check if there's a battery backup unit near your modem? It's usually a separate box. If there is, can you unplug that as well and give it thirty seconds?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't see anything like that. Just the modem.

Agent: Alright, no problem. I'll submit this ticket now as priority, and someone from our field team will reach out to confirm whether they can make it today at 4. In the meantime, unfortunately, your internet is going to stay down, but worst case, we can definitely get you in tomorrow morning.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. So I should just expect a call?

Agent: Yes, you'll get a call from our field service team to confirm they're coming out today. And if they can't make it today, they'll schedule you for the first available slot tomorrow morning. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying.

Agent: You're very welcome, and again, I'm sorry you're dealing with this. We'll get you back online as soon as possible. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and have a great day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
