Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, uh, my internet just went out completely and I can't get it back online. I've been without service for like the past hour.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. We'll definitely get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got your account here. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you noticed any other issues with your service, like your phone or TV?

Customer: No, just the internet. The lights on my modem are... uh... let me look. Okay, so the power light is on, but I don't see the internet light. It's like completely dark.

Agent: Alright, that's actually really helpful information. That tells me we might be looking at either a modem issue or a connection problem on our end. Let me just take a quick look at your line here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so from our side, I'm showing that your modem hasn't connected to our network in about fifty-two minutes, which matches up with what you're experiencing.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it something I can fix?

Agent: Good question. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, I'm doing that now.

Agent: Great. And while we're waiting, how long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, about three years now. Usually, the service is pretty solid, but this is frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand. Alright, go ahead and leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. That's going to clear the system memory and hopefully reset the connection.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...it's been about thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugged it back in. (pause) Hmm, the lights are... the power light is back on, and now I see... is that the internet light? Yeah, there's a light on now.

Agent: Good! That's progress. So it should start reconnecting to our network. It might take a minute or two. Are you seeing it establish a connection?

Customer: (pause) Um... I'm not sure, actually. Let me check on my computer. (pause) No, still nothing. The computer still says no internet connection. And uh, the light on the modem is blinking, but it's... it's not staying solid.

Agent: Okay, so it's blinking. That usually means it's still trying to connect. Let's give it another minute or so. Sometimes these things take a little bit.

Customer: Alright. (pause) Still blinking. (pause) Nope, nothing.

Agent: Okay, Michael. Let me try something else. Can you check the back of your modem for me? There should be a cable going from the wall into the modem. Can you just verify that cable is plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it. It looks... I mean, it looks plugged in, but let me try wiggling it... (pause) Okay, I'm pushing it in a bit more firmly. Oh, actually... the light just went off again.

Agent: Okay, when you jiggled it?

Customer: Yeah, when I pushed it in. Should I... what should I do?

Agent: Let's leave it as is and see if it reconnects. Sometimes those connectors need a little bit of a push to seat properly. This might be it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, still... still blinking. (pause) Nope, still nothing on my computer.

Agent: Alright, let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) (pause) Michael, I'm not seeing your modem making a connection attempt to our network right now. That's a bit concerning. It might be that the issue is actually with your modem itself or potentially with the outside line connection to your home.

Customer: So, is it... is it something that's broken? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: It's possible, but let's not jump to that yet. You know what, let me try one more thing. I'm going to reset some things on our end and that should send a signal to your modem. It might take a couple minutes.

Customer: Okay, how long should I wait?

Agent: Give it about three to five minutes, and then try restarting your modem one more time. Just pull the power again and wait thirty seconds like we did before.

Customer: Alright, I can do that. (pause) How long should I wait before I call back or check it again?

Agent: Why don't you give it the five minutes, restart the modem, and then if it doesn't come back up after about another five minutes of letting it boot up completely, go ahead and give us a call back. This time you can reference this ticket. Let me give you a ticket number. It's... (typing sounds) ...FRN-4827591.

Customer: FRN-4827591. Got it.

Agent: Perfect. Now, if it still isn't working, what we might need to do is either replace your modem or have a technician come out to check the line coming into your house. But let's see if this reset helps first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, um, actually I just want to check one more time right now. I don't see any change. The modem light is still blinking.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me... let me try that reset I mentioned now instead of waiting. (typing sounds) (longer pause) Alright, I've initiated it from our end. This time give it a good ten minutes and don't touch anything. Sometimes these resets take a little longer.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm... I'm going to wait. (pause) This is really frustrating. I work from home, and I really need this connection.

Agent: I hear you, and I really apologize. I know how critical that is. So after you've waited the ten minutes and restarted the modem, if you still don't see that internet light staying solid and your connection coming back, we should probably schedule a technician visit. They can come out and check the line quality and everything to make sure there's nothing wrong on our end or with the equipment at your location.

Customer: (pause) Okay, um... I'm actually looking at it now and... no, still blinking. It's been a few minutes. Can we just schedule the technician? I need to get this working today if possible.

Agent: I absolutely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) What does the rest of your day look like? Are you available for a same-day visit?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually I should be home. What time are we talking?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, Michael, our next available slot for a technician visit in your area is actually tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. I know that's not ideal, but that's the earliest we have.

Customer: (sigh) Tomorrow? There's nothing today?

Agent: I'm really sorry, I'm not seeing any same-day availability. But I can get you scheduled for tomorrow morning, and hopefully they'll be able to get everything sorted out quickly. They might just need to replace the modem or check that outside connection.

Customer: Yeah, okay, I guess I'll... I'll take tomorrow. What do I need to do?

Agent: Alright, so I'm going to schedule that for you right now. Do you have your service address there with you to confirm?

Customer: It's 1247 Maple Street, Apartment 3B, Springville.

Agent: Perfect, I've got that in the system. Michael, you're all set for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM window. You should get a confirmation email in the next few minutes, and there will be a phone number on there if you need to reschedule or if you have any questions.

Customer: Okay, great. Is there anything I should try before then?

Agent: You know, you can keep trying the restart we did earlier whenever you think of it, but honestly, if the modem isn't connecting after our reset, it's probably something physical that needs to be looked at. Just make sure someone's home to let the technician in.

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: My pleasure, Michael. I'm sorry we couldn't get it fixed over the phone today, but we'll get you back up and running tomorrow. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Take care.
