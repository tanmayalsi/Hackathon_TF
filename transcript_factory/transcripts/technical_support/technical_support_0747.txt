# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet just stopped working about an hour ago. I've got no connection at all and I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. First, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can you spell your last name for me?

Customer: It's Johnson. J-O-H-N-S-O-N.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, Mr. Johnson. I've got your account pulled up here. I'm seeing you're on our Fiber 100 plan. So you're getting absolutely no internet at all right now?

Customer: Nothing. My Wi-Fi symbol just disappeared from my phone, and I tried my laptop too, same thing. It was working fine this morning.

Agent: Okay, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you locate your router and modem? They're usually small boxes, one might say "Frontier" on it.

Customer: Yeah, I see them. They're right here next to my TV.

Agent: Great. Now, what I need you to do is look at the lights on the front of your modem. Can you tell me what you see? Are there any lights on, or are they all dark?

Customer: Um... (pause) let me see here. There's a power light that's green, and there's... okay, there's one that says "Internet" and it's red. Or maybe orange? It's definitely not green.

Agent: Alright, so the Internet light is red or orange. That's actually a good indicator that we're looking at a connection issue. And what about the modem itself? Do you see any blinking lights at all?

Customer: Yeah, the Internet light is blinking. It keeps going on and off.

Agent: Perfect, thank you for that detail. A blinking light typically means it's trying to establish a connection but can't quite get there. Let's try a simple reboot first. I want you to unplug the power cable from the back of your modem—just pull it straight out.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) It's out.

Agent: Good. Now, let's give it about 30 seconds. I know it seems like a long time, but it helps clear out any errors. While we're waiting, have you experienced any outages in your area recently that you're aware of?

Customer: Not that I know of. My neighbor's internet seems to be working fine, I think. I mean, I saw him outside earlier and he didn't mention anything.

Agent: That's helpful information, actually. Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's back in. The power light came back on immediately.

Agent: Good. Now let's watch those lights. The modem should go through a startup sequence. It'll take about two to three minutes. Can you tell me when all the lights stabilize?

Customer: Okay, so it's blinking a lot right now. (pause) Um... (pause) still blinking. How long did you say?

Agent: Should be in the next minute or so. Just keep watching for me.

Customer: (pause) Alright, um... the Internet light is still blinking. It's been like a minute and a half at least.

Agent: Still blinking? Okay, that's unusual. Let's move on to the router. I need you to do the same thing with that—unplug it completely and leave it unplugged while we wait another 30 seconds.

Customer: Okay, the router's unplugged too. (pause) Now I've got nothing on at all.

Agent: Right, it should all be dark. While we're waiting, let me ask you—have there been any storms in your area recently? Sometimes that can affect the connection.

Customer: No, it's been clear all week actually. Just been normal weather.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in. (pause) Power's coming back on... the lights are lighting up again.

Agent: Okay, and let's give this another minute or two for everything to stabilize.

Customer: (pause) This is taking a while. (pause) Okay, the modem's Internet light is... it's still blinking. It's just blinking over and over. It's not staying solid.

Agent: Hmm. [inaudible] Alright, Mr. Johnson, let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds, pause) I'm pulling up your service details... (pause) I'm not showing any outages on our end, so this is definitely isolated to your connection. Let me see if I can pull up any error logs... (pause)

Customer: How long do you think this will take? I've got a work meeting in like 20 minutes and I really need this to work.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me try one more thing. Can you check the cables for me? I need you to make sure the cable coming from the wall is securely plugged into the back of your modem. Sometimes these connections can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm checking it. It... (pause) it seems pretty secure to me. It's tight.

Agent: Okay, and is the cable itself damaged at all? Sometimes if you've got a pinch or a bend in it, that can cause connection problems.

Customer: No, it looks fine to me. It's running behind the entertainment center though, so it's a little hard to see the whole thing.

Agent: Can you trace it back and see if there's anywhere it might be pinched or bent?

Customer: (pause) [inaudible]... no, I don't think so. I mean, it's dark back there, but I don't feel anything obviously wrong.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else here. I'm going to send a signal reset to your modem from my end. Give me just one second. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I've sent that through. Can you tell me if any of the lights change?

Customer: (pause) Um... (pause) No, they're still the same. Still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let me pull up your account history and... (typing sounds, pause) I'm looking at your service here, and everything appears active on our side. The connection should be coming through.

Customer: So what does that mean? Does that mean something's broken?

Agent: Well, it could mean a few things. It could be an issue with the equipment itself, or there could be a line issue we're not detecting from this end. Have you tried connecting directly to the modem with an ethernet cable? Just to rule out a Wi-Fi issue?

Customer: Um, I don't have an ethernet cable, I don't think. Let me look... (pause) No, I don't see one.

Agent: That would have been helpful to try, but no worries. Do you have any other devices you could test? Like a tablet or another phone?

Customer: I tried my phone already. And my laptop won't connect either. Same thing.

Agent: Okay, so it's affecting all devices. That confirms the issue is with your modem's internet connection, not the Wi-Fi. (pause) Mr. Johnson, I want to be honest with you here. Based on what we're seeing, I'm not able to resolve this remotely. The blinking Internet light and the fact that the modem isn't establishing a connection after a reboot typically indicates either a modem hardware failure or a line issue at the network level that I can't see from here.

Customer: So what do I do? I need my internet back.

Agent: I have a couple of options for you. The first is we can schedule a technician to come out to your location. They can test the line and determine whether it's a modem issue or a line issue. The second option is if you want, I can send you a replacement modem, but given that I can't confirm it's the modem, that might not solve the problem immediately.

Customer: How long would it take to get a technician out here?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds, pause) I'm looking at tomorrow's schedule and it looks like we have availability between 8 AM and 12 PM, or between 1 PM and 5 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: I mean... I really need this fixed today if possible. Is there any way someone could come out this evening?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Let me see what I can do. (pause) Unfortunately, our last available window today is already closed. Our technicians stop scheduling appointments at 3 PM for evening visits, and... (typing sounds) it's already 4:15. I wish I had better news on that front.

Customer: Okay, so tomorrow morning then. What time should I schedule for?

Agent: Let me get that set up for you right now. (typing sounds) I'm going to schedule you for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Is there a specific time within that window you'd prefer?

Customer: Uh, morning is fine. Earlier is better if you can do it.

Agent: Perfect. Let me put you down for 9 AM as the target time. The technician will arrive within that 8 to 12 window. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got that scheduled. You should receive a confirmation email momentarily, and you can also see the appointment details in your account portal.

Customer: Alright. So... is there anything I can do in the meantime? Anything else to try?

Agent: Unfortunately, at this point, I don't think there's much more we can troubleshoot without the technician seeing the line. Keep the modem and router powered on so we can continue to monitor for any changes. And if it mysteriously comes back online before tomorrow, that would be great news, but I wouldn't count on it based on what we're seeing.

Customer: Yeah, okay. This is really frustrating. I had this internet working perfectly fine this morning.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Johnson, and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get this resolved for you tomorrow morning. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll just... I'll see the technician tomorrow I guess.

Agent: Perfect. Your confirmation number for this service call is FR-8847329. I'd recommend saving that in case you need to reference it. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and again, I apologize for the trouble. We'll get you back online.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a good evening, Mr. Johnson. Goodbye.
