Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I'm working from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be, especially when you're trying to work. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm showing an account for Michael Torres at 4521 Maple Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So your internet service went out about an hour ago. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router? Are they powered on?

Customer: Um, yeah, let me check. I'm looking at it now. So the modem has a red light on it, and the router... the router light is off completely.

Agent: Okay, the red light on the modem typically indicates there's an issue with the connection. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, doing it now. It's unplugged.

Agent: Good. And while we wait, can you also unplug your router? That's the smaller box usually.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Both unplugged now.

Agent: Perfect. Let's wait about 30 seconds for them to fully power down. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) I see some lights now. There's a green light and an orange light...

Agent: Good, that's normal while it's booting up. Give it about 60 seconds to fully come back online. We want to see if that green light becomes solid.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been a minute. I'm still seeing the orange light, and now there's also a red light blinking next to it.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That red blinking light isn't ideal. Let me check our system to see if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any outages on our end, so let's check your connection. Can you go ahead and plug the router back in now?

Customer: Okay. (plugging sounds) It's plugged in.

Agent: Great. Now, do you have a computer or phone nearby that you can try to connect to the router?

Customer: Yeah, I have my laptop right here. Let me... (pause) Okay, I can see the WiFi networks. I see my Frontier network. Let me try connecting... (pause) It's asking for the password. (pause) [inaudible] okay, it says connected, but when I try to open a webpage, nothing's loading.

Agent: Alright, so you're connecting to the WiFi, but there's no actual internet connection. That confirms what the lights are telling us. Let me try something else. On the modem itself, do you see a button that says "Reset" or looks different from the other buttons?

Customer: Um... I see like a small indented button on the back. Is that it?

Agent: That might be it. But before we reset, let me try one more thing. Can you check if there are any cables plugged into the modem? Usually there's one from the wall outlet and one going to the router.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see the cable from the wall, and there's another one going to the router. Wait, the one from the wall... (pause) it looks like it might be a little loose. Let me push it in more.

Agent: Oh, good catch. Let's try that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I pushed it in. (pause) Oh! I see the lights changing! There's a green light now, and the red light is gone. Wait... (pause) let me try the website again. (pause) (pause) No, still nothing. The page isn't loading.

Agent: Still not loading, okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm going to run a line test to see what's happening with your connection. (pause) Can you stay on the line for about two minutes while I do this?

Customer: Yeah, sure, I can wait.

Agent: (pause) Okay, while that's running, have you experienced any outages recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. The internet has been working fine until today.

Agent: And you haven't made any changes to your equipment or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. It just stopped working.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm getting some concerning data here. It looks like we're not getting a proper signal on our end for your line. This could mean a few different things – it could be an issue with the line itself, or it could be something with the equipment.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, here's what I'd like to try. I'm going to send a reset command to your modem remotely. This is different from a manual reset. It should take about five minutes, and you might see the lights flash and change. Just don't unplug anything, okay?

Customer: Okay, I won't touch it.

Agent: (pause) Alright, sending that now. (typing sounds) (pause) It should be processing. How are those lights looking?

Customer: (pause) They're... they're flickering. Orange, green, red, orange again...

Agent: That's normal. It's rebooting. Give it a couple more minutes. (pause) (pause) How's it looking now?

Customer: (pause) Still blinking. (pause) Okay, now it looks like it's settling down. I'm seeing a solid green light and the red light is gone.

Agent: Great. Try connecting again with your laptop.

Customer: (pause) Okay, the WiFi is connecting... (pause) connected. Let me try opening a website. (pause) (pause) Nope. Still nothing. It's not loading. This is frustrating.

Agent: (pause) I understand. Unfortunately, what we're seeing here is a signal issue on our line to your location, and the remote reset didn't resolve it. At this point, it's likely something that needs to be checked physically by our technician.

Customer: So you're saying you can't fix this over the phone?

Agent: I'm afraid not. We've done what we can from my end, but there appears to be an issue with the line itself. I'd like to schedule a technician to come out and take a look. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, I guess I don't have much choice. When can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. For your area, we have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have another slot on Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning, I guess. I need to get back online as soon as possible.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule a technician for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. Someone will come to 4521 Maple Drive. I'll send you a confirmation email and text message with all the details. The tech will likely need access to your equipment and possibly to the outside of the house, so just keep that in mind.

Customer: Okay, so they'll be here sometime between 8 and noon tomorrow?

Agent: That's right. And Michael, I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved today over the phone. Hopefully the technician will have you back up and running quickly.

Customer: Yeah, alright. Thank you, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications. We'll see you tomorrow, and sorry again for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thanks. Goodbye.

Agent: Goodbye.
