Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um, my internet went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've tried restarting the router and everything, and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's area code 555, 234-7891.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. Just one moment... Alright, I've got you here. Your service address is on Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned the internet went out about an hour ago. Before that, were you experiencing any issues at all? Any slowness or disconnections?

Customer: No, it was working fine. I was just, you know, watching Netflix and then suddenly everything just stopped. The router's still on, the lights are blinking, but I can't connect to anything.

Agent: Okay, so the router's powered on and showing activity lights. That's good. Let me have you try a couple of things for me. First, can you unplug the router from the power cable for about thirty seconds? Just completely remove it.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, yeah, I'm doing that right now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now while we're waiting, let me also have you check the modem. Do you see the modem next to the router? It should be a separate box.

Customer: Oh, um, yeah, I see it. It's got a bunch of lights on it.

Agent: Right. Go ahead and unplug that one too. Let's give both of those devices a fresh restart.

Customer: (pause) Okay, both unplugged. How long do I wait?

Agent: Let's wait about thirty seconds. That'll clear out the memory and reset the connection. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (background noise, plugging sounds) Doing it now... okay, it's back in.

Agent: Good. Now while that's booting up, can you tell me—have you had any service issues in the past week or so? Any weather in your area recently? Sometimes storms can affect the line.

Customer: Um, no, nothing major. It rained yesterday but nothing too crazy. It's been pretty clear today.

Agent: Okay. Now go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Plugging it in... (pause) It's back on. The lights are coming back, same as before.

Agent: Alright, give it about a minute to fully boot up. While it's doing that, is there a cable line that connects from the modem to the wall? Can you check and make sure that's firmly connected?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking... it's plugged in. Seems pretty solid to me.

Agent: Okay, and what about the cable from the modem to the router? Is that connected?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that one's connected too. I haven't touched any of those cables, though. This is weird.

Agent: I understand. Have the lights on the modem come fully back on now?

Customer: (pause) Um, let's see... yeah, I think so. There's like, a green light and then an orange light that's blinking.

Agent: Okay, so the orange light blinking—that typically indicates that it's trying to synchronize with the network. That should go away in a minute or two. Can you try connecting to the WiFi now? Pull up a website and see if it loads.

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) I'm trying to connect to the network... okay, I see it. (pause) Yeah, I'm connected to the network but... (longer pause) ...it's not loading. The page is just spinning and spinning.

Agent: Alright, give it another moment. Sometimes it takes a bit longer after a restart. (pause) Anything?

Customer: Nope. Still nothing. This is taking forever.

Agent: I see. Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) Can you tell me what model of router you're using? There should be a sticker on top of it.

Customer: Um... (pause) It says Frontier... something something... (laughing nervously) It's hard to read. It says FBX-something.

Agent: That's okay. That's our equipment, which is good. Now, I'm going to check if there are any outages in your area. One moment. (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any known outages on Maple Street, so that's not it. Can you try restarting your computer or device? Sometimes the issue can be on the device side.

Customer: Yeah, I guess I could try that. (pause, restarting sounds) Okay, it's restarting. Should I wait until it boots all the way up?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and wait for that. I'll be right here.

Customer: (pause) Okay... okay, it's loading. (longer pause) Alright, it's back up. (pause) Still nothing. I'm still not able to connect to anything.

Agent: Okay. Let me try a different approach. Can you access the router's admin panel? Do you know how to do that?

Customer: Um... admin panel? I'm not really... I'm not that tech-savvy, to be honest.

Agent: No problem. That's alright. Let me walk you through it. Open up a web browser and try typing in 192.168.0.1—that's one-nine-two-dot-one-six-eight-dot-zero-dot-one.

Customer: (typing sounds) Okay, typing it in... (pause) Nothing's happening.

Agent: [inaudible]... try it again?

Customer: (typing sounds) Yeah, I'm trying again. Still nothing.

Agent: (pause) Alright, that's... that's unusual. Let me pull up some diagnostics on my end. Can you stay with me for just a moment? (typing sounds, pause) I'm running a line test here...

Customer: Yeah, I'm still here.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so on my end, I'm actually not seeing a strong connection coming through to your modem. It's possible there's an issue with the line itself coming into your home, or there could be a problem with the modem hardware.

Customer: Oh no. So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, let me try one more thing. Can you look at the modem again and tell me exactly which lights are on and which ones are off?

Customer: (pause) Okay, um, I see... there's a green light, and then there's an orange light that's still blinking. And then there's like, a couple of other lights but they're not lit up.

Agent: So the orange light is still blinking? It's not solid green?

Customer: No, it's still blinking orange.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, okay. That indicates it's still trying to sync. That should have gone solid by now. I think we may have an issue with the modem itself, or possibly with the line coming into your home. I'd really like to get a technician out to your place to take a look.

Customer: A technician? How long will that take? I really need my internet.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds, pause) The earliest I can get someone out is tomorrow morning between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? That's... (sigh) I mean, yeah, I guess it has to. Is there anything else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: Unfortunately, I think we've exhausted the basic troubleshooting steps. The line issue is beyond what we can resolve remotely. But the technician will be able to diagnose whether it's a problem with the modem, the line, or something else.

Customer: Alright. Yeah, okay. Go ahead and schedule that.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get you all set up. The technician will arrive tomorrow between 8 and 12. Can you make sure someone's home to let them in?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Great. Your confirmation number is F-47829. I'll also send you a text message and an email with all these details. Is the best number for you the one you called from?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Excellent. I apologize that we couldn't resolve this today, but I appreciate your patience. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
