# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I'm working from home today and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be, especially when you're trying to work. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. Your name is David Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Alright, David. So your internet went down this morning. Just so I can understand the situation better—are you getting any lights on your modem or router at all right now?

Customer: Uh, yeah, so there are some lights on the modem. I think there's a green one and then... (pause) ...there's like a red one blinking on the router.

Agent: Okay, that's actually helpful information. A red blinking light usually means it's not connecting to the modem. Have you tried restarting your equipment yet?

Customer: I did that. I unplugged everything for like a minute and plugged it back in, and it's still doing the same thing.

Agent: Alright. Let's try something a little different. Can you locate the reset button on your modem? It's usually a small button on the back.

Customer: The reset button? Um, let me see... (background rustling) Yeah, I see it, but if I press that, won't I lose all my settings?

Agent: Good question. You might need to reconfigure your WiFi network, but it could help get things communicating again. Before we go that route though, let me just verify a few things. Have you noticed any power outages in your area today, or any storms?

Customer: No, actually. Everything's been fine. It's just... it's weird because my phone still has internet from, you know, my cellular data, so I know it's not a widespread outage or anything.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. (pause) Okay, so let's try a different approach. I want you to unplug your modem—just the modem, not the router—and wait for about thirty seconds. Then plug it back in. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (background noise, unplugging sounds) Okay, unplugged... (pause) ...and waiting. This is... (longer pause) ...okay, plugging it back in now. (electrical hum)

Agent: Good. Now while that's booting back up, which should take about a minute or so, let me just ask—have you had any recent changes to your setup? Any new equipment, or did someone come out to your house recently?

Customer: Not that I know of. I mean, I've had the modem and router for probably... two years now? Maybe longer. Nothing's really changed.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let's give that another moment. Are you seeing any changes in the lights on your modem right now?

Customer: Um, let me look. (pause) Still the same, honestly. Green light, but the router still has that red light blinking.

Agent: Alright, and just to confirm—you're looking at a direct ethernet cable from your modem to your computer, or are you using WiFi?

Customer: I'm using WiFi. Should I try plugging in an ethernet cable instead?

Agent: Actually, that's not a bad idea. That would help us figure out if it's a WiFi issue or a broader internet connection issue. Do you have an ethernet cable available?

Customer: I think so. Let me check my drawer. (pause) Yeah, I found one. (sounds of cable being picked up)

Agent: Great. Go ahead and plug one end into your modem and the other end into your computer. Let me know once you've got it connected.

Customer: (pause, rustling) Okay, I've got it plugged in. (pause) But... I'm still not getting any internet connection. The ethernet light on my modem isn't even lighting up.

Agent: (pause) Hmm, that's... that's interesting. The ethernet light isn't lighting up at all?

Customer: No, nothing. It's just the green light and then the red one on the router.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check your account status from our end here. (pause) I'm showing that your service is active and everything looks normal on our network. The issue is definitely on your end. (pause) Okay, so at this point, I want you to try what we call a factory reset on your modem. I know we discussed this briefly, but I think we need to do it. Are you comfortable with that?

Customer: I guess so. What do I need to do?

Agent: There should be a small recessed button on the back of your modem. You'll need to hold it down with a paperclip or a pen for about ten to fifteen seconds. That will reset the modem to factory settings.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm... (pause) ...I'm pressing it. How long have I been holding it?

Agent: Just keep holding for a bit longer... (pause) ...okay, you can release it now.

Customer: (pause) The modem is doing something now. Lights are going crazy for a second. (longer pause) Okay, it's settled down again. Still the same thing though—green light, red light on the router.

Agent: (long pause) Okay, and the ethernet light... is that lighting up now?

Customer: No. Still nothing.

Agent: (pause) David, I want to be honest with you—at this point, it sounds like there might be a hardware issue with your modem. The fact that the ethernet port isn't responding at all, even after a factory reset, suggests the modem itself might be defective.

Customer: Oh man, really? So what does that mean? How long before I can get another one?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we can do here. (pause) I can definitely arrange to have a replacement modem shipped out to you. That would typically take about three to five business days depending on your location. However... (pause) ...I want to try one more thing before we go that route. Do you have a spare router or modem from an old setup that you could test with?

Customer: Uh, no. I don't think so. I mean, my neighbor has Frontier too, but I'm not gonna ask to borrow their modem.

Agent: (chuckles) I don't blame you. Alright, well, at this point I think we've exhausted the troubleshooting steps I can walk you through remotely. What I'd like to do is either schedule a technician visit to your home to diagnose the issue in person, or we can send you a replacement modem and see if that resolves it.

Customer: How long would it take for a technician to come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) It looks like we have an opening... two days from now in the afternoon. Would that work for you?

Customer: Two days? I really need my internet before that. I have a big project due tomorrow for work.

Agent: I completely understand. In that case, I'd recommend we go with the replacement modem. I can expedite the shipping at no extra charge since you've been a good customer. It should arrive by tomorrow or the day after.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I guess that's my best option then. But what am I supposed to do for internet today and tomorrow?

Agent: That's a great question. (pause) Unfortunately, I don't have a way to provide temporary internet access from here, but you could consider using your cellular data with a hotspot on your phone if you need to access anything urgent for work.

Customer: Yeah, I'll just have to do that and hope my data plan can handle it. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I know, and I'm really sorry we weren't able to get this resolved today. Let me get that replacement modem set up for you right now. (typing sounds) I have your address as... 447 Maple Street, apartment 3B, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got your replacement modem ordered for expedited shipping. You should receive it by Friday at the latest. When you get it, just follow the same setup process—plug in the power, wait for it to boot up, and connect your router to it.

Customer: And if that doesn't work?

Agent: (pause) Well, if the replacement modem doesn't work either, then we'd definitely need to schedule that technician visit. But I'm fairly confident this will resolve the issue. The modem you have now is showing signs of hardware failure.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Not on your end right now. You'll receive a shipping confirmation email within the next hour or so with tracking information. Just keep an eye on that. And David, I really apologize that we couldn't get you back online today. I wish I had better news for you.

Customer: It's not your fault. You guys tried. I guess I'll just see what happens when the new modem arrives.

Agent: Sounds good. And if you have any other issues or questions, don't hesitate to reach back out to us. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your patience. We'll get you back up and running soon.

Customer: Thanks. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, David. Take care now.
