Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out completely about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the router and everything.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. I see your account for... Michael Torres, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you're experiencing a complete outage right now—no internet at all?

Customer: Right. Nothing. My phone is connected to cellular data right now, which is why I can call you. But the modem, it's just... it's not doing anything. The lights aren't even turning on.

Agent: Okay, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me where your modem is located and if you can see it right now?

Customer: Yeah, it's in my office, sitting on the desk next to my router. And like I said, no lights on it at all. It's completely dead.

Agent: Got it. So the modem has no lights on it. Let me ask—is the power cable plugged into the modem itself?

Customer: (slight pause) Yeah, of course it is. I mean... let me just double-check. (pause) Yeah, it's plugged in.

Agent: And is the other end of the power cable plugged into a wall outlet or a power strip?

Customer: It's in a power strip. The power strip's definitely on though—I can see other stuff plugged into it is working fine.

Agent: Okay, good. Um, let me try a different approach here. Can you try unplugging the power cable from the modem for about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in? And just watch to see if any lights come on.

Customer: Okay, give me a second. (pause, rustling sounds) Alright, I'm unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, thirty seconds... (pause) Now I'm plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Do you see any lights coming on?

Customer: Uh... no. Still nothing. That's weird.

Agent: Hmm. And you're sure the outlet on the power strip is working? Like, you mentioned other devices are on—

Customer: Yeah, my lamp is on, my computer's running... the power strip is definitely working.

Agent: Okay. Let me try one more thing. Can you check if there's a power button on the modem itself? Sometimes they have a small button on the back or the side.

Customer: (pause) Let me see... I'm looking at the back... no, I don't see a power button. Just the ports and the power cable input.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm—this is the modem that Frontier provided, correct? It's not a personal device you purchased?

Customer: Right, it's the one you guys sent me. I've had it for... I dunno, maybe two years?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so we've got a Frontier-issued modem that's not powering on. This could potentially be a hardware failure. But before we go down that road, I want to try one more thing. Do you have a different outlet you could try? Just to completely rule out the power strip.

Customer: Yeah, I could try moving it to the outlet on the wall. (pause, shuffling sounds) Okay, I'm unplugging it from the power strip and... (pause) plugging it into the wall outlet now. (pause) Still nothing. No lights.

Agent: (long pause) Alright, that's not a good sign. It sounds like we might be dealing with a hardware issue with the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it remotely or...?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. If the modem isn't powering on at all, it's a physical issue. But let me check one more thing in your account here. (typing sounds) Let me see if there are any service alerts or outages in your area that might be related.

Customer: Is there an outage? I mean, that would make sense, wouldn't it?

Agent: That would actually explain it better, yeah. (pause, more typing) Let me check... okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area at this time. That's actually... (trailing off) ...not what I was hoping to find.

Customer: Great. So it's just my modem then?

Agent: It appears so, yeah. Look, I want to be thorough here, so let me ask—have there been any power surges or storms recently?

Customer: Um, actually, yeah. There was a pretty bad thunderstorm last night. Why?

Agent: Well, that could explain it. Power surges from storms can sometimes damage modem hardware. But here's the thing—if that's the case, we should be able to get you a replacement unit sent out.

Customer: Okay, so how long does that take?

Agent: (pause) So typically we can get a replacement modem to you within three to five business days. However, I do need to escalate this because you're without service. Let me get you to our technical support team who has the authority to process a replacement and potentially expedite it.

Customer: Wait, so you can't do it right now?

Agent: I'm not authorized to process hardware replacements—that has to go through our technical support team. But they'll be able to take care of you much faster. Okay, I'm going to transfer you now. It might take just a moment to connect.

Customer: Alright...

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm placing you through now. Your reference number is 447829-F. You can reference that if you need to follow up. Thank you for your patience with me today.

Customer: Yeah, thanks, I guess.

(hold music plays)

Agent 2: Hello, this is Frontier technical support, my name is Patricia. I have your account here and see we were working on a modem that's not powering on. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. The agent thought it might've gotten damaged in the storm last night.

Agent 2: Okay, I understand. And you've already tried the standard troubleshooting steps?

Customer: Yeah, we did—unplugging it, trying different outlets, everything.

Agent 2: Alright. Well, I want to verify something before we proceed with a replacement. Can you take a look at the modem one more time and just double-check if there's any visible damage—any burn marks, or if it looks wet at all?

Customer: (pause, rustling) Let me see... No, it looks fine. Doesn't look damaged. Just... not working.

Agent 2: Okay. (pause) And you're certain there's absolutely no power indicator light coming on at all?

Customer: None. I've tried everything you guys asked me to try. It's dead.

Agent 2: (long pause) You know what, I want to try one more diagnostic here. Can you—actually, wait. If there's no power to the unit at all, I won't be able to run a remote diagnostic. (pause) Alright, I believe you that the unit is not functioning. Given the storm and the symptoms you're describing, I think we are looking at a hardware failure.

Customer: So what's the next step then?

Agent 2: [inaudible] Let me see here... I can definitely send you a replacement modem. The issue is that we're currently experiencing a backlog with replacements, so I'm looking at about... (pause, typing sounds) ...seven to ten business days for delivery.

Customer: Seven to ten days? Are you serious? I don't have internet for over a week?

Agent 2: I completely understand your frustration. Let me see if there's anything I can do. (pause, more typing) Um... I'm not seeing any way to expedite this at the moment, but what I can do is add a courtesy credit to your account for the days you're without service while we get the replacement to you.

Customer: How much of a credit are we talking about?

Agent 2: I can add half of your monthly service charge for the month. So that would be about... (pause) ...thirty dollars.

Customer: That's... I mean, it's something, but it doesn't really solve my problem right now. Is there any other option?

Agent 2: (pause) Unfortunately, not really. The modem is hardware, and if it's not powering on, we can't repair it remotely. And we don't have any loaner units available at the moment.

Customer: This is really frustrating. I work from home, and I need my internet working.

Agent 2: I completely understand. And I am truly sorry about this. This is definitely not the experience we want you to have. What I can do is make sure that when the replacement arrives, you have priority setup. I'll flag your account so when you receive it, you can call us back and we'll get you back online as quickly as possible.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, I guess that's... something.

Agent 2: I really am sorry, Mr. Torres. Is there anything else I can help clarify about the replacement or the timeline?

Customer: No, I guess not. So I should expect it in like... a week to ten days?

Agent 2: That's what I'm seeing right now, yes. But keep an eye on your email—we'll send you a tracking number as soon as it ships out. And you have my permission to call us back the moment you receive it so we can get you reconnected.

Customer: Alright. Thank you, I guess.

Agent 2: You're welcome, and again, I apologize. Have a good day, Mr. Torres.

Customer: Yeah, you too.
