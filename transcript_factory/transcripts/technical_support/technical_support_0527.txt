Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I'm working from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be, especially when you're trying to work. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm seeing an account here for... is this Michael Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you tried unplugging the modem and router yet?

Customer: Yeah, I did that like an hour ago. Unplugged everything for about a minute and plugged it back in. Nothing changed.

Agent: Okay, okay. And when you say it's down, you're not getting any connection at all, or is it just really slow?

Customer: No connection at all. I mean, the router's on—I can see the lights—but it's just... there's no internet. My laptop won't connect, my phone won't connect when I'm on WiFi.

Agent: Got it. So the lights on the modem are on, but you're not seeing an internet light? Like, is there a specific light that's... um... off or blinking red?

Customer: (pause) Well, there's like... one of the lights is blinking orange. I think it's the one on the left?

Agent: Okay, the one on the left that's blinking orange. That's typically the internet connection light, so that would explain what's going on. So we're gonna work through this together. First, I just need to check—have you had any storms in your area recently, or any power outages?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Weather's been fine all week.

Agent: Alright, good. Okay, so what I'm gonna have you do is locate the reset button on your modem. It's usually a small button that you might need a paperclip or something to press. Do you see that?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's like... recessed, right?

Agent: Exactly. Now, before we do this, I just want to let you know that this will reset your modem back to factory settings. So we might need to set it back up. But let's try it and see if we can get that orange light to turn blue.

Customer: Okay, I'm gonna press it now. (pause) I'm holding it... how long?

Agent: Hold it for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's resetting. I can see the lights going crazy. (pause) ...There we go. Now it's... hmm, it's still blinking orange.

Agent: Still orange?

Customer: Yeah.

Agent: Okay, um... (pause) Let me just put you on a quick hold while I check our system to see if there's anything on our end. Should only be a minute or two.

Customer: Sure, go ahead.

Agent: Thank you. (hold music plays briefly) (returns) Hey, Michael, I'm back. So I'm not seeing any outages in your area, and your modem's showing as online from our end, which is... that's actually a little strange. But it might be a modem issue then. Um, before we go down that road, can you try one more thing for me? Can you unplug the modem again, but this time also unplug the power cord from the wall outlet, not just the modem itself?

Customer: Oh, okay. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged. How long should I wait?

Agent: Give it about thirty seconds. Just let it sit.

Customer: (pause) Alright... (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) Let me plug the power cord back into the wall. (pause) It's starting up again. Okay, the lights are coming back on... and... nope. (frustrated) Still orange.

Agent: Still orange. Okay, um... (pause) This is unusual. So you've done the reset, you've done the full power cycle... Let me check something. When you look at your router, the separate device, what lights do you see on that?

Customer: Oh, the router? Um, it's got like... a power light that's green. And then there's a WiFi light that's green. And then there's like an internet light that's... also blinking orange.

Agent: [inaudible] ...same color on the router. Okay. Alright, so it sounds like the issue might be with your modem itself. The fact that we're not seeing a connection come through, even though it's showing as online in our system, suggests to me that there might be a hardware failure. I hate to say it, but we might be looking at having to replace the modem.

Customer: Wait, really? Like, the whole modem's just... broken?

Agent: I mean, it could be. But before we go that route, um... do you have the option to check an ethernet connection? Like, do you have an ethernet cable?

Customer: An ethernet cable? Um... I think I have one somewhere. It's been a while since I've used one, but... let me look.

Agent: That would be super helpful. That way we can rule out whether it's a WiFi issue or if it's the modem itself.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I found one. It's in a drawer in my desk.

Agent: Great. Can you plug one end into the back of the modem and the other end into your laptop?

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it in to the modem... now to the laptop... (pause) ...Nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: Still nothing? Alright. Did your computer recognize that you plugged something in?

Customer: I don't think so. There's no prompt or anything. Let me check the settings... (pause) [inaudible] ...no, there's no ethernet connection showing up. It's like the modem isn't even... it's not even trying to connect.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, okay. So here's what I'm thinking. We've ruled out pretty much everything we can on your end. We've power-cycled the modem, we've reset it, we've tried WiFi, we've tried a hardwired connection. The modem's not establishing a connection with our network, even though our system says it's registering. This really does sound like a modem hardware failure.

Customer: So what do I do? Do I need to come pick up a new one?

Agent: Well, we can definitely get you a replacement modem. Let me check what I can do here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so given that you've been a customer for a while and you've walked through all these troubleshooting steps with me, I can expedite a replacement. But it would probably arrive in the next 2 to 3 business days.

Customer: (frustrated) 2 to 3 business days? I need this fixed today. I've got meetings I need to be on and everything.

Agent: I completely understand. Um, unfortunately, we don't have same-day delivery available for equipment. However, if you're near one of our Frontier retail locations, you might be able to pick up a modem today. Let me see if there's one near you. What's your zip code?

Customer: It's 47201.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so the nearest retail location to you is about... it looks like about eight miles away. They're open until 6 PM today. You could potentially go pick one up there if you want to do that.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I might do that. Can you set that up for me?

Agent: Um, what I can do is I can put in a note on your account that you're coming to pick up a modem. But I'd recommend calling the retail location directly to make sure they have one in stock right now. Do you have a pen handy?

Customer: Yeah, go ahead.

Agent: The number is 555-0198. Just ask for the customer service desk and they can let you know about modem availability.

Customer: Alright, 555-0198. Got it.

Agent: Perfect. And Michael, I apologize that we couldn't get this working for you today over the phone. I know that's frustrating.

Customer: Yeah, it's pretty frustrating, but... I guess I'll head over there.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: Of course. Thanks for being patient with me, and I'm sorry again for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
