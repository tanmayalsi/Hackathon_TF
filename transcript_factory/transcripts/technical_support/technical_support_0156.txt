Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what name is the account under?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 100 plan in the Riverside area. So your internet just stopped working this morning, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I was working from home and it just... went out. One second it was fine, the next second, nothing. The modem's not even showing any lights or anything.

Agent: Okay. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. First, I want to make sure we have the right modem. What model is it? There should be a label on the front or back.

Customer: (pause) Um, let me look. It says... FR-G2000?

Agent: Great, that's one of ours. Now, can you check if the power cable is firmly connected to both the modem and the wall outlet?

Customer: (background noise of someone moving around) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. The power cable looks connected to me... let me... (sound of something being moved) ...okay, it's definitely plugged in.

Agent: Good. And do you see any lights at all on the modem? Sometimes the power light might be dim.

Customer: No, nothing. It's completely dark. Not even a little glow or anything.

Agent: Alright. Let's try a power cycle. Can you unplug the power cable from the modem right now?

Customer: (sound of something being unplugged) Done.

Agent: Okay, leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. I'll wait right here with you.

Customer: (pause) Okay... it's been like thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Alright, plugged back in. (pause) Still nothing. No lights at all.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's unusual. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) How long have you had this modem?

Customer: Uh, I'm not sure exactly. Maybe two years? It came with my service when I switched over to Frontier.

Agent: Okay, and other than this morning, have you had any issues with it recently? Any disconnections or slowness?

Customer: No, not really. It's been working great actually. This is the first time it's done anything like this.

Agent: Alright. Let me ask you this—do you have a second power outlet you could try? Sometimes it's not the modem, it's the outlet itself. Could you unplug it and try a different outlet?

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I can try that. Let me take it over here... (pause) ...okay, I'm plugging it into an outlet in my kitchen. (sound of plugging in) (long pause) Still nothing, Derek. No lights at all.

Agent: Okay, I appreciate you trying that. Let me check your account. There's no service outage in your area that I can see. However, with the modem not powering on at all, it's looking like we might be dealing with a hardware issue. Is there any chance the modem got unplugged during a storm or something? Any power issues in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was fine when I went to bed. I came down this morning to work and it was just off. I don't know what happened.

Agent: (pause) Alright. I'm going to be honest with you—when a modem isn't powering on at all and a different outlet doesn't help, it's typically a sign that the device itself has failed. It could be the power supply inside or something else internally.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Can you send me a new one?

Agent: Absolutely, we can do that. I can ship out a replacement modem to you. Normally we'd have one out within 2 to 3 business days. However, since you're without service, let me see if I can expedite this. (typing sounds) 

Unfortunately, our expedited shipping is going to add about a day, so we're looking at potentially 1 to 2 business days, but that's the best I can do on short notice. Would that work for you?

Customer: Two days without internet? I work from home, Derek. I really can't... is there anything else we can try? There's gotta be something.

Agent: (pause) I understand completely. Let me think here... Okay, the only other thing I can suggest is if you have any friends or family nearby with a modem you could borrow temporarily? And with the modem you borrow, you'd just need to call us back and we can update your account to recognize it. But I understand that might not be feasible.

Customer: Hmm, I don't think so. My sister has cable internet, not Fiber, so it probably won't work, right?

Agent: That's correct—the modems are specific to our service. Let me see if there's anything else on my end. (typing sounds) One moment, please.

(hold music, approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Thank you for holding. I spoke with my supervisor, and unfortunately we don't have any other options available. With the modem showing absolutely no power, there's really no way for us to troubleshoot further without the hardware being replaced. 

However, I did get approval to waive the shipping fee and apply a service credit to your account for the days you're without service. It's not a perfect solution, I know, but it's something.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... I mean, I appreciate the credit, but I just... I really need this working sooner rather than later. Is there any way to get it faster than two days?

Agent: I wish I had better news for you. Our fastest option right now is that 1 to 2 business days with expedited shipping, and that's already been approved. The warehouse would be shipping out today, and depending on your location, you could see it as early as tomorrow evening.

Customer: Tomorrow evening? Could I possibly get it tomorrow?

Agent: There's a possibility, yes. It depends on processing time at the warehouse and your proximity to our distribution center. But I can't guarantee it. When I place this order, I can add a note requesting priority processing, and I can make sure it's marked for expedited delivery.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Please do that. I mean, I guess that's the best we can do.

Agent: I'm going to get that started for you right now. (typing sounds) I'm going to need to confirm your shipping address. What's the best address to send this to?

Customer: It's 447 Maple Drive, Riverside, CA 92505.

Agent: (typing sounds) 447 Maple Drive, Riverside, California 92505. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, I've submitted the replacement modem with expedited shipping and a priority processing note. You should receive a tracking number via email within the next hour or so. And like I mentioned, you're looking at potentially tomorrow evening, but it could take until Wednesday depending on timing.

Customer: Alright. And when I get the new modem, I just plug it in and it should work?

Agent: Yes, pretty much. Plug it in, let it boot up—you'll see the lights come on—and it should automatically connect to our network. Your service should resume within a few minutes of that. If for any reason you have trouble, just give us a call back and we'll help you get set up.

Customer: Okay, I guess that's the best I can do right now. I'm not happy about losing a day or two of internet, but I appreciate you trying.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, James, and I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this today. I know this isn't ideal, especially when you work from home. Just keep an eye out for that email with the tracking information, and hopefully you'll have service restored very soon.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. I will.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day, James.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
