# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out completely. Like, it's just... it's not working at all. I've got nothing.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll get this sorted out for you. Let me pull up your account really quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, thank you James. I've got you here. So your service went down today?

Customer: Yeah, like maybe an hour ago? I was working from home and just... everything just stopped. The Wi-Fi router, it's just dead.

Agent: Okay, that's frustrating. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the modem powered on?

Customer: Uh, let me go look at it. (pause) Yeah, the modem's on. I can see... there's lights on it, but they're not... they're like, the wrong color, I think?

Agent: Okay, that's actually helpful information. What color are the lights?

Customer: Um... they're red. Is that bad?

Agent: Red typically means there's no connection. Let me walk you through a quick reset. Can you locate the power cable on your modem?

Customer: Yeah, I see it.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and unplug it for me, and then we'll wait about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. How long do I wait?

Agent: Just about thirty seconds. That'll clear out the modem's memory. While we're waiting, have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. Service has been pretty solid actually. It's just really weird that it just dropped like this.

Agent: Yeah, that is unusual. Alright, go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (typing sounds in background) Let me see what happens...

Agent: It'll take a minute or two to boot back up. While that's happening, is your gateway unit giving any lights at all? That's the box that might be separate from your modem.

Customer: Uh, I only see the one box. I think that's both?

Agent: That's fine. That's our all-in-one unit. (pause) Are you seeing any changes yet?

Customer: (pause) No, it's still all red. Like, nothing's changed.

Agent: Alright, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) James, I'm not showing any outages in your area currently. Let me try a different approach. Can you locate a small reset button on your modem? It's usually recessed.

Customer: Reset button... yeah, I see something like that. There's a tiny little hole with a button.

Agent: Perfect. That's the one. I'm going to need you to hold that down for about fifteen seconds while the modem is powered on. You might need a paperclip or something thin to reach it.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause) Yeah, I've got a paperclip. (pause) So I just... press it in?

Agent: Exactly. Hold it in for fifteen seconds. This'll do a factory reset on the modem.

Customer: (pause) Alright, holding it... ten... fifteen... (pause) Okay, I let go.

Agent: Good. Now the modem's going to restart completely. This can take a few minutes. Let's give it about three minutes to come back online.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) So while we wait, um... if it doesn't come back on, what does that mean? Like, is my modem broken?

Agent: Well, there could be a few things going on. Could be the modem itself, could be a line issue outside. But let's see if this reset helps first. (pause) Any lights changing yet?

Customer: Uh... (pause) No, still red. Maybe a little dimmer? But still red.

Agent: Still red, okay. Sometimes it takes a bit longer. Let's give it another minute. (pause) So how long have you been a Frontier customer, James?

Customer: About... three years now, I think?

Agent: Great. And you've had pretty good service up until today?

Customer: Yeah, like I said, no problems. This is definitely the first issue I've had.

Agent: That's good to hear. Alright, let's check in again. Anything different on the modem?

Customer: (pause) Um... no, it's still... it's still all red. The lights aren't changing to green or anything.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to be honest with you, James. When we do a factory reset and it's still not showing connection lights after several minutes, it usually indicates either a problem with the modem itself or a service interruption on the line. Let me check our system to see if there's anything on our infrastructure side. (typing sounds, longer pause)

Customer: (pause) How long does this usually take?

Agent: Just a moment. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the diagnostics on your line, and... actually, that's interesting. I'm not seeing any active connection from your modem to our network at all. That could mean the modem isn't communicating with us.

Customer: So what does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: It could be that, or it could be a problem with the physical line coming into your house. Have you noticed any damage to any cables outside? Any loose connections?

Customer: No, I... I haven't been outside, but I mean, I didn't do anything different. I didn't touch anything.

Agent: Right, I understand. (pause) Okay, let me see if I can remotely reboot the modem one more time from our end. That sometimes works when a manual reset doesn't. (typing sounds)

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (pause) I'm initiating that now. Can you watch the modem for me?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it. (pause) Okay, so... it just went dark for a second. Now the lights are back on, but... (pause) still red. Same as before.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I was afraid of that. James, here's what I think we need to do. I'm not able to restore your service over the phone at this point. I think we're looking at either a hardware issue with the modem or a line-side issue that needs to be checked in person.

Customer: Oh, come on. You mean I have to wait for a technician to come out?

Agent: I know it's not ideal, but yeah, I think that's our best option here. Let me get you scheduled. We have availability tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we could do Thursday morning between 8 and 12.

Customer: (sigh) Tomorrow's better, I guess. I'm working from home and I really need this fixed.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get you set up for tomorrow. You'll get a call from the technician about a half hour before they arrive. Is the number I have on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, 555-0147 is fine.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, you're all set for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM. The tech will give you a call to confirm. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess... I just hope it gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: We'll get you back online. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone, but our technician will definitely be able to diagnose what's going on. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, James, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Yeah, thanks.

Agent: You have a good day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
