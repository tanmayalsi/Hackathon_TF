# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out completely. I've got no connection at all, and I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Alright, I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. So you've got no internet connection at all right now, is that correct?

Customer: That's right. Everything just stopped working about twenty minutes ago. I was working from home and suddenly the connection just died.

Agent: Okay, I understand. That's definitely frustrating. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you seeing any lights on your modem right now? It's the white box, usually has a Frontier logo on it?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, I can see it. There's... let me look. The power light is on—it's green. But the internet light, the one that's usually blue, it's not on. It's just... off.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on but the internet indicator is dark. That's helpful information. And do you have any other lights on there? Maybe a WiFi light or anything blinking?

Customer: Just the power light. Everything else is dark.

Agent: Got it. Alright, let's try a few things. First, I'd like you to unplug the modem completely. Just pull the power cable out of the back.

Customer: (pause) Okay, doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I'd like you to wait about thirty seconds. Just... let it sit there.

Customer: Uh, how long has it been?

Agent: Just count to about thirty. We're giving the modem a chance to fully reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay... thirty seconds. Now what?

Agent: Alright, plug it back in for me.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait for it to boot back up. This usually takes about two to three minutes. Just watch those lights and tell me when they come back on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching. The green light just came back on. (pause) Now there's a white light blinking... (longer pause) Okay, the internet light is... it's amber now? Is that normal?

Agent: Amber is actually normal during startup. That means it's connecting. Give it just another moment.

Customer: (pause) It's been like thirty seconds and it's still amber.

Agent: That's alright. Sometimes it can take up to three minutes total. Let's give it another minute or so.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been a minute. Still amber. Should I try to connect to the WiFi or...?

Agent: Not yet. Let's just wait a little longer. (pause) Is it changing at all?

Customer: No, it's still just... amber. It's not moving.

Agent: Okay, James, that's a little unusual. Let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) Hmm. (pause) I'm actually seeing some activity on your line here, so the modem is communicating with our network. Can you try opening a web browser and seeing if you can access anything?

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me try. (pause) No, nothing's loading. I'm trying to go to Google and it's just... spinning. Nothing's happening.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else. Can you check the cable connections on the back of the modem? There should be a cable coming in from the wall—it's usually yellow. Can you make sure that's plugged in securely?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it. (pause) The yellow cable is plugged in. It looks pretty secure to me.

Agent: Okay. And just to be thorough, is there anything else plugged into the modem right now? Any other cables?

Customer: Just the power and the yellow cable from the wall. That's it.

Agent: Got it. (pause) Let me check something on my end again. (typing sounds, longer pause) James, I'm showing that the line has intermittent signal. That could explain what's happening. The modem is trying to connect but it can't maintain a stable connection. Have you had any work done on your line recently? Any construction or anything like that in your area?

Customer: Um... not that I know of. It was working fine this morning. Actually, there were some Frontier trucks in the neighborhood yesterday, now that I think about it. Could that be related?

Agent: It's possible. They might have been doing some maintenance. (pause) Okay, I have a couple more things we can try. Can you unplug the modem again?

Customer: Again? (pause) Okay, yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: This time, I'd like you to unplug the yellow cable from the back of the modem as well. Just for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, both are unplugged now.

Agent: Good. Just give it thirty seconds again.

Customer: (pause) Okay... thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Alright, plug the yellow cable back in first.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Done.

Agent: Now plug the power cable back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, power's back in. (pause) Power light is on again. (pause) The internet light is... amber again.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let's give it the full boot cycle again.

(longer pause)

Customer: (pause) Still amber. It's been like two minutes now and it's still not going blue.

Agent: I'm looking at your line here, and James, I think what we're dealing with is a signal issue on our end. The line is getting disconnected and reconnected repeatedly, which is why the light isn't going solid blue. This isn't something a modem reset is going to fix.

Customer: So... what does that mean? What do I do?

Agent: It means there's likely a problem with your connection from our network to your house. It could be the line itself, or it could be something at our local distribution point. Unfortunately, this is going to require a technician to come out and investigate.

Customer: Oh, great. (frustrated) How long does that take? I need my internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds, pause) I can schedule a technician to come out tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need it today if possible.

Agent: (pause) Let me check if there's any same-day availability. (pause) I'm not showing any open slots for today, I'm sorry. Tomorrow morning is the earliest we have. Would that window work for you?

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, I guess it has to. There's no way to fix this today though, right? Not over the phone?

Agent: Not with a signal issue like this. A technician will need to physically check the line and the connection points. But they should be able to get you sorted out pretty quickly once they're there.

Customer: Okay. Fine. Schedule it for tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. That's tomorrow, [inaudible] between 8 AM and 12 PM. I'm going to put that in your account now. (typing sounds) Alright, James, you're all set. Your confirmation number is 847652. You should get a confirmation text and email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... no, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright. I apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today. Our technician tomorrow will definitely take care of you. You have a good day, James.

Customer: Thanks. Okay, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
