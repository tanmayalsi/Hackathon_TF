# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your phone number or account number?

Customer: Yeah, it's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm looking at your account now. And your name is Michael, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Okay Michael, so you're experiencing no internet at all, is that correct?

Customer: Right. I turned everything on this morning like I always do and nothing. The modem's... it's got some lights on it, but I'm not getting any connection on any of my devices.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let's start with the basics here. Can you tell me what lights are showing on your modem right now?

Customer: Um, there's a green light on the front, but it's not... I don't know, the internet light or whatever you'd call it, that one's not on. It's dark.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing the power light is green, but the internet light is off. That tells me the modem might not be getting a signal from our network. Let's do a quick restart. Can you unplug the modem for me?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Just leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds while I check a few things on my end here.

Customer: (pause) Alright. Is this... is this gonna take long? I've got a meeting at like noon.

Agent: I'm gonna do my best to get you back up and running quickly. We're just at about the twenty-second mark, so go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged it back in. (pause) Hmm, it's booting up now I guess.

Agent: Great. While that's cycling up, let me ask you—have there been any storms in your area recently? Or any recent power outages?

Customer: No, I mean, nothing that I noticed. It's been pretty normal weather. Why?

Agent: Just checking. Sometimes weather or power fluctuations can cause connection issues. Okay, what's the status now? Is that internet light coming on?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. The green light's solid but that other one... nothing.

Agent: Alright. Let me take a closer look at our network on this end. (typing sounds) Hmm, okay. I'm showing that we're not detecting a signal going to your modem currently. That could indicate a few different things. Have you noticed any loose cables or anything unusual with your setup?

Customer: No, I don't think so. Let me... (pause) No, it all looks plugged in like it normally is.

Agent: Okay. What I'd like you to do is locate your cable line where it comes into your modem. That's the coaxial cable—it usually has a metal connector on the end.

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I see it.

Agent: Can you unscrew it just a little bit and screw it back in? Sometimes these connections can get slightly loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Alright, I tightened it up. Does that help?

Agent: (pause) Let me check the network... Unfortunately, I'm still not seeing a connection to your unit. This might indicate an issue with the line from the street or from our network termination point. Have you had any work done on your home recently? Any contractors or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. This just happened overnight basically.

Agent: Right. Okay, let me try one more thing. I'm going to power cycle the modem from my end here to see if that helps reestablish the connection. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm doing that now. Give it about two minutes to restart completely.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, I'm waiting... (pause) Still nothing. Same situation.

Agent: I understand how frustrating this must be. Let me be honest with you—based on what I'm seeing here, it looks like there may be an issue with the physical line or equipment outside your home. I'm not detecting any signal coming from our network to your location at all, and that's typically something that requires a technician to investigate on-site.

Customer: (pause) So you can't fix this over the phone?

Agent: Unfortunately not in this case. But what I can do is schedule a technician to come out and take a look. They can check the exterior wiring, the connection from the street, and all that. Do you have availability for someone to come out this week?

Customer: I... when could they come? I really need this working ASAP.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm showing we have availability tomorrow afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow's Saturday though. Is there anything earlier? This morning?

Agent: I'm sorry, our next available time slot is tomorrow between 1 and 5. Or I could put you down for Monday morning if you prefer.

Customer: (pause) No, tomorrow's fine, I guess. I just... I mean, this is frustrating. Everything was working fine yesterday.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize. We'll get someone out there to identify what's causing this. Can you confirm the service address on file? It should be 847 Willow Court?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So I have you scheduled for tomorrow, Saturday, between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive. Is the phone number they'll be calling the one we're using right now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that works.

Agent: Great. I'm going to send a confirmation email to the address on file. The service call is going to be $99 since this isn't a connectivity issue related to your account or billing. Does that work for you?

Customer: $99? For a technician to come look at something that might be on your end?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Unfortunately, if it's a service call for external line issues, that does carry a service fee. However, if the technician determines it's an issue on Frontier's infrastructure, we can absolutely waive that fee.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I guess that's... fine. Just do it.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for your patience with me today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess that's it.

Agent: Alright, you're all set. Someone will be out to you tomorrow afternoon. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks.

Agent: Have a good one.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye.
