Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I see your account here under... Robert Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. And just to confirm, you're calling about your fiber internet service at 428 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went out this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router? Are they powered on?

Customer: Um, let me check. I'm looking at it right now. So I've got... the modem is showing a red light on the front, and it's just kind of pulsing. The router next to it looks normal though, I think. It's got some blue lights on it.

Agent: Okay, so the red pulsing light on the modem—that typically indicates there's a connection issue or the modem is searching for signal. Let's try a quick restart. Can you unplug the modem for me and just wait about 30 seconds?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (background noise of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. While we're waiting, have you had any recent storms in your area, or have you noticed any physical damage to the cables outside your home?

Customer: No, no storms. Everything seems... I mean, the weather's been fine. I don't think anything's damaged, but honestly I haven't really looked that closely.

Agent: That's alright. Go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Okay, it's back in. Now what?

Agent: Alright, so it's going to take about a minute or two to boot back up. While it's doing that, can you tell me if anything changed recently? Did you move the modem, install any new equipment, or have any work done at your home?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine yesterday. I was streaming and everything was... it was fine.

Agent: Got it. And what color is the light on the modem now?

Customer: It's still red. It's still pulsing like it was before.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Still red. Um, let me check something on the network side here. (typing sounds) I'm seeing that your modem is actually showing as offline in our system as well, which confirms there's an issue with the connection between your modem and our network.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it something I can fix?

Agent: Well, there are a few things we can try. Let me have you check the coaxial cable—that's the cable that connects from the wall outlet to the modem. Can you make sure it's screwed in tightly on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... okay, I'm checking now. (pause) It looks pretty tight to me. I mean, I'm not like, wrenching it with a wrench or anything, but it's... it seems secure.

Agent: Right, right. Don't force it. Okay, and is the cable damaged at all? Any visible cracks or kinks?

Customer: No, looks fine. It's just a regular cable running along the wall.

Agent: Alright. Can you try unplugging that cable from the modem and plugging it back in? Sometimes it needs to be reseated.

Customer: (background noise, pause) Okay, I unplugged it and... (pause) ...plugging it back in now. It's in. The light is still... still red.

Agent: (sigh) Let me try another approach here. I'm going to send a signal refresh to your modem. This should only take a minute. Just bear with me. (typing sounds, longer pause) Okay, that's been sent. Can you tell me if the light changes?

Customer: (long pause) Um... no, still red. It's actually kind of concerning me at this point.

Agent: I understand. Let me check our network status in your area to see if there's anything going on on our end that might be causing this. (typing sounds, pause) I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, so it seems to be isolated to your connection.

Customer: So what does that mean? Do you think it's the modem itself that's broken?

Agent: It's possible. But before we go down that road, let me try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset of the modem? There should be a small button on the back. You might need a paperclip or something small to press it.

Customer: (pause) A factory reset? Won't that... I don't know, mess things up?

Agent: No, it's completely safe. It'll just reset the modem back to its default settings and it should re-establish the connection. Do you have something you can use to press the button?

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (background noise, rustling sounds) I got a pen. I'm looking at the back now... (pause) Okay, I see a small hole. Is that it?

Agent: That should be it. Go ahead and press it for about 15 seconds while the modem is powered on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm pressing it... (pause) ...still pressing... (pause) ...and... I'm done. (pause) Now it looks like it's restarting. All the lights are kind of cycling through colors.

Agent: Good, that's what we want to see. Let's give it another two minutes to fully boot up and reestablish connection.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, um, it's still doing the light thing. Red, green, red, green... [inaudible]

Agent: Okay, just let it finish cycling through. That's normal.

Customer: (pause) Alright, so it's been doing this for a while now. Like, over a minute. Is that... is that normal?

Agent: It should settle down soon. Let's give it another minute.

Customer: (pause) Okay, Derek, I gotta be honest with you. I'm looking at it right now and it's still cycling. It's not settling down. The red light is back to just pulsing like before.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I see. Okay. Let me... let me check the status on my end again. (typing sounds, longer pause) Hmm. Robert, I'm still not seeing your modem connect to the network. 

Customer: So we're back where we started?

Agent: Unfortunately, yeah. We are. I've gone through all the standard troubleshooting steps and... it's not connecting. At this point, it's either a problem with the modem hardware itself, or there could be an issue with the line coming into your house.

Customer: Can you tell which one it is?

Agent: Not from here, unfortunately. We would need to send a technician out to your location. They can do an in-person diagnostic and see if it's the modem or the line. Depending on what they find, it could be covered under your service agreement, or you might need to replace the modem.

Customer: How long would that take? When could they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our scheduling. We have availability... it looks like we could get someone out there tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or if you need it sooner, we might be able to get someone later today, but it would be a bit of a wait. Could be 4 or 5 hours from now.

Customer: (sigh) I really need this fixed. Can you do today?

Agent: Let me see what I can do. (pause, typing sounds) I can put you down for a service visit today around 3 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, 3 PM works. I'll be here.

Agent: Excellent. The technician will give you a call about 30 minutes before they arrive. Is the number on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell phone. That's fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you, and I'm also going to send you a text message with a confirmation number and some details. In the meantime, just leave the modem powered on so the technician can take a look at it.

Customer: Okay. So nothing else I can try?

Agent: I wouldn't recommend trying anything else at this point. I think the technician will be your best bet. They'll have the right equipment and can determine what's actually going on.

Customer: Alright, well... I guess I'll just have to wait then.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get you back online today, Robert. But the technician should have you up and running. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Great. Well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get this taken care of for you today.

Customer: Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
