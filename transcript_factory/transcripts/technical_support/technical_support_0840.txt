Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls coming up and it's kind of a mess right now.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm looking at your account now. And just to confirm, you're calling from a mobile device right now, correct?

Customer: Yeah, I'm on my cell phone because the internet's completely down at my place.

Agent: Understood. So first things first, let's do some basic troubleshooting. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Do you have any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um, yeah, so the modem is... let me go look at it. (pause) Okay, so the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light, the one that usually blinks, it's... it's red. It's just solid red.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The red light typically means there's no connection coming into the modem. Have you had any recent storms or anything like that in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine last night, and then I woke up this morning and it was just... gone.

Agent: Alright. Let me have you try a couple of things. First, can you unplug the modem from the power outlet? Just pull it out completely.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Good. And while we wait, can you also unplug your router? That's the separate device, usually a little bit smaller.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. Unplug that too? Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Let's wait about 30 seconds and then we'll plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (pause) Alright, 30 seconds is up.

Agent: Go ahead and plug the modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in. (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait for it to fully boot up. This should take about a minute or two. While we wait, have you noticed any physical damage to the modem? Any loose cables or anything?

Customer: No, everything looks fine from what I can see. The cables all seem connected... (pause) Okay, so the power light is still green, but the internet light is still red. It's been a minute now.

Agent: Hmm, it should have started blinking by now if it was just a temporary connection issue. Can you check the cable that goes from the modem to the wall outlet? That's usually a coax cable, kind of thick with a metal connector on the end?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. Let me... (pause) It looks pretty tight to me. Like it's screwed in pretty good.

Agent: Okay, try unscrewing it gently and then screwing it back in. Sometimes these can come loose without you realizing it.

Customer: (pause) Alright, unscrewing it. (pause) Okay, it's back on. Let me see if anything changed with the lights... Nope. Still red.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Let me check something here. I'm not seeing any service alerts in your area, so it doesn't appear to be a widespread outage. Let me check on your account status... (pause) It looks like everything on our end is active and good to go. 

Customer: So it's something on my end then?

Agent: Well, it seems that way, but let's keep troubleshooting. Go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Good. And while that's booting up, let me ask—have you had any recent technician visits? Anyone working on your lines or anything?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I mean, there were some workers in the neighborhood like two days ago? But that was just utility stuff, I think.

Agent: That could potentially be relevant. Sometimes if they're working nearby, they might... well, let me ask you this. Have you tried restarting your computer or checking a different device?

Customer: (pause) I mean, my computer is the issue, right? Like it's not connecting to Wi-Fi. But I could try my phone... (pause) No, my phone can't connect either. So it's definitely the internet connection itself.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. Okay, um... (pause) Let me try one more thing here. In looking at your modem, do you see any buttons on the front that might have been accidentally pressed? Sometimes there's a reset button that can get pressed without someone realizing it.

Customer: Let me look... No, I don't think so. There's buttons but they all look normal to me.

Agent: Okay. (pause, typing sounds) You know what, I'm... I'm having a hard time diagnosing this remotely. The modem should be getting a signal and it's not. This could be an issue with the line coming to your house, or it could be something with the modem itself. At this point, I think we're going to need to get a technician out to your location to take a look.

Customer: Really? How long is that going to take? I told you I have work calls coming up.

Agent: I understand. Let me check availability for you. (pause, typing sounds) What's your availability looking like? Can someone come out today?

Customer: Today would be great, if possible. I mean, anything that works, really. I'm pretty flexible.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm showing availability this afternoon between 12 and 4 PM. Would that window work for you?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that works. I can be there.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule a technician visit for you today between 12 and 4 PM. Just to set expectations, the technician will check the line coming into your house and test the modem. If it's a hardware issue, there may be a charge, but if it's a line issue, that would be covered under your service.

Customer: Okay, that sounds... I guess that's fair. So someone will be there today?

Agent: Yes, you should receive a confirmation text message and email within the next few minutes with the details. The technician will have all of your account information. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully they can fix it today.

Agent: I understand, and I hope so too. I do apologize that we couldn't resolve this over the phone. We'll get you back up and running as soon as possible. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: You're welcome. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
