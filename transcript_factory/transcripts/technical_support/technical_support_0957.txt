# Frontier Communications Technical Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications technical support. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing your account here. You're in the Denver area, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Um, let me look. (pause) So the modem has... it's got a red light blinking on it. Everything else is just... dark.

Agent: Okay, the red light is actually what we need to focus on here. That typically indicates a connection issue. Let's try a few things. First, can you locate the power cable on the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I see it.

Agent: Great. Can you unplug it for me and just wait about 30 seconds? I know you mentioned you already did this, but let's do it together this time to make sure.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Yeah, it's off.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait... (pause) ...and go ahead and plug it back in. Sometimes these devices just need a fresh restart.

Customer: Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) It's booting back up now. I can see some lights coming on... there's green, blue... and... (pause) ...no, the red light's back.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's still showing a connection issue. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Are you able to see if there's a coaxial cable connected to the back of the modem? It's the thick cable that looks like a TV cable?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it now. It's... it looks like it's pretty snug, but let me try wiggling it.

Agent: Good idea. Sometimes they can come loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm jiggling it a bit... nothing seems to... (pause) ...wait, let me try unscrewing it and screwing it back in.

Agent: That's a great idea, actually. Go ahead.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's snug now. Let me look at the modem... (pause) ...still red. This is really frustrating. I've had this service for like three years with no problems.

Agent: I understand, and I appreciate your patience. Let me check if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end, which is... actually kind of interesting. Let me ask you this—do you have a router separate from your modem?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I do. There's like a separate WiFi thing.

Agent: Okay, can you check the lights on that as well?

Customer: (pause) It's completely dark. No lights at all.

Agent: Alright, so it's not getting power. Can you check if the power cable is—

Customer: —oh wait, I think I might see the issue. Hold on. (pause) Okay, the cable was... it wasn't all the way in. Let me... (pause) Okay, the router's back on now. There's lights coming on.

Agent: Great! Do you see any blue or green lights?

Customer: Yeah, I see... green and blue now. (pause) Okay, that's better. But my modem still has the red light.

Agent: Right, so the router is separate. The red light on the modem is still our issue. Let me ask—when you look at that modem, can you tell me the model number? It should be on a sticker on the back or bottom.

Customer: (pause) Let me flip it over... It says... FrontierNet Model... uh... G2415W?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, G2415W, I'm familiar with that one. Those are solid devices. So we've confirmed the coaxial cable is tight, correct?

Customer: Yeah, it's snug now.

Agent: And the power cable is definitely connected?

Customer: Yes, it's definitely plugged in.

Agent: Okay. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you hold down the reset button on the back of the modem for about ten seconds? It's a small button, you might need something like a pen or paperclip.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking for it... I see it. Okay, I'm holding it down. (pause) Ten seconds... (pause) Okay, I let go.

Agent: Perfect. Now the modem should be rebooting. This might take a couple minutes. Just give it some time and let me know when you see those lights change.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's... it's booting back up. I see some orange lights now... some green... (pause) ...and the red light is... (pause) ...still there. It's just... it's not going away.

Agent: Okay, I see. (pause) This is unusual. Let me check something else on my end here. (typing sounds) (longer pause) I'm pulling up your service line now...

Customer: What are you looking at?

Agent: I'm checking to see if there's a signal coming from our side to your location. (pause) Hmm, that's... actually, that's showing as abnormal. The signal strength is reading very low on our end.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It could be an issue with the line coming into your house, or it could be something more serious on our infrastructure side. Unfortunately, what I'm seeing suggests this might require a technician to come out and diagnose it properly.

Customer: Oh man, really? How long would that take?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) We do have a technician available tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need this fixed today. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm really sorry. Let me see if there's any same-day availability... (typing sounds) (pause) Unfortunately, our technicians are fully booked today. Tomorrow morning is the earliest I can get someone out to you.

Customer: (pause) That's... I mean, I guess I don't have a choice, right?

Agent: I truly apologize for the inconvenience. I know this is frustrating. The technician will be able to do a more thorough diagnostic than I can do over the phone. They'll check the line, they might replace some equipment if needed...

Customer: Okay, fine. Tomorrow morning then. What time exactly?

Agent: I'll schedule you for the 8 AM to 12 PM window. You'll get a confirmation call or email with more details. Can I confirm your phone number is 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And just to let you know, there's no charge for the service call since this is a potential infrastructure issue on our end. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I really appreciate your patience, and I apologize again that I couldn't resolve this over the phone. Our technician will take great care of you. Is there anything else I can help with today?

Customer: No, that's all.

Agent: Alright, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Have a good day.
