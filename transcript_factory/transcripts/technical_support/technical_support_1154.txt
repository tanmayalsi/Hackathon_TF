# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without it for like... two hours now? I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. I'll do my best to help you get back online. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get your name please?

Customer: It's David. David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Thanks for that. Alright, I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Okay, I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. Let me ask you a few questions to start troubleshooting. First, is your modem powered on? You should see some lights on the front of it.

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. Um, it's on, but... I mean, the lights are kind of weird. There's like a red light blinking on one side?

Agent: Okay, a red light. That's actually pretty common. So which lights are you seeing exactly? Are they on the front panel?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, on the front. So I see like a... there's a green light that's solid, but then there's this red one that keeps blinking. Is that bad?

Agent: (pause) Okay, so the green light being solid is good. That usually means it's powered on. The red blinking light though... that typically indicates there might be a connection issue with the fiber line. Before we go further, have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in? Sometimes that can resolve these things.

Customer: Oh, no I haven't. Let me try that real quick.

Agent: Sure, go ahead. I'll be right here.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Okay, unplugging it now... (pause, longer pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. So give it about thirty seconds to boot back up, and then let me know what the lights look like.

Customer: Yeah, okay, I'm watching it. (pause) Um... okay, so the green light is back on, but that red light is still blinking. It's doing the same thing.

Agent: Alright, thanks for trying that. Let me check a couple other things. Have there been any storms in your area recently, or has anything unusual happened today?

Customer: Not really, no. It was fine yesterday, you know? I was using it last night and everything was working perfectly. I woke up this morning and just... nothing.

Agent: Gotcha. And just to confirm, you're not able to connect any devices to WiFi right now? Or even if you plugged directly into the modem with an ethernet cable?

Customer: Well, I tried WiFi on my phone and nothing's coming up. And I don't have an ethernet cable on me right now, but... I don't think that's it anyway. Like, if the modem's not connecting, then it's not going to matter, right?

Agent: Actually, that's a good point, but testing with an ethernet cable would help us rule out whether it's a WiFi issue or a broader connection issue. If you could find one, it might help. But in the meantime, let me look at your account here. (typing sounds, pause) I'm checking our system to see if there's anything on our end causing this...

Customer: Take your time. I'm not going anywhere, unfortunately. (nervous laugh)

Agent: (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any outages in your area or any service interruptions on our end. That red light on your modem is really the key indicator here. Do you happen to know... have you had your modem for a while, or is it relatively new?

Customer: Uh, I think I've had it for maybe... three years? Maybe four? I'm not really sure. It came with the service when we switched over.

Agent: Okay, so it could potentially be a hardware issue with the modem itself. Let me try one more thing before we go down that route. Can you check the back of the modem? There should be some cables plugged in. I just want to make sure the fiber optic cable is firmly connected.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see the cables. There's like... there's a couple of them back here. One's thicker than the other.

Agent: Right, so you're looking for one that's thin and kind of clear or white, sometimes with a small cap on the end?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I see it. There's definitely one like that.

Agent: Okay, go ahead and gently unplug that one, and then plug it back in. You should hear a little click when it seats properly.

Customer: (pause) Alright, unplugging... okay, now plugging back in. (pause) I think I heard a click, yeah.

Agent: Good. Now go back and look at the modem lights again.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... the green light is still on, but that red light is still blinking. Same thing.

Agent: (sigh, pause) Okay, David. I appreciate your patience here. Let me put you on a very brief hold while I consult with our technical team to see if there's anything else we can try from here. Just one moment.

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (hold music, approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Okay, David, thanks for holding. So I spoke with our tech team, and given that we're not seeing anything on our end and that red light persists even after reconnecting everything, it does sound like it could be a hardware failure with your modem. The good news is, we can ship you a replacement modem at no charge, and it should arrive within two business days.

Customer: Two business days? (pause) That's... I mean, that's not ideal. I really need my internet. Is there anything else we can do?

Agent: I understand. Unfortunately, from what we've tried, the connection issue is persisting, and the red light indicator is suggesting a hardware problem. I can definitely expedite the modem replacement, but... I want to be honest with you, I don't have another troubleshooting step that would resolve this remotely.

Customer: Well, what if I just... I don't know, could someone come out to my place?

Agent: Absolutely, that's an option. I can schedule a technician visit for you. That would typically be within 24 to 48 hours depending on availability. There would be a $99 service call fee if the issue is determined to be customer-caused, but if it's on our end or equipment-related, that fee would be waived.

Customer: Okay, so... best case scenario, someone comes out tomorrow?

Agent: That's possible, yes. Let me check availability. (typing sounds) What day works best for you? We have morning and afternoon windows.

Customer: Uh, tomorrow morning if you can do it?

Agent: Let me see... (pause) I can get you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works. That's fine.

Agent: Perfect. You're all set for tomorrow morning. A technician will be out between 8 and noon. Is there anything else I can help you with today, David?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I hope so too. And if for any reason you'd like to go ahead and have that replacement modem shipped in the meantime as a backup, just let us know. We can certainly do both.

Customer: Yeah, actually, could you go ahead and send the replacement? Just in case.

Agent: Absolutely, I'll get that submitted for you right now. You should receive it within two business days. And just to recap, you've got a technician visit tomorrow morning, and you'll have a replacement modem arriving soon. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's good. Thank you for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, David. We really appreciate your patience today, and we'll get you back online as soon as we can. Thanks for choosing Frontier.

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye.
