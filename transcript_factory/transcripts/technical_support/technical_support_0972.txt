# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet is completely down. I've been without it since this morning and I really need to get it working. I work from home so this is kind of a big deal.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm sorry you're experiencing that. Let me help you get back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get your name?

Customer: It's James Chen.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. So your service went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 8 AM? I tried restarting my router but nothing changed.

Agent: Alright, that's good troubleshooting on your part. Before we go further, have you checked the modem and router? Are the lights on them lit up at all?

Customer: Yeah, so... the modem has like a red light on it, I think? And the router... I'm looking at it now... it's got some lights but they're not the usual green ones. They look kind of orange or yellow?

Agent: Okay, so the red light on the modem is definitely telling us something's going on. That usually means there's no connection coming from our end or the modem isn't communicating properly. Let me have you do something for me. Can you unplug the modem for about thirty seconds? Just pull the power cable out completely.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. And while we wait, just real quick—have there been any storms in your area recently? Sometimes that can cause issues.

Customer: No, actually the weather's been pretty nice. Clear skies all day.

Agent: Good to know. Alright, go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Let's give it about a minute to fully boot up. While that's happening, can you tell me—have you had any recent power outages or internet interruptions before this morning?

Customer: No, actually no. The connection has been rock solid for like the past month. This is really the first time.

Agent: That's helpful information. Okay, what are we seeing on the modem now? Any change in those lights?

Customer: Um... (pause) it's still showing the red light. And the router... same thing. Orange or yellow lights.

Agent: Alright. So the modem's still not getting a connection signal. Let me try something else. I'm going to send a signal out to your modem from our end here to see if we can refresh the connection. (typing sounds) I'm doing that now. Go ahead and just... wait about thirty seconds and tell me if anything changes.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) ...nope, nothing's changed. Still red.

Agent: Yeah, I'm not seeing a connection come back. Okay, let me ask you a few more questions. Is there anything between the modem and the wall outlet where the cable comes in? Any... I don't know, like furniture, or...?

Customer: No, I mean, the modem is pretty close to where the cable comes in. There's nothing blocking it or anything.

Agent: Okay, good. Can you check that cable for me? The one that goes from the wall into the modem? Just make sure it's... it's fully connected on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. The end at the wall looks pretty tight. Let me check the modem end. (pause) This one's... this one feels a little loose, actually. Hold on. (pause) Okay, I'm tightening it up.

Agent: Great. Now let's see if that helps. Give it a few seconds.

Customer: (pause) I'm watching the modem... (pause) ...no, it's still red. Still nothing.

Agent: Hmm, okay. This is frustrating, I know. Let me have you try a hard reset on the modem itself. There should be a small button, usually recessed, on the back or bottom. Do you see that?

Customer: Um... (pause) yeah, I see a little button back here. It's pretty tiny.

Agent: That's the one. I need you to hold that down for about ten to fifteen seconds. It's going to reset the modem back to factory settings.

Customer: Okay... (pause) I'm holding it down... (pause) how much longer?

Agent: ...few more seconds... and go ahead and release it now.

Customer: Okay, released. (pause) So now what?

Agent: Now we wait for it to fully reboot. This might take a couple of minutes. The lights should cycle through some different colors while it's starting back up.

Customer: (pause) I see some lights changing now. There's some blue lights... (pause) ...okay, now they're... (pause) ...and it's back to red. Just... just red again.

Agent: Okay, so we're still not getting a signal. I've got to be honest with you, James, what we're seeing here suggests that either the signal isn't reaching your location, or there's an issue with the modem hardware itself. Since the reset didn't fix it, I'm thinking it might be a modem issue.

Customer: So what does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: Possibly, yeah. But before we go down that road, I want to check something on my end. (typing sounds) Let me see if there are any outages in your service area... (pause, more typing) ...checking the network... (pause) I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported right now. Let me check the specific line to your address.

Customer: Okay, and...?

Agent: (pause) Hmm. I'm not seeing any alerts or outages flagged for your address either. But I am seeing that the modem hasn't connected to our network since about 7:52 this morning, which matches what you said.

Customer: So... what's the next step then?

Agent: Alright, so here's what I can do. We have a couple of options. One, I can schedule a technician to come out and check the line from the street to your modem, and they can also troubleshoot the modem itself. That would probably be the fastest way to figure out what's going on.

Customer: How soon could they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability... (pause) The earliest I have is... tomorrow afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. We also have a morning slot the day after that if that works better for you.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be better. Can we do that?

Agent: Absolutely. But I also want to mention—sometimes these issues can resolve themselves, so if you want, I can also send you a replacement modem. It would take about 3 to 5 business days to arrive, and you'd be without service until then unless the issue fixes itself.

Customer: Yeah, no, I think the technician visit is better. I can't wait that long without internet.

Agent: That makes sense. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got the appointment set up for tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will come out and check everything. They'll have your account information.

Customer: Got it. And if they can't figure it out?

Agent: Well, they'll try everything we can do from a hardware perspective. If it does end up being the modem, they can swap that out while they're there. If it's something with the line itself, they can take care of that too. I don't think you'll be waiting long once the tech gets there.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. Anything I should do in the meantime?

Agent: Um, just try the basic stuff—make sure everything's unplugged for a minute or two and plug it back in if you think of it. But honestly, I think we've done about all we can do on the phone here. The tech will get to the bottom of it tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, sounds good. So tomorrow between 1 and 5?

Agent: That's correct. You should receive a confirmation email at the address on your account, but I want to make sure you have our service number in case you need to reach out before the appointment. You can call back at the main support line, or if it's urgent, you can reference confirmation number 447829.

Customer: Got it. Thank you for your help, Derek. I know we couldn't get it fixed today, but I appreciate you trying.

Agent: Of course, James. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve it remotely, but I'm confident the technician tomorrow will take care of you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Yep, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
