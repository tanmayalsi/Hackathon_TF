# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Derek. Can I get your name and account number, please?

Customer: Yeah, hi. It's Tom Richardson. My account number is... (pause) it's 4-7-2-8-5-9-1.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Tom, I've got you here. I see you're on our fiber service in the Westchester area. What seems to be the issue today?

Customer: Yeah, so my internet just went out completely. Like, it's been out for the last... I dunno, maybe twenty minutes now? I was working from home and everything just stopped.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your service here. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is your modem powered on?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's powered on. I can see the lights... there's like a blue light on the front, but nothing else is really lighting up. It's usually got more lights on it.

Agent: Okay, so just the one blue light. That's actually the power indicator. The fact that you're only seeing that one light tells me the modem might not be detecting a connection from our network. Let me ask you—do you have a router separate from your modem, or is it all-in-one?

Customer: It's... I think it's separate? Yeah, there's two boxes. One's the modem and one's the router.

Agent: Okay, perfect. And is the router powered on as well?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks like it. It's got some lights on it too, but they're like... flashing red or orange? I'm not sure.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful information. So what I'd like you to do is we're going to do a quick power cycle. This resets both devices and usually resolves a lot of connection issues. Can you unplug the modem first—that's the one connected directly to the wall or your outlet?

Customer: Sure, yeah. (unplugging sounds) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's unplug the router as well.

Customer: Okay. (unplugging sounds) Both are unplugged now.

Agent: Perfect. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds while those power down completely.

Customer: (pause) ...Alright, thirty seconds. Are we good?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and plug the modem back in first. That's the one that connects to your wall outlet.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Okay, it's plugged in. Now what?

Agent: Give it about thirty seconds to boot up. You should start seeing some lights appear on the front of it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm seeing... yeah, I see a couple lights now. There's the blue one and now there's like a white light, I think. And maybe a green one?

Agent: Good, that's what we want to see. Now go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Done. How long do I wait now?

Agent: Give it about a minute to fully boot up and establish connection with the modem.

Customer: (pause, background sounds of waiting) Okay... I'm at about a minute now. Um, the router still has the orange and red lights though. Shouldn't those turn green or something?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, they should be. Let me ask you—are there any cables that might have come loose? Can you check behind both devices and make sure everything's plugged in tightly?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me look. (rustling sounds) Okay, so there's... I see the power cable, and then there's like a cord that connects the modem to the router. Let me check that one. (pause) Oh, it seems a little loose. Let me push it in.

Agent: Okay, try that.

Customer: (pause) I pushed it in. Still the same thing though. Red and orange lights.

Agent: Alright. Let me check on our end. (pause, typing) Tom, I'm not seeing any outages in your area right now, and your account isn't showing any service interruptions. Let me ask you... when the internet went out, did you see any storms or power issues at all?

Customer: No, it was just... out of the blue. No pun intended. (nervous laugh) Everything was fine and then it just stopped.

Agent: Understood. Okay, so I'm going to have you try one more thing. Can you locate the reset button on the modem? It's usually a small button, might be recessed.

Customer: (pause) Oh, I see it. There's like a tiny button on the back here.

Agent: Okay, what I want you to do is hold that down for about ten seconds. You might need a pen or paperclip to press it since it's recessed.

Customer: Right, let me grab a pen. (pause) Okay, I'm holding it down. (pause) How long was that?

Agent: About ten seconds should do it.

Customer: Okay, I let it go. (pause) Now there's... a lot of different lights cycling through. Is that normal?

Agent: Yeah, that's normal. That means it's going through its reset sequence. Give it a couple minutes to fully reboot. In the meantime, let me see if I can identify what might be happening here. (typing sounds)

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been about... I dunno, minute and a half now, and the lights are still kind of flickering. Some are green, some are yellow now.

Agent: (pause) Tom, I'm looking at your account and I'm not showing any signal coming in from our end. That's unusual. Let me ask you—is there a fiber box or cabinet anywhere outside your home that you know of?

Customer: Uh, I think there might be one? There's like some kind of box on the telephone pole near my house. I'm not sure if that's it.

Agent: That could be it. It's possible there's an issue with the connection between our network and your home. This would be something that we'd need to investigate on our side. (pause) Tom, here's what I'm thinking—I've run through the basic troubleshooting steps and your modem isn't establishing a connection with our network. That usually indicates an issue outside your home, possibly with the line itself or the distribution equipment.

Customer: Oh no, really? So what does that mean? How long until I get internet?

Agent: Well, what I'd like to do is escalate this to our technical team. They can send a technician to your location to check the line and the equipment. They'll be able to identify exactly what's causing the issue.

Customer: How long is that gonna take? I really need the internet today. I'm supposed to be working.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) So we have appointments available tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or later tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Ugh, tomorrow? Can't someone come out today?

Agent: I apologize, but all our technicians are currently booked for today. Tomorrow is the earliest I can get someone out. I know that's frustrating.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Yeah, this is... this is not great. Okay, fine. Let's do tomorrow morning. Eight to noon.

Agent: Alright, Tom, I'm going to get that scheduled for you. Just to confirm, that's tomorrow morning, 8 AM to 12 PM at your address. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I... I just hope they can actually fix it. This is pretty inconvenient.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Our technician will get this resolved for you. They're very skilled at identifying and fixing these kinds of issues. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, Tom. We appreciate your business, and I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today over the phone. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
