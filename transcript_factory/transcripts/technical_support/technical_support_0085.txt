Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've already tried unplugging the modem and everything.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. And your name?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Great, James. Thanks for that. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage right now, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. No lights on the modem or anything. Well, I mean... there's one light that's been blinking red, but that's it.

Agent: Okay, a red blinking light. That's actually pretty helpful information. That usually indicates either a connection issue or a problem with the equipment. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Have there been any recent storms in your area, or have you had any power outages?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The power's been fine. It just... stopped working.

Agent: Alright. And when you unplugged the modem, how long did you leave it unplugged before plugging it back in?

Customer: Um, I'd say about thirty seconds? Maybe a minute. Should I have waited longer?

Agent: That's actually usually sufficient, but let me have you try that again for me. This time, leave it unplugged for about three to five minutes. That'll give it a full reset.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (sounds of movement, then silence for a few seconds) Alright, it's unplugged. I'll just... wait here?

Agent: Yeah, just give it a few minutes. While you're waiting, let me ask—did anything change before the internet went out? Like, did you add any equipment, or were there any power surges or anything unusual?

Customer: No, nothing. It was working fine this morning. I was working from home, using it all day, and then around 4 o'clock it just died. Really weird.

Agent: That is strange. (typing sounds) Okay, go ahead and plug that modem back in for me.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) Alright, it's in.

Agent: Great. Now, we're going to wait for it to boot back up. That usually takes about two to three minutes. While we wait, let me check if there are any service issues in your area.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) You know, actually, I'm not showing any reported outages on our end in your neighborhood. Which is a good sign, because that means it's likely something specific to your equipment.

Customer: Right, yeah... (pause) So, um... how much longer do you think?

Agent: Let's give it just another minute or so. What you should be looking for is... do you see any green lights come on?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) No, still just that one red blinking light. Actually, wait... now I'm seeing another light come on. It's amber or yellow or something.

Agent: Okay, that's progress. The yellow light typically means it's trying to connect or... it's in the initialization phase. Let's give it another minute and see if that changes to green.

Customer: (pause) Okay.

Agent: (pause) So, James, just while we're waiting here... how long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, I'd say about four years now? Ever since I moved to this place.

Agent: Nice. And have you had any issues like this before, or is this your first time?

Customer: No, this is the first time. The service has actually been pretty solid up until now.

Agent: Well, I appreciate you saying that. (pause) Alright, let's check in on those lights again. What are you seeing now?

Customer: Um... still yellow. Maybe a little different shade but... still not green.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Let me try something else. Can you check if the cable coming into the modem is secure? Sometimes if it gets jostled or loosened, it can cause connection issues.

Customer: (sound of movement) Let me see... yeah, the cable looks tight. I'm giving it a little wiggle here... (pause) Still nothing.

Agent: Alright. (pause) And you said you're getting power to the modem? Like, the modem itself is on, it's just not connecting?

Customer: Right. It's definitely on. I can see the power light is, uh... it's green. But that's the only green one. All the other lights are red or yellow or off.

Agent: Got it. (typing sounds) Okay, so, we've tried the restart, we've checked the cables. Let me walk you through a factory reset. This will clear everything on the modem and return it to default settings, so we'll have to reconfigure it after. But it might help diagnose what's going on. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yeah, sure, let's try that.

Agent: Alright. On the back or bottom of your modem, there's a small button—usually recessed, so you might need a paperclip or a pen tip to access it. Can you locate that?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, I can see it. There's a little button that says "Reset" on it.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so with the modem plugged in, I want you to hold that button down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause, then a beeping sound) Okay, I'm holding it... (beeping continues) ...and... I'm letting go.

Agent: Great. Now the modem should start resetting. You're going to see the lights do some... they call it a light show. They'll blink and change colors for a while. This is normal.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm seeing that. Red, orange, yellow... they're all going nuts.

Agent: That's exactly what should happen. This'll take a minute or two. Let's just let it do its thing.

Customer: (background noise, pause) Okay.

Agent: (pause) How are things on your end?

Customer: (pause) Uh... it's still doing the light show. Lots of blinking.

Agent: Yep, that's fine. You might be waiting here for a couple minutes actually. Let me just make sure I have your email address on file so I can send you a follow-up ticket if needed. Your account shows [inaudible]—is that still current?

Customer: Um, let me think. Yeah, I think so. It's j-mitchell-87 at... at Gmail.

Agent: Perfect, got it. Alright... (pause) ...and now?

Customer: (pause) Okay, um... the lights are slowing down now. I think... I think I'm seeing a green light? Yeah, there's definitely green on there now.

Agent: Excellent! So you should be getting closer. The modem needs to reestablish your connection to our network, so just hang tight.

Customer: Okay, this is looking promising. I'm seeing... (pause) ...more green lights, actually. Is that... is that good?

Agent: That's very good, actually. That usually means we're getting close to a full connection. Can you give me one more minute?

Customer: Yeah, no problem. (pause) Okay, um... Derek? I hate to be that guy, but the lights just went back to red again. All of them. Red lights across the board.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay. That's... that's unexpected. Let me think about this for a second. (pause) Alright, the reset didn't quite work the way we hoped. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) 

Customer: Should I try something else, or...?

Agent: No, no, just give me one second. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm checking your modem's status on our system, and... hmm. I'm actually not seeing your modem connecting to our network at all right now. It's like it's not even reaching us.

Customer: Is that bad?

Agent: Well, it could indicate a few things. It could be the modem itself, which sometimes happens—equipment fails. Or it could be something on the line side. Have you looked outside at all? Do you see if the line is connected properly where it comes into your house?

Customer: (pause) Oh, um, not really. It's kind of on the side of the house that's hard to access. Do you think that's...?

Agent: It's possible. Sometimes these cables can loosen from the connection point at the house, or if there's been any recent weather... even though you said you haven't had any storms. It's worth checking if you're able to.

Customer: (pause) Well, okay, let me... let me go look. This might take a second.

Agent: Yeah, no problem. Take your time.

Customer: (sound of movement, door opening, wind noise, sounds of walking) Okay, I'm here. It's... it's kind of dark out here. Let me get closer. (pause) Um... there's definitely a cable here. It looks connected to me, but it's a little dusty so I can't see super clearly. The connection point... it doesn't look loose, but let me try and... (sounds of struggling) ...try and push it in a little bit more to make sure. (sound of something clicking) Okay, I pushed it in.

Agent: Good. Did you feel any give or did it seem pretty snug?

Customer: I mean, it felt pretty snug before, but now I guess it's... it's a little more secure? I'm not sure.

Agent: Alright, well, let's head back inside and we'll see if that changed anything.

Customer: (sound of door closing) Okay, I'm back inside. Let me look at the modem again. (pause) Still all red lights.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Alright, I'm going to be honest with you, James. We've tried the restart, we've tried the factory reset, we've checked the external connections. At this point, I think there might be an issue with the modem itself, or there could be a problem on the line that I'm not able to diagnose remotely.

Customer: So, like... what do we do?

Agent: Well, I have a couple of options for you. We can schedule a technician to come out and check your line and your equipment. That would be the most comprehensive way to figure out what's going on. Or, if you're interested, we can ship you a replacement modem to try, and you could return the current one.

Customer: How long would a technician take? I'm working from home, so I really need the internet back as soon as possible.

Agent: I understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, our earliest availability in your area is... it looks like tomorrow, between 8 AM and 12 PM. Or we have an afternoon window the day after tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM.

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow morning could work, but... I mean, is there any chance this is something simple that I'm missing? Should we try anything else?

Agent: (pause) I mean, we could try a few more things, but honestly, I think we've covered the major troubleshooting steps. At this point, I don't want to have you spinning your wheels when the real issue might need in-person diagnosis, you know?

Customer: Yeah, I guess you're right. (pause) Alright, let's set up the technician for tomorrow morning then.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I have you down for tomorrow, between 8 AM and noon. A technician will come out and assess the issue. They might need to check your line, your connection point, and possibly replace your modem if that's the culprit.

Customer: Okay, and do I need to be there the whole time?

Agent: You'll need to be there to let them in, but once they're inside and working, you can step away if you need to. They'll typically take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on what the issue is.

Customer: Alright, that sounds good. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Should I leave the modem plugged in or anything?

Agent: You can leave it plugged in. It won't hurt anything. Or you can unplug it if you prefer. Either way is fine. Just leave it as is.

Customer: Okay, got it. Well, I appreciate your help, Derek, even though we couldn't get it working.

Agent: I appreciate that, James. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve it over the phone. But the technician tomorrow should be able to get you back up and running. You should have received a confirmation email, and you can also check your account online for the appointment details. If you have any questions before tomorrow, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good evening, and sorry again for the trouble.

Customer: No problem. Bye.

Agent: Bye, James.
