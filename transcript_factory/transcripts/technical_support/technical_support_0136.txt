Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. So, uh, my internet just went out like an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and everything but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account and we'll see what we can do here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account here under... is this Michael Torres?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing a complete outage, is that right? No internet at all?

Customer: Right, nothing. And I need this for work, so this is pretty frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me ask you a few questions first. Are all the lights on your modem lit up, or are some of them off?

Customer: Um... (pause) Let me go look at it. (background noise of walking) Okay, so... I see the power light is on, that's green. But the internet light is... it's off, I think. Or it's red? It's definitely not green like it normally is.

Agent: Okay, so the internet light is red or off. That's helpful information. And do you have a router as well, or just the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I have a router too. It's also on, but... uh... (pause) the light on that one is off as well, I think. Actually, it might be blinking? I'm not great with this stuff.

Agent: No worries, that's what I'm here for. So the router light is blinking. That actually suggests it's trying to connect but not getting a signal from the modem. Let's try some basic troubleshooting. Can you unplug the modem for me?

Customer: I already did that earlier.

Agent: Okay, but let's try it one more time. Just to be thorough. Can you unplug it and then wait about thirty seconds?

Customer: (background noise of movement) Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we wait, I'm also checking our system here to see if there are any outages in your area... (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm not seeing any widespread outages on our end.

Customer: So it's just my house?

Agent: It's looking that way. Do you have a battery backup unit on your modem? Sometimes those can cause issues if they're—

Customer: I'm not sure what that is.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Is there any kind of box or device between the modem and the wall where the cable comes in?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't think so. Just the modem plugged into the wall outlet.

Agent: Got it. So after you count to thirty, go ahead and plug it back in. And then wait about two minutes for it to fully boot back up.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (background noise) Thirty seconds should be... about now. (pause) (sound of plugging in) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now, we're gonna give it a couple minutes to power up completely. While we wait, can you tell me—have you had any storms in your area recently?

Customer: Um, not really. It was kind of cloudy this morning but nothing major.

Agent: Okay, just checking. Sometimes weather can affect the lines. (pause) So we're at about a minute now. Do you see any lights coming back on the modem?

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah. The power light is back on. And I see... (pause) ...is that the internet light starting to come back?

Agent: Good! That's a positive sign. Keep watching. It should go solid green in the next thirty seconds or so.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... it's still kind of amber or yellow... but it's on now.

Agent: Amber or yellow, that's... hmm. It should be solid green. Let me ask you something—when you look at your computer or phone, are you getting any internet connection at all? Are any devices picking up the WiFi?

Customer: Oh, let me check. (pause) I'm looking at my phone... (pause) I'm not seeing our WiFi network showing up.

Agent: You're not seeing the WiFi network? That's... okay. Can you walk over to the modem one more time and look at all the lights for me? Just describe what you see.

Customer: (background noise of walking) Okay, so... power is green, that's fine. The internet light is... it's yellow. And then there's another light that looks like it might be... blinking? It's kind of hard to see.

Agent: The blinking light—where's that one positioned? Is it at the top, bottom...?

Customer: It's on the right side. There's like... four lights total.

Agent: Okay, so you've got power, internet is yellow, and there's a blinking light on the right side. (pause) The blinking light might be the phone line or the TV connection. The fact that the internet light is yellow instead of green is concerning. That typically means there's a signal issue. Let me check something on my end real quick. (typing sounds, longer pause)

Customer: Is that bad?

Agent: It could be a few different things. It might be a connection issue with the line coming into your house, or it could be the modem itself. Have you had any work done on your line recently? Any construction or digging near your house?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of. But you know, there were some Frontier trucks in the neighborhood like... I don't know, a week or two ago?

Agent: Okay, well that might not be related, but it's good to know. Um, I'm looking at the signal levels here and... (typing, pause) ...yeah, I'm actually seeing some inconsistencies on our end. The modem isn't registering a consistent signal strength.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It means the modem might not be able to establish a proper connection to our network. Let me try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? That's—

Customer: Wait, won't that erase everything?

Agent: No, it'll reset the modem to factory settings but it shouldn't affect anything on your computer. Your internet credentials are stored on our end, so once it resets, it should automatically reconnect. Do you want to try that?

Customer: I mean... if you think it'll help?

Agent: It's worth a shot. So look for a small button on the modem—usually recessed—that says "Reset." You'll need to use a paperclip or pen to press it. Hold it for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. (sound of button press) How long do I hold it?

Agent: About ten seconds, so... one Mississippi, two Mississippi... (counting fades into background as customer counts)

Customer: (pause) Is that it? It's restarting now.

Agent: Great. Give it another couple minutes to boot up. (longer pause) 

Agent: Okay, still with me?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here. Looking at the modem now... (pause) Okay, so the lights are coming back but... (pause) it's the same thing. Power is green, internet is yellow again.

Agent: Yellow again. (pause, typing sounds) Yeah, so the reset didn't resolve it. That tells me this is likely a signal issue on the line side rather than the modem itself. Michael, I hate to say this, but I think we're gonna need to send a technician out to your location to check the physical line and the connection point.

Customer: (frustrated) A technician? How long is that gonna take?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so our next available appointment would be... (typing, pause) ...tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have Thursday afternoon.

Customer: That's not ideal. I work from home and I really need the internet today.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry we can't resolve this over the phone. Unfortunately, without a technician being able to physically inspect the line, there's not much more I can troubleshoot. It could be anything from a loose connection at the junction box to damage on the exterior line.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, yeah, I guess I'll have to take the tomorrow morning slot then.

Agent: I can absolutely set that up for you. Just so you know, there's a $99 service call fee if this ends up being a problem on your end rather than Frontier's infrastructure. But if it's our line, there's no charge.

Customer: Of course there's a fee. (pause) Yeah, okay, go ahead and schedule it.

Agent: Perfect. So that's tomorrow, Tuesday, January 14th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. Your confirmation number is 447829. We'll also send you a text message with the appointment details. Do you have the phone number on file?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Great. I've also added a note to your account about what we've troubleshot, so the technician will have that information when they arrive. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Hopefully they can figure it out tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident they will. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We appreciate your patience, and thank you for choosing Frontier Communications.

Customer: Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Have a good day, Michael.
