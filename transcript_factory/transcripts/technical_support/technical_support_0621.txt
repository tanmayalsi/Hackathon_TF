Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just completely went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll get this figured out for you. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got you here. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Has anything happened recently? Like a storm, power outage, or any changes to your equipment?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine. I was just browsing and suddenly everything froze and then... nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Got it. And you've already tried unplugging your equipment. When you did that, how long did you leave it unplugged?

Customer: Maybe... thirty seconds? Should I have left it longer?

Agent: Yeah, actually, let's try that again. Why don't you unplug your modem and router, and then wait about two to three minutes before plugging them back in?

Customer: Okay, give me a second. (pause) (background noise of unplugging) Alright, they're unplugged.

Agent: Great. And while we're waiting, can you tell me—do you see any lights on the modem or router right now?

Customer: No, nothing. They're dark.

Agent: Perfect. That's what we want. Let's give it a couple minutes. Go ahead and set a timer on your phone if you want.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm timing it. Two minutes, right?

Agent: Two to three, yeah. So while we wait, I'm also going to check our system here to see if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) What's your service address, Michael?

Customer: It's 247 Maple Street, apartment 3B, in Portland.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, checking that now... Alright, I'm not showing any active outages in your area, so that's good news.

Customer: Okay... (pause) So it should come back on then?

Agent: Well, we'll see. The restart usually clears out any temporary glitches. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (background noise) Alright, it's plugged in. I see a light now... it's blinking.

Agent: Good, that's normal. That means it's booting up. Now go ahead and plug in the router as well.

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Done.

Agent: Okay, and now we just need to give it about a minute or so to fully start up. While it's doing that, can you tell me—when you say the internet went out, could you see the WiFi network on your devices, or was it completely gone?

Customer: Completely gone. I checked my phone and there was nothing. No signal, no network.

Agent: Alright. So... (pause) Do you see lights on the router now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it. I see... the power light is solid green now. And there's a couple other lights that are starting to blink.

Agent: Excellent. That's a good sign. Go ahead and try connecting one of your devices to the WiFi. Do you have a phone or computer nearby?

Customer: I've got my laptop right here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking for the network... I see it... trying to connect...

Agent: Great. And...?

Customer: (longer pause) Hmm. It's still trying to connect. It says "connecting..." but it's been like... twenty seconds already. Usually it's faster than that.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let's give it another moment. Sometimes the first connection after a restart takes a bit longer.

Customer: (pause) Still connecting... (pause) Okay, no, this isn't working. It keeps saying "can't connect to this network." What's happening?

Agent: Alright, let me check a few things on our end. (typing sounds) I'm pulling up your modem's status. (pause) Hmm... I'm seeing that your modem is registering on our network, so that's... that's actually good. But your router might be the issue.

Customer: Okay, so what does that mean? Is my router broken?

Agent: Not necessarily. Let me have you try something. Can you restart the router separately? Go ahead and unplug just the router—leave the modem plugged in this time.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Leave it unplugged for about forty-five seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright... (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (background noise)

Customer: (pause) I see the power light coming back on. Lights are blinking.

Agent: Good. And now try connecting your laptop again to the WiFi.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking for it... there's the network... connecting... (longer pause) Come on... (pause) No, still nothing. It's saying the password might be wrong, but I know the password is correct. I literally just used it yesterday.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, try one more time. And when you enter the password, make sure you're being careful with capitalization. Sometimes that's the issue.

Customer: (typing sounds) (pause) No, same thing. It's not accepting it. This is really frustrating.

Agent: (pause) I understand. Let me try a few other things. I'm going to check... (typing sounds) Can you tell me the model number on your router? It should be on the back or bottom of the device.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, looking at the back... It says "Model WR-6841X."

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up... Alright, your router is showing up in our system as registered. (pause) You know what, Michael, I want to try a factory reset on the router. This might resolve the issue.

Customer: A factory reset? Will I lose anything?

Agent: It will reset your WiFi settings, so you'll just need to reconnect your devices. But nothing on your computer or personal files will be affected.

Customer: (pause) Okay, fine. How do I do that?

Agent: There should be a small button on the back of the router. It might be recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something similar to press it.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I see it. There's a little button that says "reset."

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and hold that button down for about ten to fifteen seconds while the router is powered on.

Customer: (background noise of pressing) (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... and... (pause) The lights are going crazy now. Is that normal?

Agent: Yes, that's normal. You should see them all blink and then restart. Just let it sit for another minute.

Customer: (pause) (pause) Okay, they've calmed down. Now what?

Agent: Now try connecting to the WiFi again. You should see your network, but this time you might see two networks appear—one for 2.4 gigahertz and one for 5 gigahertz. Try the 5G one first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see them now. There's two networks showing up. Connecting to the 5G one... (pause) Asking for a password again...

Agent: Yeah, you'll need to set up the WiFi from scratch. The default password should be on a sticker on the router itself.

Customer: (background noise) Let me look... (pause) Okay, I found it. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, entering the password... (longer pause) Still connecting... come on... (pause) No. No, same issue. It's not connecting.

Agent: (pause) Okay, um... let me put you on a brief hold while I check with my supervisor about this. I want to make sure we're not missing something. Is that okay?

Customer: Sure, yeah.

Agent: (hold music plays for approximately 30 seconds)

Agent: Okay, Michael, I'm back. So we've tried several troubleshooting steps and the router isn't responding as it should. At this point, I think the issue might be with the router itself, or there could be something more complex going on with your modem that's not showing up in our system.

Customer: So what are you saying?

Agent: What I'd like to do is escalate this to our technical team and get a technician out to your place to take a look in person. They'll be able to run more in-depth diagnostics and potentially replace equipment if needed.

Customer: How long is that going to take? I need my internet.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) The earliest I can get someone out there would be tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... that's the best you can do?

Agent: I know it's not ideal. We do have an expedited option, but that would incur a thirty-five dollar rush fee. If you'd prefer, I can put in a standard appointment for tomorrow at no charge.

Customer: (pause) Can't you just send someone today?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, all our technicians are booked solid for today. If it's urgent, I can add that rush fee and try to get someone within the next few hours, but I can't guarantee a specific time window.

Customer: (sigh) Just... just make the appointment for tomorrow. What time should I expect them?

Agent: Alright, I'm putting that in the system now. (typing sounds) So we have you down for tomorrow, and the window is 8 AM to 5 PM. A technician will come by and they'll assess what's going on. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Michael?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. So I just... I don't have internet until tomorrow?

Agent: I'm afraid so. I'm really sorry we weren't able to resolve this remotely. But our technician tomorrow should be able to get you back up and running.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate you trying anyway, Derek.

Agent: Of course. And just so you have it, your appointment confirmation number is 4479521. You should receive a text and an email about it shortly. And if you need anything before the technician arrives, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. We appreciate your business with Frontier, and sorry for the inconvenience today.

Customer: Yeah, no problem. Bye.

Agent: Take care.
