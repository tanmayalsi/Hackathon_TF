# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went out completely and I don't know what's going on. I've been without connection for like two hours now and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account and we'll see what we can do. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's, uh... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And can I get your name?

Customer: It's James. James Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. Okay, so you're in the Tucson area, and you've got our Fiber 500 package. And you're saying the internet went out about two hours ago?

Customer: Yeah, around 1 o'clock this afternoon. One minute it was working fine and then, just... nothing. The router's still on, it's got all the lights on it, but my computer isn't picking up anything.

Agent: Okay. Well, the first thing I want to check is if there's any outage in your area. (pause) Let me look at that... (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end, so that's a good sign. Let's try some basic troubleshooting. Have you tried unplugging the modem and the router and plugging them back in?

Customer: No, I haven't done that yet. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, why don't we give that a shot. Go ahead and unplug the modem first—that's the box that connects to the wall outlet—and just wait about thirty seconds.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, so I'm looking at the setup here. I've got the modem, which is the white box, right?

Agent: Yes, that's right. The white box with the Frontier logo on it.

Customer: Yeah, okay. (background noise) I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. And just to be clear, we're counting to thirty, so just give it half a minute or so.

Customer: (pause) Okay... thirty seconds. I'm plugging it back in now. (pause) And it's... starting back up. I see the lights coming on.

Agent: Good. Good. Now let's do the same with the router. That's the gray box, usually a little bit bigger.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, I got it. Unplugging now. (pause) Okay, waiting. (pause) And... back in.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give those about two minutes to fully boot back up and reinitialize their connection. While we're waiting, have you noticed anything else unusual? Any power outages or storms in your area recently?

Customer: No, no storms or anything like that. It's been totally clear all day. I really don't know what happened.

Agent: Okay. And you said all the lights on the router are on, correct?

Customer: Yeah, they're all lit up. I see like... four or five different lights and they're all green.

Agent: Excellent. That's actually a good sign. If they were all red, that would indicate a bigger issue. (pause) Okay, James, it's been about two minutes now. Why don't you try opening up a website on your computer or your phone and see if you're getting internet connection now?

Customer: (pause) (typing sounds) Let me try... (pause) No, still nothing. I'm not seeing any connection available. It's not even showing up as an available network anymore.

Agent: Okay, hmm. Let's try a different approach. Can you tell me what you see on the front of the modem right now? Are there any lights that are red or orange, or are they all lit up normally?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, so I'm looking at it. I see... I see one red light. There's like a power light that's green, and then there's another one that's red. It's blinking red.

Agent: Okay, which light is blinking red? Is it labeled at all?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it says "Internet" on it. The Internet light is blinking red.

Agent: That's helpful, thank you. So a blinking red Internet light typically means the modem is trying to connect to our network but it's not succeeding. Let's check the physical connection. Can you go ahead and locate the cable that's plugged into the modem? It should be coming from your wall.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm... yeah, I see it. There's a cable going from the wall outlet to the back of the modem.

Agent: Perfect. Can you just give that a gentle tug to make sure it's fully seated and connected?

Customer: (background noise) It feels pretty secure... yeah, it's in there pretty good.

Agent: Okay. And on the other end, where it plugs into the wall—

Customer: —I'm checking it now. (pause) Yeah, that one's tight too.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Let me try restarting the modem on my end. This might take a minute. What I'm doing is sending a remote restart signal to your modem, so you might see the lights flicker or go out temporarily. That's totally normal.

Customer: Okay, I'm watching it now.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I've sent that through. Give it about another minute to reconnect to the network.

Customer: (pause) Still red. Still blinking.

Agent: Still blinking red?

Customer: Yeah. Same as before.

Agent: Okay. Let me ask you a couple more questions. Is there any chance that the coaxial cable—that's the cable coming from the wall—could have been damaged? Have you moved anything recently, or has there been any physical disturbance near those cables?

Customer: No, not that I know of. Everything's been pretty much the same as always. I mean, my kid was playing around back there yesterday, but... I don't think he touched anything. The cables seem fine from what I can see.

Agent: Okay. Well, here's what I want to try next. Can you locate the reset button on the modem itself? It's usually a small pinhole button on the back.

Customer: (background noise) (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's like a tiny little hole with "Reset" next to it.

Agent: That's the one. Now, I want to warn you—pressing this is going to completely wipe the modem settings and you'll basically be starting from scratch. But let's give it a try. Go ahead and press and hold that button for about ten seconds.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, holding it down. (pause) (pause) Okay, releasing. (pause) The lights are going crazy now. They're all flashing.

Agent: Yes, that's expected. The modem is reinitializing. This might take three to five minutes, so just let it sit and stabilize.

Customer: (pause) Okay, we're waiting.

Agent: (pause) While we wait, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) (pause) [inaudible] ...yeah. (pause) Okay, James? I'm not seeing any issues with your line from our equipment side. So it does seem like this might be a modem issue or a physical line problem.

Customer: (pause) Uh-huh. So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could mean that either the modem itself has gone bad, or there's an issue with the line coming into your house. (pause) How long have you had that modem?

Customer: (pause) Honestly, I don't know. A couple years? I got it when I signed up for Frontier.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Have you had any issues with it before this?

Customer: No, not really. It's been pretty solid until today.

Agent: Right. (pause) Okay, let me check the status of the modem one more time. (pause) (typing sounds) (pause) Nope, still showing a line connection issue on our end. (pause) Okay, James, I've been monitoring your modem, and unfortunately, it's still unable to establish a connection to our network. At this point, we have a couple options. One is we can schedule a technician to come out to your home and check both the modem and the line coming in. Or, if you want, we can send you a replacement modem to see if that resolves the issue.

Customer: How long would it take for the technician to come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest I'm seeing is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow morning? Yeah, I guess that'll work. But I really need this working today if possible.

Agent: I completely understand. I wish I had something sooner available. Unfortunately, our technicians are pretty booked up this afternoon. But what I can do is have them bring a replacement modem as well, just in case that's the issue. And they'll check all your connections and diagnose what's going on.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. And just to make sure we have the right contact information, is 555-0147 still the best number to reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell phone. I'll have it with me.

Agent: Great. So we have you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. A technician will be coming out to check your line and your modem. They'll have a replacement modem with them if we need it. You should receive a confirmation text on that number. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that's it. I'm just frustrated that it happened, you know?

Agent: I totally understand, and I'm sorry you're experiencing this. Our technicians are great, and I'm confident they'll get you back up and running. We really appreciate your patience today, James.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye.
