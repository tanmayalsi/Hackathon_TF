Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out this morning and I can't get it back up. I've been without service for like two hours now and I really need to get this working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. Okay, so your internet went down this morning around... (pause) ...looks like around 10 AM based on our system. Is that about right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. I was just sitting here working from home and everything just... stopped.

Agent: Alright, well let's walk through some troubleshooting steps to see if we can get you back online. First thing—do you have a modem and router combo unit, or are those separate devices?

Customer: Um, I think they're separate? I have like a white box and then a black box next to it.

Agent: Okay, so that sounds like they're separate units. The white one should be your modem—that's the one that connects to the wall—and the black one is your router. When you look at them right now, what lights do you see on the modem?

Customer: (pause) The modem... let me look. I see a light that's... it's kind of orange or red? And then there's one that's just off.

Agent: Okay, so if it's solid orange or red, that typically indicates a connection issue. Have you tried unplugging it yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, let's try that. Go ahead and unplug the modem from the power outlet for about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: (background noise of movement) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just give it about 30 seconds...

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) The lights are... they're coming back on. There's a blue light now, and... (pause) ...and like a white one.

Agent: Perfect, that's what we want to see. The blue light means it's connecting. Give it about a minute or so to fully boot up, and then we should see some activity lights. While that's cycling, let me ask you a couple questions. Have you had any weather issues recently? Any storms or anything like that?

Customer: No, it's actually been pretty nice today. Clear skies and all that.

Agent: Okay, good. And have there been any recent construction or work done on your property? Anyone digging in your yard?

Customer: Not that I know of. No, I don't think so.

Agent: Alright. So how are those lights looking now? Do you see any blinking lights or activity?

Customer: (pause) Um, the blue light is still on but I don't see... it's not blinking or anything. It's just solid. And the white one is solid too.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) (pause) So I'm not seeing any active connection coming from your modem on our network right now. Let me ask you—when you look at the modem, are there any lights that say "online" or have any text next to them?

Customer: (pause) There's... yeah, there's writing. It says "power" under one of them, and then... "internet" under the other one. The internet one is dark.

Agent: Ah, okay. That's the issue right there. Your internet light is offline. So the modem's powered up, but it's not getting a signal from our network. Let me check if there's an outage in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) No, I'm not seeing any outages reported. Let me try resetting the modem remotely.

Customer: Okay, you can do that from there?

Agent: Yeah, I can send a command to restart the modem. Give me just one second... (typing sounds) Alright, I've sent that command. The modem should be restarting now. You might see the lights flicker or go dark for a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay, they just went dark.

Agent: Yep, that's normal. Let's give it another minute to boot back up and reestablish the connection.

Customer: (pause) The power light's back on. Internet light is... still dark though.

Agent: Still dark, okay. (pause) Alright, I'm still not seeing a connection on our end. Have you checked the cable that runs from the wall to your modem? Is it plugged in securely?

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) Let me look. Yeah, it's plugged in. It looks pretty secure to me.

Agent: Can you try unplugging it and plugging it back in? Sometimes these connections can get a little loose.

Customer: Sure. (background noise) Unplugging... (pause) ...and back in. (pause) Still nothing.

Agent: Okay. (typing sounds) You know what, I'm going to check one more thing here. Let me see if we can determine if this is an issue on our network infrastructure side or something with the device itself. Can you check—is there a reset button on the back of the modem?

Customer: A reset button? I mean, probably? I'd have to look back there. There's a lot of cables...

Agent: Yeah, take a look. It's usually a small button, sometimes recessed, might say "reset" next to it.

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Okay, I'm looking... I see a button that's kind of small, yeah. It says "reset" next to it.

Agent: Alright, so I'm going to have you hold that button for about 10 seconds. This is going to completely reset the modem to factory settings, so it's a last resort troubleshooting step. Are you ready?

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) Holding it... (pause) ...how long?

Agent: About 10 seconds. That should do it. Go ahead and let it go.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let it go. It's restarting again.

Agent: Alright, give it a minute and a half or so to fully reboot. Sometimes it takes a little longer after a factory reset.

Customer: (long pause) The lights are back on. Power light is blue, and... the internet light is still off. This is not looking good, is it?

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I'm... I'm not seeing any connection from our end either. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm going to be honest with you, at this point it seems like there might be an issue either with the modem itself or potentially with the line coming into your home. The troubleshooting steps we've done should have worked if it was just a temporary connection issue.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, what do I do?

Agent: Well, I have a couple options for you. I can set up a technician visit to come out and take a look at both the equipment and the line. They'd be able to pinpoint exactly what's going on. The earliest I can get someone out there would be... (typing sounds) ...tomorrow between 2 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I... I really need this working today. I'm supposed to be working from home. Is there anything else we can try right now?

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately, we've gone through all the remote troubleshooting I can do. If there's a hardware failure or a line issue, those require an in-person visit. But let me... let me see if there's anything else. (pause) (typing sounds) You know, one more thing we could try—sometimes there's a firmware issue. Did you receive any notifications recently about modem updates?

Customer: I don't... I don't think so? I mean, I might have missed it. What would that look like?

Agent: It would usually be an email from us. (pause) Actually, let me check if there's a pending update on the modem's settings page. Do you have access to a computer right now?

Customer: Yeah, I have my laptop.

Agent: Okay, so you should be able to connect to your router wirelessly, even if the internet isn't working. That's a separate thing. You should see the WiFi network name...

Customer: Wait, if I can connect to the router, does that mean the internet might actually be working?

Agent: No, it won't give you actual internet access. The WiFi would just... it would connect you to the router, but there'd be no data going through it. It's just so we can access the modem's settings. (pause) Actually, you know what, at this point I think that's going to be more complicated than it's worth. I think we need to get a tech out there.

Customer: (sighs) Okay. So tomorrow between 2 and 4?

Agent: Yeah, that's the earliest availability. I apologize that I can't get this working for you today. I know that's frustrating. Let me just confirm everything. You're at... (typing sounds) ...123 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: And 555-0847?

Customer: Correct.

Agent: Great. So I'm getting you scheduled for tomorrow, Thursday, between 2 and 4 PM. The technician will be able to diagnose the issue and hopefully get you back online. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I just... hopefully it gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I really do apologize. We'll get this sorted out for you. If you have any other issues before then or if you need to reschedule, just give us a call back. The number is on your bill.

Customer: Okay. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this today.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye.
