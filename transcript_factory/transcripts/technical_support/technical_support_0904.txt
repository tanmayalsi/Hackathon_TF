# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Marcus. So my internet just went down about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got work stuff I need to do and I'm kind of freaking out here.

Agent: I completely understand. That's frustrating, especially when you need it for work. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one second... got it. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. Before we dive into troubleshooting, have you noticed any outages in your area, or did it just stop working all of a sudden?

Customer: No, I didn't see anything online about an outage. It was just... I was working and then the video call I was on just froze and then everything went down. I tried restarting my computer but that didn't help.

Agent: Okay, so let's start with the basics. Can you go over to your router right now? It should be the Frontier-branded box, usually white or black.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's on the shelf by my desk.

Agent: Perfect. Take a look at the lights on the front of the router. What color are they and are they blinking or solid?

Customer: Um... there's a red light on the front. Just one red light.

Agent: Okay, a red light typically indicates a connection issue. We're going to try a couple of things. First, I want you to unplug the router from the power source. Just pull it right out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, done.

Agent: Great. Now go ahead and unplug the modem as well if you have a separate modem. It'll be a smaller box, probably has more lights on it.

Customer: Oh, there's one here too. (unplugging sounds) Alright, both unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about 30 seconds while those power down completely. I'll wait with you.

Customer: (background noise, waiting) Okay, I'm counting down...

Agent: (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug the modem back in first. That's the smaller one.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Done. So now I just wait?

Agent: Yeah, give that about a minute to fully boot up. You'll see the lights start to cycle through. Once they stabilize, we'll plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, the lights are... I mean, they're doing different things now. Some are blinking, some are solid. Is that normal?

Agent: Yeah, that's normal during startup. That should only last about 30 to 60 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, they're... they look more stable now. I see green and white lights now.

Agent: Excellent. Now go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Plugging it in now.

Agent: Great. Give that another minute or so to boot up and get fully connected.

Customer: (pause) Alright, and... still have that red light on the front.

Agent: Hmm. That's strange. Let me check your account here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages reported on your line. The account looks active and good on my end. Can you tell me... is there anything physically different? Like, did you see any technicians in the area, or do you remember if anything changed with your setup recently?

Customer: No, nothing that I can think of. I mean, I didn't touch anything. This was just sudden.

Agent: Okay, let's try one more thing. Can you look at the back of the modem? There should be a small reset button, usually recessed into the device.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. Like a tiny hole with a button inside?

Agent: That's the one. What we're going to do is hold a paperclip or something thin in there for about 10 seconds while the modem is plugged in. This will factory reset it, but it should help us clear out any configuration issues.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I got a paperclip. Holding it in... (pause) ...still holding... (pause) Okay, I'm at about 10 seconds.

Agent: Perfect. You can release it now.

Customer: (pause) Alright, released. Now what?

Agent: Now the modem is going to restart itself. It might take a couple minutes to come back online. You'll see the lights cycle again.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the lights are doing their thing again. I've got blinking, green, white... (pause, longer) Okay, now they're settling down again. But that red light on the router... it's still red.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Okay, I'm going to be honest with you here. The fact that the modem is coming back online correctly but the router is still showing that red light... that suggests there might be a hardware issue with the router itself. Have you tried moving the cable that goes from the modem to the router? Sometimes those connections can get loose.

Customer: I can try that. (pause) Okay, I'm unplugging it from the modem end... let me wiggle it around a bit... (pause) ...and plugging it back in.

Agent: Good. Any change?

Customer: (pause) No. Still red.

Agent: Alright, let me see what we can do here. One more thing we can try is a full power cycle of everything together. Let me have you unplug both the modem and the router, and this time wait for a full two minutes before plugging anything back in.

Customer: Two minutes? Okay... (unplugging sounds) Both are unplugged now. I'm setting a timer.

Agent: (pause) Perfect. I'm going to pull up some notes here while we wait. (typing sounds)

Customer: (waiting) So like... what do you think is happening? Is it the modem or the router?

Agent: Based on what we're seeing, it's most likely the router. The modem is responding correctly—it's coming back online, getting a signal. But the router isn't establishing that connection with the modem. Those are usually pretty reliable, but hardware can fail sometimes.

Customer: (pause) That's not great. Do I need to replace it?

Agent: Well, let's finish this power cycle first and see if that resolves it. If not, we may need to get you a replacement unit or potentially have a tech come out to take a look. We should be able to handle that, but let's try this first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, time's up.

Agent: Go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Plugged in.

Agent: (pause) And while that's starting up, I'm going to look at getting a replacement router shipped to you as a backup plan, just in case.

Customer: (pause) Good idea. Actually, wait—the lights are different this time. I'm seeing... green lights, I think all green actually.

Agent: That's a good sign. That means the modem is connecting. Now go ahead and plug the router in.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Okay, plugging it in.

Customer: (longer pause) Alright, so it's starting up but... (pause) ...still showing red again. Come on, man.

Agent: I hear the frustration. (pause) Unfortunately, that's indicating the same issue. I think we're looking at a router hardware failure here. Let me get you set up with a replacement unit. What I'll do is ship one out to you today, and in the meantime, we may also be able to send a technician out, or you could swap it out yourself once the new one arrives. Which would you prefer?

Customer: How long does shipping take?

Agent: For Fiber customers in your area, we typically do 2-3 business days for standard shipping. We do have expedited options that can get it to you tomorrow, but there would be a small fee for that.

Customer: (pause) Can I just... can I get a tech to come out today? I really need the internet back up today if possible.

Agent: Let me check the availability for today. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm showing our next available appointment window is actually today, between 4 and 6 PM. That's in about... well, it depends on what time it is for you now, but would that work?

Customer: What time is it... it's 2:30 right now. Yeah, 4 to 6 PM works. I can be here.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule that for you. The technician will bring a replacement router and can get you back online today. Can I confirm your service address?

Customer: It's 447 Maple Drive, apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. 447 Maple Drive, apartment 3B. So to confirm—technician visit today, 4 to 6 PM window, for a router replacement due to hardware failure. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes with all the details and the technician's phone number.

Customer: Okay, great. I appreciate that. I'm sorry for being grumpy earlier. I just really needed this figured out.

Agent: No, don't apologize at all. I completely understand. That's what I'm here for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll have you back online very shortly. You have a great day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.
