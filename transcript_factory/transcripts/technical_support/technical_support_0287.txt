# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get to the bottom of this. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing an account for... is this David Martinez?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Alright David, so your internet is completely down? Let me ask you a few questions first. Are you able to see any lights on your modem right now?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually... it's, uh... (pause) the modem's got a red light on it. Like, it's not the normal blue or green or whatever.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. A red light usually indicates a connection issue. Let me walk you through a few troubleshooting steps here. First, can you tell me... is the modem plugged in directly to the wall outlet?

Customer: Yeah, it's plugged in. I checked that already.

Agent: Good. And do you have a router separate from the modem, or do you have our all-in-one unit?

Customer: I have the box you guys gave me, so... the all-in-one thing, I guess?

Agent: Perfect, that makes things easier. Okay, here's what I'd like you to do. I'm going to have you unplug the modem for about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. That'll give it a hard reset.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Just give it about thirty seconds while we wait. You can count it out if you'd like.

Customer: (pause) Okay, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Great, go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. Now what I need you to do is wait about two to three minutes for it to fully boot back up. Once it's back up, the lights should cycle through some different colors, and then you should see a solid blue or green light. Do you see that happening?

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, I'm seeing... it's cycling through some colors right now. Green light is on. So that's... that's good, right?

Agent: That's excellent, David. That means the modem is syncing with our network. Let me just... (typing sounds) give it another minute or so to fully stabilize, and then we can test your connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm waiting.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and try opening up a web page or something on one of your devices. Try going to like Google or something simple.

Customer: (pause) [inaudible] ...still nothing. The page won't load. It's just... spinning.

Agent: Hmm, okay. And you're still seeing that green light on the modem?

Customer: Yeah, the green light is still there.

Agent: Alright, let me check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area, so that's good. But let me... (pause) okay, I'm going to have you try unplugging the modem again, but this time leave it unplugged for about two full minutes. Sometimes if there's a configuration issue, a longer reset can help clear it out.

Customer: Two minutes? Wow, okay. (pause) Unplugging it again.

Agent: And while we're waiting on that, let me just ask—have there been any storms or power outages in your area recently? Anything like that?

Customer: Not that I noticed, no. I mean, the power's been fine in my apartment. Everything else is working.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. (pause) Go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Same thing as before—we're going to wait for it to fully boot up and see those lights cycle through.

Customer: (pause) It's doing the light thing again. I see blue now, and... (pause) okay, still blue. Should I try the webpage again?

Agent: Not quite yet. Let's give it a full three minutes this time. I know it's a bit of waiting, but that'll make sure everything is fully synced up.

Customer: (pause) This is really frustrating. I had a work meeting this morning and I couldn't call in because my internet's down.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll get you back online here shortly. (pause) Alright, go ahead and try that webpage again.

Customer: (pause) ...No, still nothing. Same thing. It's just... the page won't load. I'm not getting anything.

Agent: Okay, let me check your modem settings. I'm going to need you to open a web browser and type in the IP address 192.168.0.1. Can you try that?

Customer: Um, sure, let me... (typing sounds) ...okay I'm typing that in. (pause) I don't see anything. It says like, page not available or something.

Agent: (pause) Hmm, alright. That's telling me the modem itself isn't responding. Let me check the line status on my end here. (typing sounds, pause) I'm going to be honest with you, David, I'm not seeing any provisioning on your line right now. That's a bit unusual.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: It means that the modem isn't registering with our network. Now, this could be a few things. It could be an issue with the line itself, or there could be an equipment issue with the modem. When did you last have service working normally?

Customer: Yesterday evening, everything was fine. I was streaming and everything. Woke up this morning and just... nothing.

Agent: Okay. And you haven't made any changes to anything or had anyone work on the line?

Customer: No, nothing like that.

Agent: Alright. Let me try a few more things here. Can you check the cable connections on the back of the modem? There should be a coaxial cable coming in from the wall. Can you make sure that's nice and tight?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it. It looks pretty tight to me. Like, I don't... I can't really wiggle it much.

Agent: Okay, sometimes even if it looks tight, giving it a small turn clockwise can help. Go ahead and try that.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm turning it. (pause) I don't really see any difference.

Agent: Okay, that's alright. (pause) David, I've tried a few standard troubleshooting steps here, and typically that would resolve the issue. The fact that the modem isn't provisioning on my end, combined with the fact that it won't connect even after multiple resets, is pointing me toward either a line issue or a defective modem unit. I think what we need to do here is either get you a replacement modem, or have a technician come out and check the line.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet back. I have work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) I'm seeing we have some same-day appointments available, but they're showing between 4 and 8 PM today. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, I guess that would... I guess that has to work.

Agent: Great. What I'll do is schedule a technician visit for you today in that window. They'll come out and they can either repair the line or bring you a replacement modem, depending on what they find. In the meantime, is there anything else I can try?

Customer: I don't know, can you try... I mean, isn't there anything you can do from your end?

Agent: (pause) That's a great question. Unfortunately, I'm not able to force a re-provisioning from my system on a modem that's not responding. The technician will have tools that I don't have access to, so they'll be able to diagnose exactly what's going on much better than I can over the phone.

Customer: Alright, I guess... I guess that's the best we can do then.

Agent: I know it's not ideal, but the technician should be able to get you sorted out today. Let me go ahead and get that appointment set up for you. Can I get a callback number for you?

Customer: It's 555-0147. Same as the account number.

Agent: Perfect, I've got that. So David, I'm scheduling you for today, and the technician will arrive sometime between 4 and 8 PM. You should receive a confirmation text message within the next few minutes. Is there a cell phone number that's different from the landline, or is that okay?

Customer: Yeah, just text me on my cell. It's 555-9284.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got that down. So to recap—we've troubleshot the modem, ruled out any area outages, and determined that there's likely either a line or equipment issue that needs an in-person inspection. The technician will be out to you today between 4 and 8 PM. You'll get a text confirmation shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's... I mean, I hope they can fix it today. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize you're dealing with this. Our technician is really good, and I'm confident they'll get you back online today. You're all set, David. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you this evening.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: Have a great day.
