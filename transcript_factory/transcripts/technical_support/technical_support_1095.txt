# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, um, yeah. Hi Derek. So my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the router and everything, but nothing's working.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: (pause) Alright Michael, I've got your account pulled up here. I see you've got our Fiber 500 service. When you say the internet went out, what exactly are you seeing? Are the lights on the modem doing anything?

Customer: Um, okay, so like, there's no lights at all. It's completely dark. The modem's not showing anything.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the modem's powered on, right? You can see that it's getting power?

Customer: Oh wait, hold on. Let me... yeah, I see the power cable is actually plugged in, but now that I look closer... I don't think it's getting any power at all. Like, the outlet might be... let me check the outlet.

Agent: (background noise of customer moving around) Take your time.

Customer: Yeah, so I plugged my phone charger in and that works fine, so the outlet's got power. But this modem... I don't know. It's not turning on.

Agent: Okay, so we know the outlet's good. Can you try using a different power cable if you have one available?

Customer: Uh... (pause) I mean, I could try my laptop charger but wouldn't that be like a different voltage or something?

Agent: Yeah, actually that's a good instinct. Let's not risk that. What I'd like to do is have you unplug the modem completely. Count to about thirty, and then plug it back in.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) ...fifteen... thirty. Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: And what are you seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. It's... it's still completely dark.

Agent: Alright. And you mentioned you tried that already about an hour ago, right? When you first noticed the outage?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I unplugged it but I'm not sure if I waited that long the first time. This time nothing's changed though.

Agent: Okay. Um, let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your service, and I'm not showing any outages in your area, so that's... that's good news potentially. The issue might just be with the modem itself.

Customer: So like... is it broken? Can you replace it?

Agent: Well, let's do a couple more things first before we determine that. Can you check the power cable itself? See if maybe it's damaged anywhere, or if the connection is loose at the modem end?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it. The connection looks... I mean, it seems pretty snug at the outlet end. At the modem end it's... (pause) yeah, it's plugged in pretty tight. I don't see anything wrong with the cable.

Agent: Is there any visible damage to the cable? Any fraying or burn marks or anything like that?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't... no, it looks fine.

Agent: Okay. And, uh, the modem's been in the same location this whole time?

Customer: Yeah, it's been sitting on the shelf in my living room. Why, does it matter?

Agent: Not really, I'm just trying to think through everything. Okay, so here's what I want to try. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem from here. Now, this won't wipe anything, but it might help. Give me just one second.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, I've sent that through. Can you keep an eye on the modem and let me know if anything happens?

Customer: (pause, longer pause) Nothing. Still dark.

Agent: Still nothing, okay. Um... (pause) Michael, I have to be honest with you, it's looking like there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself. When we can't get any power lights or any response at all, that usually means...

Customer: So it's definitely broken?

Agent: Well, it's looking that way, but before we go down that road, I want to try one more thing. Do you have another device you could plug into that same outlet? Just to make absolutely sure the outlet's still working?

Customer: Yeah, yeah. Let me unplug the modem and... okay, I'm plugging in my lamp. (pause) The lamp works fine. So the outlet's good.

Agent: Okay good. So we can rule that out. And then when you plug the modem back in...

Customer: Right, so I'm plugging it back in now... (pause) and it's still not doing anything.

Agent: Yeah, okay. (pause) Michael, I think what we're looking at here is a modem failure. Unfortunately, I'm not able to troubleshoot past this point because there's no response from the device at all.

Customer: So what do I do? I need internet for work and stuff.

Agent: I completely understand. So what we can do is we can schedule a technician to come out and either repair or replace the modem. Do you have availability tomorrow or... are you more of a next-day type of situation?

Customer: Tomorrow would be better if possible.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (pause, typing sounds) What time works best for you? We have a morning window between eight and noon, or an afternoon between one and five.

Customer: Morning would be better.

Agent: Great, so I can get a technician scheduled for tomorrow morning between eight AM and noon. They'll bring a modem and get you back up and running. The service call is covered under your warranty.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that works. Do I need to do anything?

Agent: Just make sure you're home, and if you could have the old modem accessible so the tech can check it out, that would be helpful. We'll text you a confirmation with all the details and they might call fifteen minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Alright, sounds good.

Agent: (pause) I do apologize we weren't able to get it working today, but I have a good feeling we'll have you back online tomorrow.

Customer: No, I appreciate you trying. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. Your confirmation number for the service call is 847392. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see you tomorrow. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
