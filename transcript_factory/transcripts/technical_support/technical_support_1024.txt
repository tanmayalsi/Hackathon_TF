Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of. I'm working from home today and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. And just to confirm, this is for the service at 423 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So your internet just went out about an hour ago. Have you tried doing a power cycle on your modem and router yet?

Customer: Yeah, I unplugged everything for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, good. That's a solid first step. Um, so when you say nothing, do you mean the modem isn't lighting up at all, or is it just not connecting to the internet?

Customer: Well, the modem has lights on it, but they're... I mean, they're not the normal lights that I usually see. Normally there's like a blue light that stays on, but right now it's just like a red light that keeps blinking.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing a red blinking light. That typically indicates there's a connection issue between your modem and our network. Um, let me check something here. (typing sounds) Have you had any weather in your area recently? Any storms or anything like that?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear today. Why, does that matter?

Agent: It can, yeah. Sometimes lightning can affect the connection points in the neighborhood, but in this case it sounds like we're good there. Uh, have you noticed any loose cables on the back of your modem? The coaxial cable especially?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... No, everything looks pretty tight back there. The cables all seem fine.

Agent: Alright. And you mentioned you're seeing a red blinking light. Is there any amber or yellow lights, or is it just red?

Customer: Just red. One red blinking light.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me try something here. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem. This might take a minute or two. Can you watch it and tell me if anything changes with the lights?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Uh... nothing yet. Still just the red light.

Agent: Give it another minute. Sometimes these take a little bit to process. (pause) Anything?

Customer: Nope. Still red.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try a different approach here. Can you unplug the modem one more time and hold it unplugged for about two minutes this time? That'll be a deeper reset.

Customer: Sure, I can do that. (pause) (background noise - drawer opening) Okay, unplugging now. (pause) (pause) Alright, I'm waiting.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, lights are coming on... (pause) ...and there's the red blinking light again. Same thing.

Agent: (sigh) Alright. Um, I'm looking at the line here and I'm actually seeing a signal issue on our end. It looks like the signal coming into your area might have dropped. Have any of your neighbors mentioned having issues?

Customer: I don't know my neighbors that well, to be honest. But like... what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: So that could be an issue at the node level or possibly a problem with the line coming into your home. I'm not seeing any active outages reported in your area, which is... that's actually a little unusual. Let me see here... (typing sounds) (pause) I want to try one more thing. Can you tell me the model number on the modem? It should be on the back.

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, it says... "Frontier Modem Model FGW4B8."

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, FGW4B8. That's a good modem. Alright, I'm going to have you access the modem's web interface. Do you have a computer nearby?

Customer: Yeah, I'm on my computer right now, actually. What do I need to do?

Agent: Okay, so open up your web browser and go to 192.168.0.1 and see if you can access the modem settings page. Even though the internet isn't working, you should still be able to access it locally.

Customer: (typing sounds) (pause) Nothing's loading. It just says... like, it's not connecting.

Agent: It's not connecting at all?

Customer: No, I'm getting like a time-out error or something.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that's... that's actually pretty concerning. That usually means there's a hardware issue with the modem itself. Um, let me check the history here. (typing sounds) When was the last time you had any service done on your line?

Customer: Not recently. I've had this service for like three years and it's been working fine until today.

Agent: Right, okay. Well, what I'm thinking at this point is that we might be looking at a modem failure or there's a deeper issue with the line that we're going to need to send a technician out to diagnose. I'm not able to resolve this over the phone.

Customer: A technician? How long would that take? I really need my internet. I have meetings coming up later.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize. Let me check availability for you. (pause) (typing sounds) (pause) The earliest we have available is tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. We could also do tomorrow afternoon between 1 PM and 5 PM if that works better for you.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Of course. Um, I guess morning would be better. Can I do that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I have you down for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM. You'll get a courtesy call about 30 minutes before the technician arrives. Is the number we have on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. And just to recap, the technician will come out and diagnose whether this is a modem issue or something with the line itself. In the meantime, if you absolutely need internet, a lot of people use their mobile phone hotspot as a backup.

Customer: Yeah, I might have to do that. This is just... I really wasn't expecting this today.

Agent: I know, and again, I'm really sorry. We'll get you taken care of tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully the technician can fix it.

Agent: Hopefully so. Thanks for being patient with us, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Alright, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
