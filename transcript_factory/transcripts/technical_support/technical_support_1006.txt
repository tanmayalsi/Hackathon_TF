# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls scheduled this afternoon.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment... I've got you here. I see your account is associated with the address on Maple Street, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So your internet has been down since this morning, you said? And what exactly is happening? Do you have any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Well, the modem... let me look at it real quick. Um, there's like one light blinking on it. It's the power light, I think? But everything else is just... dark.

Agent: Okay, so just the power light is on. That's actually a good sign—it means the modem has power. The blinking light usually means it's trying to establish a connection. Have you tried unplugging it yet and plugging it back in?

Customer: Not yet, no. Do you want me to do that now?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Go ahead and unplug the modem for about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: (background noise, rustling) Okay, unplugged. I'm gonna count to thirty... (pause) ...alright, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. And while that boots back up, let me ask—did anything happen right before the internet went down? Like a storm, or did you lose power at all?

Customer: Actually, yeah. We had that bad storm last night. The power flickered a couple times, but I thought it came back on fine. You think that's what caused it?

Agent: It's definitely possible. Power surges can sometimes damage equipment or cause connection issues. (pause) Okay, and how many lights are showing up on the modem now?

Customer: Um... still just the one. It's still blinking. Maybe it needs more time?

Agent: Yeah, let's give it another minute or two. These things can be a little slow sometimes. While we wait, let me just verify—your modem is connected to the wall outlet with the cable line, right? The coaxial cable?

Customer: Yeah, it's plugged in. It's the cable that comes from outside.

Agent: Good. And that cable, does it look like it's firmly connected? Sometimes if they get bumped or jostled they can come loose.

Customer: (pause) Let me check... No, it looks pretty tight to me. Wait, actually... hold on. Let me see if there's a splitter on this...

Agent: A splitter?

Customer: Yeah, there's like a little device where the cable comes in. I'm not really sure what it does, but it's been there since we first got Frontier installed.

Agent: Okay, that could be part of it. If that splitter is damaged from the power surge, it could definitely cause connection problems. Can you see if there's any visible damage on it? Any burn marks or anything?

Customer: (pause) I mean... I don't really know what burn marks would look like, but it seems okay? It's just a little metal thing.

Agent: Alright, well let's try tightening the connections. Can you unscrew the cable from the splitter and then screw it back in? Nice and snug?

Customer: (background noise) Okay, doing that now. (pause) Got it tight.

Agent: Great. And did you see any lights change on the modem at all?

Customer: Um... (pause) No, still just the one blinking light.

Agent: Alright. Let me try one more thing here. Can you also check the back of the modem for a reset button? It's usually a small button, might be recessed.

Customer: (pause) A reset button... let me see. Yeah, okay, I think I see it. There's like a tiny indented button here.

Agent: Perfect. I'm gonna have you hold that down for about ten seconds. This will reset the modem to factory settings, which sometimes helps clear out connection issues. Be aware that you'll need to reconnect to your Wi-Fi after this.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...how's that?

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about two minutes for it to fully reboot. Do you want to stay on the line?

Customer: Yeah, sure. How long do you think this will take?

Agent: Usually a couple minutes for it to get back online. These modems can be a little finicky. (pause) So, um, have you been with Frontier for a while?

Customer: About three years now, I think? I've had pretty good service up until today.

Agent: That's good to hear. We appreciate the business. (pause) Okay, and how's that modem looking now? Any new lights?

Customer: Let me check... (pause) No, still just the power light.

Agent: Hmm, still blinking?

Customer: Yeah, it's still blinking. It's not changing.

Agent: Okay. (pause) What about the router? Do you have a separate Wi-Fi router?

Customer: Oh, yeah, I do. I didn't even look at that. Let me see... (pause) ...it's completely off. No lights at all.

Agent: Okay, is it plugged in?

Customer: I... yeah, I think so? Let me check behind here. (background noise) Oh. Oh, it's not plugged in. The cable came unplugged. I don't know how that happened.

Agent: No problem. Go ahead and plug that in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it in now. (pause) Alright, it's coming on. I can see some lights now.

Agent: Excellent. Good progress. Now, is your modem still blinking on that power light?

Customer: Yeah, still blinking.

Agent: [inaudible] So the modem isn't fully connecting yet. Let me check on my end if we're seeing a signal from your modem here. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm. I'm not seeing an active connection from your equipment.

Customer: What does that mean? Is it broken?

Agent: It could be a few things. It's either that the modem itself failed from the power surge, or there's an issue with the line coming in from outside. Since you mentioned the power flickered last night, the modem could have been damaged. But let me try a couple more things first. Let me have you check if there's a coax outlet anywhere else in your house, like in another room, that you could try plugging the modem into just to test.

Customer: Um, I think there might be one in the bedroom. Let me unplug this and carry it down the hall real quick. (pause, background noise of moving around) Okay, so I plugged it into the outlet in the other room.

Agent: Alright, and what's happening with the modem now?

Customer: (pause) Same thing. Just that one blinking power light. Nothing's changed.

Agent: I see. (pause) Okay, this is looking like it might be a hardware issue with the modem itself. Unfortunately, at this point it seems like the modem may have been damaged. I'm not seeing any signal on the line, and we've tried the standard troubleshooting steps.

Customer: So it's broken? Can you send me a new one?

Agent: I can definitely help you with that. Before I do, let me just ask—do you have any other devices you could test on that coax line, just to rule out that it's not a line issue instead?

Customer: (pause) I mean... not really. This is the only modem I have.

Agent: Alright. At this point, I think the best course of action is for us to send you a replacement modem. But I do want to schedule a technician to come out and check the line from the pole to your house, just to make sure everything on our end is okay, especially after that power surge.

Customer: Do I have to pay for that?

Agent: The modem replacement is covered under your service. However, if the technician determines the issue is something on your property, there could be a service call fee. But if it's an issue on our end, there's no charge.

Customer: How long until someone can come out?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) (pause) I can get a technician out to you... looks like we have availability tomorrow morning between 8 and 12. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? I really needed this today. I have calls this afternoon.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry about that. Let me see if there's anything earlier... (pause) Unfortunately, our next available slot for today would be around 5 PM this evening. That's the last appointment we have.

Customer: (pause) That's... that's pretty late. Can you guarantee they'll be able to fix it?

Agent: The technician will be able to assess the situation and either repair the line issue or confirm that it's the modem. But I do want to set the right expectation—with the modem not connecting at all and showing no signal from our end, it's likely a hardware replacement situation. Even if the technician comes out today, you may not have service restored until the replacement modem arrives, which typically takes 3 to 5 business days.

Customer: (pause) [inaudible] This is really frustrating. Is there anything else you can try?

Agent: I wish there was. I've gone through all the standard troubleshooting—the power cycle, the reset, testing different outlets. The fact that the modem isn't establishing any connection with our network, combined with the power surge you experienced, really does point to modem failure. I don't want to have you spend more time troubleshooting if we're just delaying getting you a replacement.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Yeah. Alright. Let's do the technician visit this evening at 5.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I have that set up for today between 5 and 6 PM. A technician will come to your address on Maple Street. And I'm also going to expedite a replacement modem to be sent out. Should arrive in 2 to 3 business days. You'll get a tracking number via email.

Customer: Alright, I guess that's... that's the best we can do then.

Agent: I really am sorry about this. We know how important your internet is. And when the tech comes out tonight, they can also double-check that everything is secure and working properly once the new modem arrives.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for calling Frontier, and sorry again for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.
