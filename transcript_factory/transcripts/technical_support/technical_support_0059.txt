# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I can't figure out what's wrong with it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: David Martinez.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got you here. So your service went down this morning—do you remember what time that happened?

Customer: Uh, probably around 8 AM? I was trying to work from home and suddenly everything just... stopped.

Agent: Okay, and just to confirm—you're not able to connect to the internet on any of your devices right now?

Customer: Right, nothing. My phone won't connect to the Wi-Fi, my computer... nothing. It's all dead.

Agent: Alright. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First thing I'd like you to do is locate your modem and router. Can you see them right now?

Customer: Yeah, they're, uh... (pause) ...they're right here on the shelf next to my TV. Why?

Agent: Great. I'm going to have you restart them for me. First, can you tell me what color the lights are on the modem right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...okay, so the modem is... it's mostly red. There's like a red light on top and I think... yeah, red on the side too.

Agent: Okay, so red lights usually indicate either a connection issue or a power problem. I need you to unplug the modem for me. Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: (sound of movement) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now let's also unplug the router.

Customer: (sound of movement) Done.

Agent: Alright, David. I want you to wait about 30 seconds. Just give the system a moment to reset. (pause) While we're waiting, have you had any issues with your service recently? Any outages or anything like that?

Customer: No, not really. It's been pretty solid until today.

Agent: Good to know. Okay, it's been about 30 seconds. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first, please.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Alright, plugged back in.

Agent: Perfect. Give that about a minute to boot up. You should start seeing lights come back on. What are you seeing now?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...okay, I'm seeing like... green lights now? That's better, right?

Agent: Yes, that's much better. Green lights mean it's connecting. Now go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay, router's back in.

Agent: Alright, give that about 90 seconds to fully boot up. While that's happening, can you tell me—when you say the internet stopped, did your modem completely lose power, or was it just the connection that went out?

Customer: It looked like... I think it was still on? Like the lights were on, but everything was just frozen. I couldn't get online.

Agent: Okay, so the equipment was powered, but no internet connection. That's helpful information. (pause) Go ahead and try connecting a device to your Wi-Fi now. Do you see your network showing up?

Customer: (pause) Uh... (pause) ...no. I don't see it.

Agent: You don't see your Wi-Fi network at all?

Customer: No, I'm not seeing it. That's weird.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) David, I'm showing your service as active from our end. How long has it been since you plugged the router back in?

Customer: Maybe like... 45 seconds?

Agent: Okay, it might still be booting. Let's give it another minute or so. In the meantime, let me ask—have you made any changes to your setup recently? Moved the equipment, updated anything, new devices...?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been the same setup for like a year now.

Agent: Alright. How about now? Are you seeing the network?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. This is frustrating. I have a meeting in like 20 minutes.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me try a few more things. Can you look at the back of your modem for me? I need you to tell me what cables are plugged in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so there's... a power cable, and then there's like a gray cable coming in from the wall... is that the coax cable?

Agent: Yes, that's the coax cable. That's correct. Is it firmly connected?

Customer: Seems like it to me. Pretty tight.

Agent: Okay, and what about the cable going to your router? Is that plugged in?

Customer: (pause) Let me check... yes, there's an ethernet cable connecting them.

Agent: Good. And that ethernet cable is plugged into the port on the modem that says "Ethernet" or something similar?

Customer: Uh... (pause) ...yeah, I think so? It's in one of the ports on the back.

Agent: Okay. What I'd like you to do now is unplug that ethernet cable and then plug it back in firmly. Make sure it clicks into place.

Customer: (sound of movement) (pause) Okay, replugged it.

Agent: Alright. Give that just a moment... (pause) How about now? Any change?

Customer: (pause) ...No. Still nothing. My router still isn't turning on or anything.

Agent: The router isn't turning on? Do you see any lights on the router at all?

Customer: Oh wait, hold on. (pause) I'm not seeing... let me check if it's actually plugged in. (sound of movement) Oh. Oh man. I think... I don't think it's getting power. Let me look at the outlet.

Agent: Okay.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay so my kid knocked over the power strip. The router wasn't actually plugged in. [inaudible] Let me plug it back in.

Agent: (brief chuckle) Hey, that happens. Go ahead.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay, it's plugged in now. (pause) Alright, I'm seeing the lights come back on. Blue light now.

Agent: Excellent. Give the router about a minute to fully initialize. This should get you back online.

Customer: (pause) Okay. I'm checking my phone... (pause) ...no, still don't see the Wi-Fi network. Nothing.

Agent: Hmm. Still not showing up?

Customer: No. This is weird. It was working fine yesterday. (pause) I'm looking at the router and I'm seeing like... a blue light and a green light, but there's like a red light blinking too.

Agent: Okay, so you've got a red light blinking. That's... that could indicate a WAN connection issue. Let me check the modem again. Are you still seeing green lights on the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the modem looks good. Still green.

Agent: Alright, David, I'm going to be honest—this is a bit unusual. Let me check our system to see if there's anything happening on our end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your line right now and... (pause) ...it looks like there may be something happening with the signal coming into your home. Are you in an area with any recent construction or weather issues?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of. It's been clear all morning.

Agent: Okay. I'm going to check our signal levels on your modem. Unfortunately, what I'm seeing suggests that the signal coming to your equipment may be degraded. That would explain why the modem connected but the router isn't able to get online.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is my internet just broken?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It could be an issue with the line coming into your house, it could be something in the network in your area... but right now it does appear to be a connection issue on our end rather than something wrong with your equipment.

Customer: Well, can you fix it?

Agent: That's what I want to try to do. (pause) Unfortunately, with what I'm seeing, I'm going to need to escalate this to our technical team. They have more advanced diagnostic tools than I do. I can schedule a technician to come out to your home and investigate the line and your equipment.

Customer: How soon can they come? I really need the internet working.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) We can have someone out to you today, actually. The earliest slot I have is between 1 and 3 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: That's... that's cutting it close with my meeting, but I guess I don't have much choice. Yeah, that works.

Agent: Great. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got a technician scheduled for today between 1 and 3 PM at your address. Your confirmation number is 4472891. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Hopefully they can figure out what's going on.

Agent: I'm sure they will. I do apologize that we weren't able to get this resolved over the phone, but I want to make sure you get the proper diagnosis. You should receive a confirmation email, and the technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive. Is the phone number on file still 555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. Well, I appreciate your patience today, David, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier Communications.
