Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got stuff I need to do for work, so I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I have your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... uh... (pause) 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm looking at your account for Robert Chen on Maple Street, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? When exactly did you first notice it stopped working?

Customer: Um, around 8 AM? I was trying to log into a meeting and nothing was loading. At first I thought it was just my laptop being slow, but then I realized the WiFi wasn't even connecting.

Agent: Okay, and have you done any troubleshooting on your end yet, or is this the first time you're looking into it?

Customer: I rebooted the router, you know, just unplugged it and plugged it back in. But that didn't help. The lights on it are... they're weird actually. Normally I see like, a solid green light but right now it's mostly amber and it keeps blinking.

Agent: Alright, that's actually helpful information. The amber light typically indicates a connection issue on our end. Let me just double-check a few things. Can you tell me what model router you have? It should be on a sticker on the back or bottom of the device.

Customer: (pause) It says... Frontier Model FX-3000 or... FXR-3000? One of those.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, that's our standard model. Good. And just to confirm, you did let it sit unplugged for a bit, right? Not just a quick reboot?

Customer: Yeah, I think I left it unplugged for maybe thirty seconds, then plugged it back in.

Agent: Okay. Here's what I'd like you to do. Can you unplug it again, but this time leave it unplugged for a full two minutes? That'll let the modem completely reset.

Customer: Okay, sure. (pause) Yeah, I'm unplugging it now. Should I wait the full two minutes or...?

Agent: Yes, the full two minutes would be best. While we wait, let me check if there are any service alerts in your area. (typing sounds) Let me see here... Hmm, I'm not showing any active outages in your neighborhood, which is good news.

Customer: (pause) Okay, two minutes are up. Plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Now what we're gonna do is wait for it to boot back up. That usually takes about another minute or so. While that's happening, just watch those lights. You should see them go through a sequence. First they'll be all orange, then they should start turning green as the modem connects back.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. The lights are orange right now... and um... (longer pause) ...still orange. Come on, come on...

Agent: Just give it another moment. Sometimes it takes a little longer.

Customer: (pause) Okay, one's starting to turn green now. Yeah, there's a green one. But I still have... like, three lights that are amber or orange.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's not quite right. Normally you should see mostly green by now. Let me ask you something—is your modem plugged into the wall outlet directly, or is it on a power strip?

Customer: It's on a power strip, yeah.

Agent: Okay, here's what I want you to try. Can you unplug the modem from the power strip and plug it directly into the wall outlet? Sometimes power strips can interfere.

Customer: (pause) Alright, unplugging from the strip... and... (fumbling sounds) ...okay, plugged it into the wall. Anything else?

Agent: Yeah, give it another minute to boot up again and let's see what happens.

Customer: (pause) Okay, starting up again. The lights are all orange again. Cycling through like you said... (pause) ...and... the green lights are coming back but... it's the same as before. I've got mostly orange and amber lights still.

Agent: Okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds, pause) I'm running a connection test from our network to your modem. (pause) Hmm. The modem is registering on our end, which is good, but it's showing an unstable connection. I'm not seeing proper signal strength coming back from your device.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is there something wrong with my modem?

Agent: It could be a few things. It might be the modem itself, or it could be something on our line to your house. Do you have a coaxial cable—that's the thick cable that comes in from outside—and do you know if it's securely connected?

Customer: (pause) The cable? Um... let me go look. (background noise) Okay, I'm looking at the back of the modem. There's a cable plugged in. It looks like it's... pretty tight, I think. I don't know if I can turn it any more.

Agent: Okay, that's alright. You don't want to force it. Um, let me think about this. Have you noticed any physical damage to the cable itself? Any cuts, or kinks, or anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Not that I can see, no. It looks fine to me.

Agent: Alright. Let me try a couple more things. Can you tell me if you see any blinking lights at all? Any red lights?

Customer: Red? No, no red lights. Just the orange and green ones, like I said. Most are orange.

Agent: [inaudible] ...reset the modem from our end. Let me try that. (pause, typing) Give me just one moment. (longer pause) Okay, I've sent a command to restart your modem remotely. You should see the lights go dark and then cycle back through.

Customer: (pause) Okay, the lights are going out... and... (pause) ...they're coming back now. Same thing. Orange again. (frustrated sigh) This is... this is not working.

Agent: I know, I'm sorry. This is frustrating. Let me look at the signal metrics here. (pause, typing) The signal strength is registering as critically low. That's... that's unusual because we're not showing any outages. It's possible there's an issue with the line running to your house, or there could be a problem with your modem's receiver.

Customer: So what do I do? Can you send someone out to fix it?

Agent: Let me check what options we have. (pause, typing) Okay, so we can definitely schedule a technician to come out and inspect the line and potentially replace your modem if that's the issue. How soon would you need someone to come by?

Customer: Uh, as soon as possible? I'm losing money here sitting without internet. I've got calls I need to make, emails to send...

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what availability we have. (pause, typing) Okay, looking at the schedule here... we have availability tomorrow afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Can't anyone come out today?

Agent: Let me check... (pause, typing) Unfortunately, our technicians are all booked for today. But if tomorrow afternoon works, we can get someone out there and we can get this resolved. 

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Tomorrow afternoon works. Do I need to do anything else?

Agent: No, that should be it. Just keep the modem powered on so our team can monitor it remotely if they need to. We'll have a technician there between 1 and 5 tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with before we finish up here?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it.

Agent: I do too, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get someone out there to take a look at it. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Have a good day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
