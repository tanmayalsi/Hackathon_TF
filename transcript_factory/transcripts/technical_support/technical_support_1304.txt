Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went out and I've been without it for like an hour now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your Frontier account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And just to confirm, I'm looking at an account for... James Richardson at 422 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage right now?

Customer: Yeah, complete. The modem's still on, the lights are... well, some of them are on, but I'm not getting any internet. I can't even load a webpage or anything.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Before we dig into this, let me ask you a few questions. First, have you restarted your modem yet?

Customer: Um... no, not yet. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, let's try that first. It's usually the quickest way to resolve connectivity issues. Just unplug the power cable from the back of the modem, wait about thirty seconds, and plug it back in. I'll stay on the line with you.

Customer: Okay, give me one second. (pause) (background noise of fumbling) Alright, unplugging it now...

Agent: Great. (pause) Now we're just gonna wait about thirty seconds. You can count it out if you want.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been about thirty seconds. Plugging it back in... (pause) The lights are coming back on.

Agent: Perfect. Now we need to give it a minute or two to fully reboot. While we wait, can you tell me if you've had any recent storms or any changes to your setup?

Customer: No storms or anything like that. Actually, now that I think about it, the power did flicker earlier today. Like a quick flicker. That might've been when it went out.

Agent: Ah, okay. That could definitely be it. A power surge can sometimes cause the modem to reset itself. (pause) Alright, go ahead and try loading a website on your computer or phone now. See if you're getting internet.

Customer: (pause) (typing sounds) Uh... no, I'm still not getting anything. The page isn't loading.

Agent: Still nothing? Okay. Let me check your account on our end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your modem status here and... hmm, it's showing as offline. Let me try to bring it back online from my end. (pause) Give me just one moment.

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I've sent a refresh signal to your modem. Give it about a minute to reconnect. While we wait, can you describe the lights on the modem for me? Which ones are lit up?

Customer: Um, okay. So there's like a... I guess a power light? That's solid white. Then there's one that says... I think it says "Internet" or something? And that one's... it's kind of off and on, flickering?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. That flickering light usually indicates it's trying to connect but something's preventing it from establishing a stable connection. Has the power light always been white and steady?

Customer: Yeah, it's always been white. But this flickering light, that's new.

Agent: Right. Let me try something else. I'm going to check the line status from our network side. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so on my end, I'm actually seeing an issue with the signal coming into your home. The line is really degraded.

Customer: What does that mean? Like, is something broken?

Agent: Not necessarily. It could be a few different things. There could be damage to the line outside, there could be an issue at our network hub in your area, or possibly something with the equipment on your end. But given the power flicker you mentioned, I want to rule out a few things first. Can you check the cables on your modem? Specifically the coaxial cable—it's the one with the threaded connector?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it. Yeah, it's... it looks pretty secure. I'm turning it anyway to make sure it's tight.

Agent: Good. (pause) Is it tight now?

Customer: Yeah, it seems snug.

Agent: Okay. Let me try resetting the modem one more time. This time we'll do a factory reset. To do that, I need you to find a small reset button. It's usually recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something pointy. It'll take about two to three minutes to fully reset.

Customer: Okay, hang on. (pause) I found it. It's a tiny button, right?

Agent: That's the one. Just hold it for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... holding it down... (pause) Alright, it's been ten seconds. The lights are all blinking now.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give it a few minutes to fully reboot and reconfigure. (pause) So, James, while we're waiting, have you had any recent issues with your service? Any outages or slowness?

Customer: No, it's been pretty reliable up until now. That's actually why I'm frustrated. Everything was working fine this morning.

Agent: Yeah, I totally get it. Okay, give it a try now. See if you're getting any connectivity.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. It's still flickering. Same as before.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay, let me try a different approach here. I'm going to check if there's any service alerts in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I don't see any reported outages, which is... actually a little unusual given what I'm seeing on my end. The signal degradation is pretty significant.

Customer: So what does that mean? Do I need to wait longer? Or...?

Agent: Unfortunately, I think this might be beyond what I can troubleshoot over the phone. The signal issue I'm seeing suggests there's a problem with the line coming into your home. That could be the modem itself, but more likely it's the external line or equipment at our network hub.

Customer: So you're saying you can't fix it?

Agent: Not remotely, unfortunately. What I can do is schedule a technician to come out to your home to do a full diagnostic. They'll check the external line, the modem, everything. And if there's something on our network side, they can address that too.

Customer: (sighs) Okay. How soon can someone get out here?

Agent: Let me check the availability. (typing sounds) (pause) Looking at tomorrow... we have an opening between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: [inaudible] I guess so. That's pretty annoying though. I need my internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. I wish I could get you back online right now. Let me just put that appointment in the system for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so that's tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive to narrow down the time window. Your confirmation number is 847592.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything I should try in the meantime? Like, should I keep it unplugged or...?

Agent: You can leave it plugged in. Honestly, at this point, probably won't make a difference, but there's no harm in trying one more restart if you want. But I wouldn't spend too much time on it. The technician tomorrow will be able to figure out what's going on.

Customer: Okay, I'll give it one more shot. But I'm not hopeful.

Agent: I hear you. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone, James. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll get you back online tomorrow. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
