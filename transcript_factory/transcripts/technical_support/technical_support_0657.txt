Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, my name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls coming up and I can't be without internet right now.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me get some information from you so I can help troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, this is for service at 342 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning? When exactly did you first notice it?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 8 o'clock. I tried to check my email and nothing was loading. I restarted the router and modem already, so don't ask me to do that again—I mean, I did it, but it didn't help.

Agent: (chuckles) I appreciate you already trying that. That's actually a good first step. So you've power cycled the equipment already. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the modem showing any lights?

Customer: Yeah, the modem has lights on it, but... uh... (pause) ...I don't think they're the right colors? Usually, the internet light is white or something, and right now it's like... red? Or orange maybe?

Agent: Okay, that's actually helpful information. So if I understand correctly, the internet light is showing red or orange instead of the normal white or green?

Customer: Right, exactly. Is that bad?

Agent: That typically indicates there's no connection to our network. Let me just pull up your account here and see if there are any service outages in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported. It looks like service is up and running in your neighborhood. Can you check for me—do you see a power light that's solid?

Customer: Uh, yeah. Yes, there's a light at the top that's solid green. And then the internet one is... yeah, it's definitely more orange-red.

Agent: Alright. And what about the ethernet light? That's usually one of the bottom lights. Is that showing anything?

Customer: (pause) I'm looking... I'm not really sure which one that is. There are several lights down there.

Agent: No problem. Is there maybe a small label next to the lights on your modem that says what each one is?

Customer: Oh, yeah! Yeah, let me... (pause) Okay, I see it. There's a little... it says "Internet" and then below it says "Ethernet" I guess. The ethernet one is green.

Agent: Okay, that's good. The ethernet light being green means there's a connection to the modem itself. So the issue is between our network and your equipment. Let me try something from my end here. I'm going to refresh your connection. This shouldn't take long. (typing sounds) Give me just a moment... (pause)

Customer: Okay, I'm waiting...

Agent: (pause) Alright, I've sent that refresh through. Can you look at the internet light again and let me know if anything changes?

Customer: (pause) Um... it's still orange. Maybe a little more red now if anything.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me try something else. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just the power cable—pull that right out of the back.

Customer: Sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now I want you to wait about 30 seconds. Just give it a moment to fully power down.

Customer: (pause) ...Alright, 30 seconds is up. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug it back in, and then we'll wait for it to boot back up completely. This usually takes about a minute or so. You'll see the lights come back on.

Customer: (pause) Okay... yeah, the lights are coming back. I can see them lighting up. (pause) Okay, the power light is green again. Now I'm waiting for the internet one... (pause) ...it's still orange.

Agent: Still orange, okay. (pause) I'm going to be honest with you, that's not what we want to see. Let me check something else here. Can you look at the back of your modem? I want to make sure the cable connection is secure.

Customer: The cable? You mean like the coax cable?

Agent: Yes, exactly. That's the thick cable that comes from the wall.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, it's connected. It looks like it's pretty tight.

Agent: Can you try unscrewing it slightly and then screwing it back in? Just to make sure it's secure?

Customer: (pause) Alright... (pause) ...okay, it's back in. Did that... did that help?

Agent: Let me pull your account again and see if that made a difference on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm still not seeing an active internet connection from your modem. This is unusual. [inaudible] Let me ask you—have you had any recent storms or anything like that in your area?

Customer: No, not that I know of. I mean, it was kind of cloudy this morning, but nothing crazy.

Agent: Okay. And no one's done any work on your line or anything in the neighborhood recently that you're aware of?

Customer: Not that I've seen, no.

Agent: Alright. (pause) I think... I think at this point, we might be dealing with a hardware issue on our end, or possibly an issue with your modem itself. I want to rule out the modem first. Do you happen to have a different ethernet cable you could try? Just to connect from the modem to your computer directly?

Customer: A different cable? Um... I think I might have one. Let me check. (pause) (background noise of drawers opening) Okay, I found one. Should I try it?

Agent: Yes, go ahead. Plug that into the ethernet port on the modem and then plug the other end into your computer.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged in. Now what?

Agent: Now check your computer. Do you see any indication that you have an internet connection?

Customer: (pause) No... no, it's still saying no connection. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I know, I'm sorry. I understand this is frustrating. At this point, I think we need to escalate this. There may be an issue with the line coming into your home, or it could be the modem itself needs to be replaced. I'd like to get a technician scheduled to come out to your location and do a full diagnostic.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) It looks like we have an opening tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we have Thursday morning between 9 AM and noon. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean, I really need this working today if possible. Do you have anything today?

Agent: (pause) Let me see if we have any same-day appointments... (typing sounds) (pause) Unfortunately, all our technicians are booked solid for today. Tomorrow is the earliest I can get someone out there.

Customer: (frustrated) Okay, yeah, I guess that'll have to work. Tomorrow afternoon is better for me.

Agent: Alright, perfect. I'll schedule that for tomorrow, 1 to 5 PM. A technician will come out and get this sorted for you. Is the phone number on file 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm one more time—342 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. You should receive a confirmation call or email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Hopefully the tech can figure out what's wrong tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident they will. Thank you for being patient with me while we troubleshot this, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, thanks. I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

Agent: Alright, thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
