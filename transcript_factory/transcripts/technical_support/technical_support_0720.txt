# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I've got work from home stuff I need to do and it's kind of urgent.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me definitely help you get this sorted out. Can I start by getting your account information? I'll need either your phone number or account number associated with your service.

Customer: Yeah, sure. It's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And what name is this account under?

Customer: Michael. Michael Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Alright, I've got you here. So you're saying your internet's been down since this morning? Did anything change before it went out? Like, did you restart your modem or router recently, or did you have any storms in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I just woke up and tried to check my email and... nothing. The modem's got lights on it, so it's powered, but I can't connect to anything.

Agent: Okay, that's good information. So the modem is powered on and you're seeing lights. Can you tell me what color those lights are and if they're solid or blinking?

Customer: Uh... (pause) ...there's a green light that's just sitting there, solid. And then there's a red light that's kind of blinking on and off.

Agent: Okay, so red blinking light—that usually indicates a connectivity issue. The good news is your modem's not completely dead. Michael, I'm gonna have you do a couple quick things for me. First, can you unplug the modem from the power for about thirty seconds and then plug it back in?

Customer: Yeah, sure. Give me one second. (sounds of movement, things shifting) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Just let it sit there for about thirty seconds. We're gonna let it fully power down.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Okay, and... (pause) ...plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. Now let's just watch those lights and see what happens. Sometimes it takes a minute to fully boot back up.

Customer: (long pause) Yeah, okay... I see the green light again. And now there's like a... an orange light that's blinking. Is that better?

Agent: (pause) The orange blinking light is actually still indicating it's trying to connect. Let me ask you this—do you have a router connected to the modem, or are you connecting directly?

Customer: I've got a router, yeah. It's a white one, I think it came with... the setup?

Agent: That sounds about right. So the router should also be showing some lights. Are you seeing any lights on the router at all?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...no. Actually, no lights on the router. Is that bad?

Agent: Well, it could mean a couple things. Let me have you try something—make sure the router is powered on. It should have a power cord plugged in.

Customer: (sound of movement) Okay, let me check. Oh, wait... I don't think it's plugged in actually. I think it might've gotten unplugged when [inaudible]... anyway, I'm plugging it in now.

Agent: Good catch.

Customer: Okay, so... (pause) ...lights are coming on. There's like a white light and... and it's blinking now.

Agent: Excellent. That's actually normal. The router should blink for a bit while it's connecting. Why don't you give it about a minute to fully boot up and establish a connection with the modem?

Customer: Alright, I'll wait. (long pause) So... how long have you worked there?

Agent: (slight chuckle) Oh, about three years now. I'm glad to help you out today though. Okay, Michael—have you had any internet issues with us before, or is this the first time?

Customer: First time, actually. I've been pretty happy up until now.

Agent: Good to hear. (pause) Alright, let's check back in on those lights. Are we seeing anything different on the router?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...it's still blinking. The modem's still showing that orange light too.

Agent: Okay, so they haven't fully synced up yet. Let me try something different. I'm gonna have you do what we call a factory reset on the modem. This will take about five minutes. What I need you to do is locate a small button—usually recessed—on the back of the modem. It's often labeled "reset."

Customer: (sound of rustling, movement) Okay, let me... I'm gonna flip it around. Um... (pause) ...I see something that says "reset." Is it this one?

Agent: That should be it. I need you to hold that button down for about ten to fifteen seconds. You might need a paperclip or something small.

Customer: (pause) Okay, using a pen. (pause, longer pause) Alright, I've been holding it. Lights are going crazy now—all different colors flashing.

Agent: Perfect, that's exactly what should happen. The modem is resetting itself. Just give it another minute or two to fully reboot.

Customer: (pause) Okay. (long pause) Nothing's changed yet. The orange light's back on the modem and the router's still blinking.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, let me check your line from here. Just give me one moment. (pause, longer pause) Okay, Michael, I'm not seeing any signal coming through on our end. That usually means either the line itself has an issue or the modem isn't communicating properly with our network.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Like, what do I do?

Agent: (pause) Well, unfortunately, it sounds like we might have a line issue here. The fact that the modem isn't connecting to us suggests there could be a problem with either the fiber line coming into your house or the network equipment on our end.

Customer: Oh, great. (pause) So you can't fix it?

Agent: Not from here, I'm afraid. But what I can do is set up a technician visit for you. We'd get someone out to physically check the line and the equipment. They can usually diagnose the exact problem.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so we have availability tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we have Thursday morning between 8 and 12 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow, I guess. Can they come in the morning instead? That afternoon window is pretty tight.

Agent: Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds, pause) Unfortunately, tomorrow morning is booked pretty solid, but I can put you down for that 1 to 5 PM window and make a note that you need us as early as possible.

Customer: (sigh) I mean... I guess that works. But I really need to get this working.

Agent: I hear you. I'll make sure that note gets flagged so they know to prioritize your call. And Michael? If something changes before the technician arrives—like if your internet suddenly starts working—just give us a call back and we can cancel the appointment.

Customer: Yeah, okay. So someone's coming tomorrow between 1 and 5?

Agent: That's correct. They'll have all your information. Do you have a cell phone number they could call if they're running early or late?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0189.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've added that to your work order. Your appointment is set for tomorrow, and a technician will be reaching out to you. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you troubleshoot?

Customer: No, I think... I think we've done enough troubleshooting. (pause) I'll just try to use my phone's hotspot or something until tomorrow.

Agent: That's a good backup plan. I apologize we couldn't get you up and running today, Michael. Is there anything else I can help you with before I let you go?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and I'm sorry for the inconvenience. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with your appointment details. Have a good day, Michael.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye.
