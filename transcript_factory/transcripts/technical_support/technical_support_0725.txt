Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so my internet just... it stopped working about an hour ago. One minute everything was fine and the next thing I know, nothing.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Great, James. Thanks for that. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Are you able to see any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Yeah, actually, let me look... okay so the modem has a green light on it, and then there's like... a red light blinking next to it.

Agent: Okay, so the green light is good—that means it has power. That red blinking light typically indicates a connection issue. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out completely.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now... (pause) ...it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Let's leave that unplugged for about 30 seconds while we're waiting. In the meantime, can you tell me—have you had any recent storms in your area, or has anything else changed with your setup recently?

Customer: No storms that I know of. It's actually pretty nice out. And nothing's changed... I mean, my roommate might've bumped something but I don't think so.

Agent: (pause) Alright, well that's worth checking after we get through this. Go ahead and plug that modem back in for me now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in... (pause) ...yeah it's back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now we're going to let it boot back up. That usually takes about two to three minutes. While that's happening, can you check your router for me? Is that powered on as well?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the router's on. It's got lights on it.

Agent: Okay good. (pause) And just to clarify, do you have the modem and router as two separate devices, or is it all in one box?

Customer: Two separate. Modem's in my bedroom and the router's out in the living room.

Agent: Got it. That's helpful to know. Give it another minute or so... Has the modem finished booting up? Are you still seeing that red light?

Customer: (pause) Um... yeah, still blinking red. The green light's still there too but that red one's still going.

Agent: Okay, that's... that's not ideal. Let me try a different approach. Can you try power cycling the router as well? Unplug that one for 30 seconds too.

Customer: Sure, one second. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we wait, let me pull up some information on your account here. (typing sounds) Okay James, I'm looking at your account and I'm not seeing any outages in your area. Your service should definitely be active. Let me ask—when you look at your devices, like your phone or laptop, are you seeing the router's WiFi network at all?

Customer: Oh, yeah! Actually, I can see the network name popping up. I can see it, yeah.

Agent: Okay, so the WiFi is broadcasting. Can you try connecting to it?

Customer: (pause) Yeah let me try... (pause) Okay so it's asking me for the password and I'm entering it... (longer pause) ...it's not connecting. It just says "can't connect to this network."

Agent: Hmm. Alright, go ahead and plug the router back in since we've waited the 30 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in. (pause) Still not connecting though.

Agent: I see. (pause) James, I want to try something else here. Can you check the cables for me? I need you to look at the cable going from your modem to the wall, and then also the cable between your modem and router. Can you make sure they're both firmly connected?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay... checking now... (pause) The one from the wall looks pretty secure... and the one between them... oh, actually, wait. This one might be a little loose. Let me push it in more.

Agent: Okay, try that.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it seems tighter now. Let me see if that helps... (pause) No, still can't connect to the network.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Okay, let me put you on a brief hold while I check something on the backend here. This shouldn't take more than a minute.

Customer: Sure, no problem.

(hold music plays)

Agent: (returning) Okay James, I'm back. So I'm checking our line to your address and I'm not seeing any issues on our end. The signal is coming through fine to the node. But I do want to try a factory reset on the modem. This will clear all the settings, so we can start fresh. Are you comfortable with that?

Customer: I mean... if you think it'll help, sure. What do I need to do?

Agent: Okay, so on the back of the modem, there should be a small button labeled "Reset." It might be recessed in a little hole. You might need to use a paperclip or a ballpoint pen to press it. Can you find that?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's a little button back here.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and press and hold that for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... (pause) ...okay I'm at about 10 seconds, releasing now.

Agent: Great. Now the modem's going to restart. This might take a few minutes. Let's give it three to four minutes and see if we get a different result on those lights.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) ...we're waiting. (pause) Actually, the red light just went away.

Agent: Oh! That's a good sign. What do you see now?

Customer: (pause) I see the green light is still there, and now there's like an orange light that's blinking.

Agent: Orange blinking usually means it's still initializing. That's normal. Give it another minute.

Customer: (longer pause) ...still orange. Still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Let me check something... (typing sounds) James, I'm looking at this and I want to be upfront with you—we're not seeing a normal boot sequence on this end either. I think the modem itself might be having a hardware issue.

Customer: Wait, so it's broken?

Agent: Well, it could be. It's unusual to see this pattern combined with the inability to connect. It's possible that the reset we did made things worse, or there was already something going on with the equipment. (pause) I hate to say this, but at this point I think we need to get a technician out to your place to physically inspect the modem and the lines coming in.

Customer: (sighs) Really? How long would that take?

Agent: Let me check our availability... (typing sounds) I'm showing we have a technician available tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could schedule you for Thursday afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works. What do I need to do?

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to set that up for you now. You'll get a confirmation text and email with the appointment details. The technician will look at the modem, check all the connections, and if needed, we can get you a replacement device. Make sure someone's home during that window.

Customer: Okay, yeah. I'll be here.

Agent: Great. I apologize we couldn't get this resolved today, James. I know how frustrating these things are.

Customer: Yeah, it's frustrating, but I appreciate you trying. I'm just glad someone can come out.

Agent: Absolutely. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for being patient with me today. We'll see you tomorrow morning. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
