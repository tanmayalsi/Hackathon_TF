Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging everything and... I don't know, I'm not really tech-savvy with this stuff.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. No problem at all—that's what I'm here for. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got it. So your internet went down about an hour ago. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router that might look different than usual?

Customer: Um... (pause) let me look. So I've got the white box... there's usually a blue light that's on, but right now I only see, like, a red light blinking on it. Is that bad?

Agent: Okay, a red blinking light typically indicates there's an issue with the connection. That's actually really helpful information. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem—that's the white box—and wait about thirty seconds, then plug it back in?

Customer: Sure, yeah. (background noise) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and count to thirty if you don't mind, then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) One, two, three... (pause) ...okay, that should be thirty. Plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's back on.

Agent: Perfect. Now, while that's booting back up, let me check something on our end. Can you tell me if you've had any recent storms in your area or any service issues that you're aware of?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been pretty nice actually. Um, it was just working fine this morning.

Agent: Understood. And the modem should be fully booted now—that usually takes about two to three minutes. Are you seeing any changes in the lights?

Customer: (pause) No, still just that red blinking light. Maybe a little less blinking, but... it's still red.

Agent: Okay. Let me check our service map in your area. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end, which is good news. That means it's likely an issue with your specific connection or equipment. Let's try one more thing. Can you check the cable that goes from the wall into the modem?

Customer: The cable? Um, yeah, I can... (background noise) ...I'm looking at it now. It looks pretty tight, but let me... let me try wiggling it just a little bit.

Agent: Good idea. Sometimes they can loosen up over time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I wiggled it... nothing changed. The light's still red.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm, you're definitely seeing that red light and not any blue or green lights at all?

Customer: No, just red. Well, I think there's a small orange light near the top, but mostly red blinking.

Agent: Okay, that orange light is normal—that's usually just a power indicator. The red blinking is what we need to focus on. Let me try a different approach. I'm going to send a signal to your modem from here to see if it helps establish a connection. This should only take a moment. Can you keep an eye on the lights while I do that?

Customer: Yeah, yeah. (pause) Okay, I'm watching it.

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) Alright, I've sent that signal. Do you see any change?

Customer: (pause) Uh... no, still the same. Red blinking.

Agent: Okay. Let me check something else here. (typing sounds) I'm going to ask you to try one more reset, but this time it's going to be a bit different. On the back of your modem, there should be a small button. Can you locate that for me?

Customer: A button? (pause) Um, I'm looking... I don't really... (pause) Oh, wait, there's something here. Is it like a little recessed button?

Agent: That's the one. Yeah, sometimes you need a paperclip or a pen to press it because it's recessed. That's the factory reset button. If we press that, it will erase all the settings and restore everything to default. We'd need to set things up again, but it might clear whatever's causing this issue.

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) I mean, I can try, but I'm a little worried about messing something up. What exactly would that do?

Agent: I understand. It would reset the modem completely, so we'd need to go through setup again, but I'd walk you through the whole thing. However, before we do that, let me try a couple other things first because that should really be a last resort. Let me put you on a brief hold—just for a minute—while I check with my supervisor about what else we can try. Is that okay?

Customer: Um, sure, yeah. That's fine.

Agent: Great. I'll be right back. (hold music plays for approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Thank you for holding. Okay, so I've consulted with my supervisor, and I have a couple more ideas. First, can you tell me—when you look at your router, the separate box, does it have power? Are there any lights on it?

Customer: Oh, the router! I didn't even... (pause) Yeah, okay, so the router has some lights on it. Let me see... there's a blue light, a green light, and... that one seems to be working fine.

Agent: Okay, good. So the router has power, which is good. That suggests the issue is really with the modem itself and the connection coming in from outside. Let me ask you something—have you noticed any other changes? Like, is there any burning smell or anything unusual around the modem?

Customer: No, no burning smell. It just looks fine, I mean, aside from the red light. It doesn't feel hot or anything.

Agent: Okay. So here's what I'm thinking. The modem might be having a hardware issue, or there could be a problem with the line coming into your house. I'd really like to send a technician out to check both the equipment and the line to see what's going on. How does that sound?

Customer: A technician? Um... (pause) ...how long would that take? Like, when could they come out?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) I can see our next available appointment would be... tomorrow afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Is there anything sooner? Like, what about tonight?

Agent: Let me see... (typing sounds) Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day appointments available in your area today. Tomorrow's the soonest we can get someone out. I know it's frustrating.

Customer: Yeah, that's... (pause) ...that's not ideal, but I guess that's better than nothing. Can I ask—is there any way to get internet working in the meantime? Like, is there anything else I can try?

Agent: That's a good question. Um, honestly, at this point we've exhausted most of the troubleshooting steps I can do over the phone. The red light on the modem really indicates a connection issue that's beyond what we can fix remotely. Your best bet would be to use mobile hotspot from your phone if you have that available.

Customer: Oh, right. Yeah, I have unlimited data, so I could do that, I guess. Okay. (pause) So I should just schedule the technician for tomorrow?

Agent: Yes, let me set that up for you right now. (typing sounds) Alright, I've scheduled a technician appointment for tomorrow, December 14th, between 1 and 5 PM. You should receive a confirmation text message and email shortly. The technician will examine your modem and the line connection to determine what the issue is.

Customer: Okay, got it. Um, and they'll hopefully be able to fix it while they're here?

Agent: Most likely, yes. If it's a hardware issue with the modem, they can replace it on the spot. If it's a line issue, they'll repair that as well. Either way, they should be able to get you back online.

Customer: Alright. Well, thank you for trying to help me with that. I appreciate it.

Agent: Of course. I'm sorry we couldn't get it sorted out today, but we'll get this taken care of for you tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with while I have you on the line?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye.
