Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, uh, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I need to get this fixed pretty urgently.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at the account for... is this Michael Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet service went down this morning? Do you remember approximately what time that happened?

Customer: Yeah, I'd say around 8 or 9 AM. I woke up and tried to check my email and there was nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Alright. And are you able to see any lights on your modem right now? Just take a quick look if you can.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. Um... the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light—I think it's the one that's usually blue—that one's not on. It's just... dark.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. The internet light being off could mean a few things. Let me have you try a quick restart. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet for about 30 seconds?

Customer: Sure, give me a second. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just hold it unplugged for about 30 seconds while I'm here with you. (pause) That should do it. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) Alright, it's back in. I can see the lights coming back on.

Agent: Good. The modem should go through its boot-up cycle. This usually takes about a minute or two. While we're waiting, have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, this is the first time. Usually it's pretty reliable. The internet's been fine up until today.

Agent: That's good to know. And you're not aware of any weather or construction happening in your neighborhood?

Customer: Not that I know of, no. It's been clear all morning.

Agent: Alright. (pause) So how are those lights looking now?

Customer: Um... (pause) The power light is still green, but the internet light is still off. Nothing's changed, really.

Agent: Okay, that's... hmm. Let me try something else. Do you have a router separate from the modem, or is it a combination unit?

Customer: I think it's just one unit. It's the white box that Frontier installed.

Agent: Right, that's our combo unit then. Okay, let's try a factory reset. I know this sounds drastic, but it might clear up whatever's causing the issue. On the back of the unit, there should be a small reset button. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's like a little indented button, right?

Agent: Exactly. I'm going to have you hold that down for about 10 seconds. It's going to reset the whole thing back to factory settings, so we'll need to set it up again, but it might solve the problem.

Customer: Okay... (pause) I'm holding it down. (pause) Okay, it's done. Everything's blinking now.

Agent: Good, that means it's resetting. This could take a few minutes. While that's happening, let me check your line from our end to see if there's an issue with the connection to your home. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, that's interesting.

Customer: What? What's interesting?

Agent: Well, I'm not seeing an active connection from our end right now. It's almost like the modem isn't registering on our network. That could mean a few things—it could be a line issue, or there might be an equipment problem.

Customer: (sighs) So what does that mean? How do we fix it?

Agent: Let me finish checking a couple of things. Can you tell me, do you see any lights on the modem now? Any internet light?

Customer: (pause) Uh, no. Just the power light. Everything else is dark.

Agent: Okay. And how long ago did you hold that reset button?

Customer: Maybe... two minutes ago?

Agent: It should be booted up by now. That's concerning. I'm going to be honest with you—it sounds like there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or possibly something with the line coming into your house. Do you have anyone else in your household you can ask? Someone who might've noticed anything unusual?

Customer: No, I live alone. This is just... I really need this working today. Is there anything else we can try?

Agent: Let me have you do one more thing. Can you check the back of the modem? There are cables connected to it—specifically the coaxial cable, which is the one with the metal connector. Can you unplug that and check to see if there's any debris or anything inside the connection point?

Customer: (pause) Alright, let me... (pause) Okay, I've got it unplugged. Let me look... (pause) No, it looks clean to me. The connector looks fine.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug that back in. (typing sounds) (pause) You know what, let me check with my supervisor to see if there's anything else we can try from the technical side. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) (pause) Okay, I'm back. So I've checked everything I can on this end, and I'm not picking up any signal from your line. We're not seeing any outages reported in your area, but it does seem like there's either a problem with the equipment or with the line itself. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to your house to diagnose what's happening.

Customer: A technician? How long is that going to take?

Agent: Well, let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) I have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. Or if you need something sooner, we might be able to get someone out this afternoon, but that's going to be a tight squeeze. Let me see... (typing sounds) (pause) Unfortunately, today's pretty booked. Tomorrow morning would be your next option.

Customer: (pause) This is... okay. I guess tomorrow morning. But I really needed this working today.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I apologize that we weren't able to get this resolved over the phone. The technician will definitely be able to figure out what's going on. It could be something simple once they get here.

Customer: Okay. What time tomorrow should I expect them?

Agent: I have an 8 AM to noon window. I'll need to get a contact number for them. Is 555-0147 the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yes, that should work.

Agent: Perfect. I'm gonna schedule that for you. They may arrive anywhere within that window, but they'll call you about 30 minutes before they arrive. Is that alright?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Again, I'm sorry we couldn't get this fixed today. We'll have you back up and running as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you for trying anyway.

Agent: Of course. Thanks for being patient with me. Have a great day, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Alright, bye.

Agent: Bye.
