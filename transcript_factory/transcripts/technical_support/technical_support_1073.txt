# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I've got a work meeting in like an hour and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I totally understand the urgency there. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. Account for Michael Chen at 2847 Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember approximately what time that happened?

Customer: Uh, I'd say around 7:30 or so. I tried turning everything off and back on, which is usually what works, but this time it didn't help.

Agent: Okay, I appreciate you already trying that. That's a good first step. So just to clarify—when you say it's down, are you seeing any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) So the modem has a red light on it. The router is... dark. Like, completely off.

Agent: Alright, so the modem's showing red. That typically indicates either a connection issue or a power problem. Let me ask you this—is the modem plugged in directly to a power outlet?

Customer: Yes, it's definitely plugged in. I checked that.

Agent: Good. And are you using the power cable that came with the modem, or did you plug it into a different one?

Customer: No, it's the original cable.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so here's what I'd like you to try. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet? Just pull it straight out.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now just leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. While you're waiting, let me check on our end to see if there are any service issues in your area. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any major outages reported on Maple Street, which is a good sign. Can you plug that modem back in now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's back in. (pause) Um... the light's still red though.

Agent: Okay, it might take a minute or two to fully boot up. Sometimes these things need a moment. Give it about two minutes and see if the light changes. Is it blinking red, or is it solid red?

Customer: It's... solid red. Just sitting there.

Agent: Hmm, alright. That's unusual. Let me ask you—have there been any recent storms in your area? Any weather issues?

Customer: No, no. It's been sunny all morning.

Agent: Okay. So the router is completely unpowered, you said?

Customer: Yeah, it's not on at all.

Agent: Can you plug that in as well? Just make sure the power switch is on.

Customer: (pause) Oh wait. Actually... oh. (pause) Oh man, I think I might've... I think the power strip that the router was plugged into got switched off somehow. Let me just... (background noise of something plugging in) okay, turning it back on...

Agent: (chuckles) Hey, it happens. These things hide back there and kids or pets or... you know.

Customer: (laughs) Yeah, no kids or pets, just me being careless probably. Okay, so the router's on now. It's got lights on it. The modem still has the red light though.

Agent: Okay, so progress on the router side. The modem red light—that's still the issue we need to solve. Let me have you try something else. Is there a reset button on the modem? It's usually pretty small, might be recessed.

Customer: (pause) Um, I see it. There's a little button. Do I...?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and press and hold it for about ten seconds. That'll give it a full reset.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it down... (pause) ...and releasing. Now what?

Agent: Now just let it sit for a couple minutes and boot back up from scratch. This sometimes clears out any glitches that might be causing that red light.

Customer: (pause) Alright. I'm gonna watch it here... (long pause, background noise of waiting) ... still red. Still... still solid red.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's not ideal. Let me ask—is there any cable coming into your modem? Like, from the wall or anywhere?

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) Yeah, there's a cable that goes into the back. It comes from the wall outlet there.

Agent: Okay, that's the coaxial cable. Can you trace where it's coming from? Is it connected to your wall outlet properly? Sometimes these can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) It looks pretty secure to me. I mean, it's connected. I can try wiggling it to see if that helps?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and just give it a gentle tug to make sure it's snug. Sometimes they come loose on one end or the other.

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Okay, I'm tugging on it... it seems pretty tight. Wait, actually, let me check the wall side. (pause) Oh, huh. This one actually is a little loose. Let me screw this back in... (sound of connection) Okay, that's tighter now.

Agent: Great! Now let's check on that modem light again.

Customer: (pause) Still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Alright, I appreciate your patience here. Um, I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I escalate this to our technical team. This is beyond basic troubleshooting, which means we might be looking at a modem issue or something on the line side that I can't diagnose from here. Will that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, sure. But like... how long is this gonna take? I really do have that meeting coming up.

Agent: I totally understand. I'm going to get you to the right person as quickly as I can. Let me just put you on hold for just one moment. It should be quick.

(hold music)

Agent: Okay, Michael? I'm back. I've got our technical team standing by, and they want to run a few more diagnostics. Let me connect you to them right now. It's going to be Jennifer from our tech support team. Before I transfer you over, I'm just going to note in your account here that you've tried resetting the modem, checking the cable connections, and the light is still showing red. That should help her move faster. Is there anything else you want me to add?

Customer: I guess just... like, is there any way to get a technician out here today? I don't want to get stuck on the phone for too long.

Agent: That's a totally fair ask. Jennifer will be able to help you with that as well. Let me get you transferred now.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: Alright, Michael, thanks for working through all this with me. I'm transferring you to Jennifer now. Jennifer, this customer's modem is showing a solid red light, we've tried the standard troubleshooting steps, and they're hoping to get this resolved ASAP. Go ahead and take it from here.

(brief hold tone)

Jennifer: Hi Michael, thanks for your patience. I'm Jennifer. I've got your notes here. Let me start by asking—have you experienced this issue before, or is this the first time?

Customer: First time. Yeah, never had a problem before.

Jennifer: Okay. And just to confirm, you reset the modem, checked all the cables, and the light is still solid red?

Customer: Yes, all of that. It's been about five minutes now since the reset too, so it should definitely be booted up by now.

Jennifer: (typing sounds) Yeah, that's plenty of time. Okay, so from my end, I'm looking at your line here, and I'm actually seeing... hmm. (pause) It looks like we might not be getting a proper signal on this end. That would explain the red light on your modem. This could be a few things—it could be a line issue, a splitter issue, or potentially the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? What do I do?

Jennifer: Well, here's what I want to try first. Behind your modem, are there any other cables plugged into it besides the one from the wall? Like, do you have a splitter or anything?

Customer: Um, no. Just the one cable from the wall and then... ethernet cables going to my computer.

Jennifer: Okay, so no splitter. Can you unplug that coaxial cable from the modem for just a second? The one coming from the wall. And tell me if you see anything interesting about it or the port.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, unplugged. Um... it looks normal to me. I don't see anything weird.

Jennifer: Okay, just plug it back in for me. (pause) So I've already checked on this end, and we're definitely not receiving a proper signal from your line. At this point, what I'm thinking is we've got two possibilities. One is that there's an issue with the line itself, which would require a technician to come out and check the physical connection. Or two, it's possible your modem is defective, in which case we'd need to replace it. To determine which one it is, we'd really need someone to come out.

Customer: So I can't fix this myself?

Jennifer: I wish I could tell you otherwise, but no, not with what I'm seeing. I'm really sorry. But the good news is, I can schedule a technician for you. We do have availability today, actually. Would you be able to be home between 2 and 4 PM this afternoon?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I can do that. It's not ideal, but... what choice do I have?

Jennifer: I really appreciate your flexibility. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, that's all set. You'll have someone out at your place between 2 and 4 PM today. Their name is Marcus—Marcus Rodriguez. He'll call you about 30 minutes before he arrives. In the meantime, just keep everything as it is, okay? Don't do any more troubleshooting or unplugging things.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Should I expect this to be fixed today, or is this gonna be a whole thing?

Jennifer: (pause) I wish I could guarantee it, but I can't know for sure until Marcus gets there and diagnoses the problem. If it's a line issue, it could be a quick fix. If it's the modem, we can replace it on the spot. Either way, he should be able to get you back online. If there's something more complicated, he'll let you know, but I don't anticipate that being the case.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I guess that's... that's better than nothing. So Marcus is coming between 2 and 4.

Jennifer: That's correct. Michael, I'm really sorry you're dealing with this, especially on a day when you've got meetings to get to. Unfortunately, we weren't able to resolve this remotely, but I'm confident we'll get you back up and running today.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks for trying anyway, I guess.

Jennifer: Of course. You've got everything you need then?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. 2 to 4 PM, guy named Marcus. Got it.

Jennifer: Perfect. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and I'm sorry again for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye, Michael.
