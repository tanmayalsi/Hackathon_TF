# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here... and I've got you. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. So your internet's been down since this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, like since around 8 AM. I tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in, which is what I usually do when things get weird, but nothing happened this time.

Agent: Good thinking on that. That's usually the first step. Let me ask you a few questions. Are you seeing any lights on your modem or router right now? Any lights at all?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) Okay, so the modem is totally dark. Like, no lights. But the router has... it has the power light on, I think. Yeah, it's blinking green.

Agent: Alright, so the modem is completely dark. That's helpful information. Can you check if it's actually plugged in? Sometimes the cable comes loose.

Customer: Yeah, I already checked that. It's definitely plugged in. The power cable's secure.

Agent: Okay, good. Let me have you do this for me. Can you unplug the modem for about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in? And while you're doing that, I'll wait on the line.

Customer: Sure, hold on. (pause) Unplugging it now... (pause) ...okay, waiting... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in. (pause) Hmm, nothing. Still dark.

Agent: Still no lights?

Customer: No, nothing.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me check something here. Is there a small reset button on the back of the modem? Sometimes it's recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something.

Customer: There is, yeah. Should I press that?

Agent: Not yet. Let me first check if we're showing any issues on our end. (pause) (typing sounds) Hmm, okay, so I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, and everything looks normal on your account. Let me have you try the reset. Go ahead and hold that button for about 10 seconds with something small.

Customer: Okay... (pause) (sounds of button being pressed) ...holding it... (pause) ...and releasing. (pause) Now I'm waiting to see if... (longer pause) ...nope. Still nothing. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand. This can definitely be annoying. Okay, so the modem isn't powering up at all. That's actually a good clue that it might be a hardware issue with the modem itself. But before we go down that road, let me ask you something. Do you have any other outlets you could try plugging it into? Just to make sure it's not a power issue with that particular outlet.

Customer: Oh, that's a good point. (pause) Let me try over there... (pause, sounds of unplugging and movement) (pause) Plugging it in over here... (pause) Nope. Still nothing.

Agent: Still no lights at all?

Customer: Correct. Nothing.

Agent: (pause) Okay. And just to confirm, you're using the power adapter that came with the modem, correct? Not a different one?

Customer: Yeah, it's the one that came with it. I haven't changed anything about the setup.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else. Can you check the back of the modem where the power cable connects? Sometimes there's a little light near the power port. Do you see anything there?

Customer: (pause) Let me look real close... I don't see anything. The whole thing is just... dark. Dead.

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, okay. I think what we're dealing with here is a modem failure. These things can sometimes just stop responding. The fact that you're not getting any power indicator at all suggests the unit itself isn't functioning.

Customer: So you're saying the modem is broken?

Agent: That would be my assessment, yes. I know that's not what you want to hear, but the good news is we can get you a replacement. Now, before I do that, let me just... (pause, typing sounds) ...let me see what your options are here. We can have a technician come out, or we can do a mail-in replacement if you want something quicker.

Customer: How long would that take?

Agent: So if we do a technician visit, we can get someone out there as early as tomorrow, depending on availability in your area. A mail-in replacement would take about 3 to 5 business days.

Customer: A technician tomorrow would be better. Can we do that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me just... (typing sounds) (pause) ...pull up the availability... (longer pause) I'm seeing... okay, so tomorrow we have availability between 1 and 5 PM in your area. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works. That should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so I've got you scheduled for tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will bring a new modem and get you set up. But let me just try one more thing before we hang up here, just to be thorough.

Customer: Sure, go ahead.

Agent: Can you try disconnecting the coax cable—that's the cable that comes from the wall into the modem—and just wait about 30 seconds, and then reconnect it?

Customer: (pause) Already disconnected it... (pause) ...waiting... (pause) reconnecting. (pause) And... nothing. Still dark.

Agent: (sigh) Yeah, I think we've exhausted the troubleshooting options. I'm pretty confident at this point it's a hardware failure. The good news is you're all set for tomorrow. You should receive a confirmation email shortly, and the technician will contact you in the morning with a more specific window.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, I appreciate you trying. This is just... I had a lot of work I needed to do today.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm sorry about that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully tomorrow gets sorted out.

Agent: It will. We'll take care of you. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too.
