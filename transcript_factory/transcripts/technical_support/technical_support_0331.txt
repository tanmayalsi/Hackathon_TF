# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I definitely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account real quick so we can get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... uh... (pause) it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm showing an account here for... David Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, David. So you mentioned your internet has been down since this morning. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, since like around 8 AM. I tried turning the router off and back on, which is what I usually do, but it didn't work this time.

Agent: Okay, good thinking. That's typically a good first step. So when you say the internet is down, are you seeing any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Um, let me check. (pause) Okay, so the modem has... the power light is on, it's just solid green. But the internet light—I think it's labeled "online"—that one is red.

Agent: Alright, that's actually helpful information. The red light on the online indicator tells me there's likely an issue with the connection itself. Let me ask you a few more things. Have there been any recent storms in your area, or have you noticed any recent changes to your setup?

Customer: No, we haven't had any storms or anything. It was working perfectly fine yesterday. I literally used it last night with no issues.

Agent: Understood. And just to confirm, the power light is green, but that online indicator is red. Now, let me have you try something for me. Can you unplug the modem from the power source?

Customer: Sure, unplugging it now. (pause)

Agent: Okay, go ahead and leave that unplugged for about thirty seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been like thirty seconds. Should I plug it back in now?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged it back in. Now what?

Agent: Now let's just give it a moment to boot back up. This should take about a minute or so. While that's happening, can you tell me—do you have a separate router, or is this a combined modem and router unit?

Customer: It's combined. It's the one Frontier provided when we set up our service a couple years ago.

Agent: Got it. And are you connected to the modem via Wi-Fi or ethernet cable?

Customer: Wi-Fi. I'm on my laptop right now.

Agent: Alright. And do you see the Wi-Fi network name appearing from the modem?

Customer: Um... (pause) yeah, the network is showing up. I can see the name and everything. It's just not connecting to the internet.

Agent: Okay, so the Wi-Fi is broadcasting, but you can't access the internet through it. That's good information. (typing sounds) Let me check our system here to see if there are any outages in your area... (pause) I'm not showing any widespread outages currently. Let me have you try reconnecting to the Wi-Fi network. Sometimes the connection just needs to be refreshed. Can you disconnect from the network and then reconnect?

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) I'm disconnecting now... (pause) alright, I'm reconnecting... and entering the password... (pause) It says connected. But I still don't have internet.

Agent: Hmm, okay. The online light on the modem—has that changed at all since we rebooted it? Is it still red?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's still red. Still no change there.

Agent: Alright. Let me try a different approach. I'm going to have you do a full factory reset on the modem. This will clear everything, so just be prepared that you'll need to reconnect after this. Are you comfortable with that?

Customer: Um, I guess so? I mean... if that's what we need to do.

Agent: Okay, great. On the back of the modem, there should be a small reset button. It might be recessed. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's like a tiny button in a little hole, right?

Agent: That's exactly it. Go ahead and hold that down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... and... (pause) okay, I let go. The lights all went off and now they're coming back on.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give it another minute to fully restart. (pause) Okay, so while we're waiting, I'm going to look through your account to see if there's anything else that could be affecting the connection... (typing sounds, pause) I'm not seeing any service issues on my end or any account restrictions. Let me ask you—when the modem is fully booted up, can you tell me what color that online light is?

Customer: (pause) It's... still red. It's just red still.

Agent: Still red. (pause) Okay, David, I'm going to be honest with you. The fact that light isn't turning green is indicating a problem with the connection from the modem itself. That usually means either there's an issue with the line coming into your house, or the modem might have developed a hardware issue.

Customer: Oh, man. That's... that's not what I want to hear. So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, the good news is we can get a technician out there to take a look at everything. They can check the line, check all the connections, and if there's an issue with the modem, we can get you a replacement. But I unfortunately can't get that resolved over the phone. I can schedule a tech visit for you though.

Customer: How long does it usually take to get someone out here?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our schedule... Okay, so I'm showing availability for tomorrow between 12 PM and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I was really hoping to get this fixed today. I have a bunch of work I need to do.

Agent: I completely understand, and I wish I had same-day availability, but we're pretty booked up today. Tomorrow is really the earliest I can get someone out there. It shouldn't take too long once they arrive—usually about an hour or so depending on what they find.

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, okay. I guess tomorrow is better than nothing. Can you do earlier in the morning though? Like, before noon?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see... (pause) Actually, I do have an 8 AM to 12 PM slot available tomorrow morning.

Customer: Yeah, that's better. Let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. So I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, between 8 AM and 12 PM. A technician will come out and diagnose the issue. The address I have on file is 447 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And what's the best phone number to reach you on tomorrow?

Customer: (pause) The number you called me on should be fine.

Agent: Okay, perfect. And just to make sure you're aware—there will be a service call fee of $99 if the issue is determined to be on the customer's end. If it's on our network side, that will be waived.

Customer: So I might have to pay for this?

Agent: Possibly, depending on what the tech finds. But if it's a line issue or if the modem is defective, which it very well could be given what we've seen here, there would be no charge.

Customer: Alright... (pause) Well, I guess there's not much else we can do tonight then.

Agent: No, unfortunately not. But the good news is we'll get this resolved tomorrow. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details of the appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... fingers crossed it gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I hope so too, David. I know this is inconvenient. We really appreciate your business, and we'll get you back up and running as soon as we can. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus. Appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good evening.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
