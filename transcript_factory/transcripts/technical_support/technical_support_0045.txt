# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet just went out completely. I've been without service for like the last two hours and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... uh, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And your name?

Customer: It's Michael. Michael Torres.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got your account right here. I can see you're on our fiber service at your address on Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Alright. So let's do some quick troubleshooting here. First things first—can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is your modem powered on?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's on. I can see the lights, but... I don't know, they're not doing what they usually do. Like, normally there's a solid blue light, but now it's just like... orange or amber or something. And it's blinking.

Agent: Okay, okay. That amber blinking light actually can indicate a few different things. Can you look at the modem for me and tell me—do you see a light labeled "Internet" or maybe "Online"?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see one that says "Internet." It's... it's red.

Agent: Red, got it. Alright, and is there a power button on the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I see it.

Agent: Great. What I'd like you to do is hold down that power button for about ten seconds until the modem shuts completely off. All the lights should go dark.

Customer: (pause) Okay... yeah, they're all off now.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about thirty seconds before we turn it back on. Just give it a moment to fully power down.

Customer: (longer pause) Alright, thirty seconds is up.

Agent: Go ahead and press the power button again to boot it back up.

Customer: (pause, then typing sounds in background) Okay, I'm pressing it... the lights are coming back on now.

Agent: Good. Let's give it maybe a minute or two to fully restart. While that's happening, I'm going to check a few things on my end here. Can you tell me—have you noticed any issues with the service over the last few days? Any outages in your area, or did anything happen before it went out?

Customer: Uh, no, nothing unusual. I was just working from home, everything was fine, and then... it just died. No warning or anything.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end, so that's good news. How's that modem looking now?

Customer: Um... well, the lights are on. But they're still... the Internet light is still red. And it's still blinking.

Agent: Still red, okay. Hmm. Michael, I'm going to ask you to do something else for me. Can you check the cable that's coming into your modem from the wall? It's the cable that looks kind of like a coaxial cable—it's thicker than an ethernet cable?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I see it. It's plugged in pretty tight.

Agent: Okay, can you unplug it anyway, just pull it out from the back of the modem, and then plug it back in firmly?

Customer: (pause, rustling sounds) Okay... unplugging... now plugging back in. There we go.

Agent: Alright. And while you do that, let me also check if there's a backup power source on that modem. Do you see a battery backup unit? It might be like a box or rectangle attached to or near the modem.

Customer: No, I don't see anything like that. It's just the modem, and there's an ethernet cable, and... yeah, that's it.

Agent: Got it. Okay, so we've rebooted the modem and reseated the cable. Let's give it another minute. [inaudible] is anything changing with that Internet light?

Customer: (pause) No, it's... it's still red. And still blinking. This is... I really need this fixed. I have a meeting in like an hour.

Agent: I understand, and I'm going to do everything I can to help you here. Let me try something else. Can you tell me what color your modem is?

Customer: It's white. It's, uh... it's a Frontier-branded one.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, white Frontier modem. That helps. Michael, there's a small reset button on the back of your modem—it's usually recessed in a little hole. Do you see that?

Customer: (pause) Oh, yeah, I see it. There's a tiny hole with a... looks like there's a button in there.

Agent: That's the one. Now, I want to be careful here because pressing this will reset the modem to factory settings, which means you'll have to set it up again. But given what we're seeing, it might help. Are you okay proceeding with that?

Customer: [inaudible] ...will I lose my settings?

Agent: Yes, the modem will go back to its default factory settings. Your internet service should still be recognized, though. We can reconfigure it if needed.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah. Let's try it. What do I do?

Agent: You'll need something small and pointy—like a paperclip or a pen—and press and hold that reset button for about ten to fifteen seconds. Ready?

Customer: (pause, rustling sounds) Okay, I'm pressing it... holding it... (pause) How long should I hold it?

Agent: Keep holding. You should see all the lights go out and then start blinking. Another few seconds...

Customer: (pause) Okay, the lights are all going crazy now. Blinking all over the place.

Agent: Good, good. Now let it boot back up. This might take a couple of minutes. Don't touch anything while it's starting up.

Customer: (longer pause, background noise) Alright, it's been like a minute... Is this normal?

Agent: Yeah, it should take maybe two to three minutes total. Let's give it another moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay, um... the lights are... they're settling down. But that Internet light is... [inaudible] ...is it supposed to be solid blue now?

Agent: That would be ideal, yes. What are you seeing?

Customer: It's... it's still amber. Or orange. Not red anymore, but it's still not blue.

Agent: (pause) Still not blue. Okay. That's... let me think about this for a second. (typing sounds) Michael, let me check your account. Is there anything I should know? Any recent changes, or have you recently received a bill?

Customer: (pause) Um, my bill is current. I think I paid it like two weeks ago.

Agent: Okay, that's not it then. (pause, typing sounds) Alright, so from what I'm seeing, the modem itself seems to be powered on and running, but it's not connecting to our network. That amber light usually means it's searching for a signal or there's a connection issue on our end.

Customer: So what does that mean? What do I do?

Agent: (pause) Well, I'm going to be honest with you—if the modem has gone through a full reboot and a factory reset and we're still not getting that solid blue Internet light, there might be an issue with either the line coming into your house or the modem itself. It's possible the modem has failed.

Customer: Can you... I mean, is there anything else we can try right now?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Let me check one more thing. Can you look at the modem and tell me if there's an ethernet port that has a cable connected to it? A thinner cable?

Customer: No, there's no cable in those ports. Just the coaxial cable coming from the wall.

Agent: Okay. And you don't have another device you could plug in to test, do you? Like a computer or a laptop?

Customer: (pause) Um, no, not that I could hook up right now.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Michael, based on everything we've tried here, I think we need to get a technician out to your location. It could be a line issue, or it could be that the modem needs to be replaced, but at this point, we need someone onsite to diagnose it properly.

Customer: (frustrated) Okay... how soon can someone come out? I really need this fixed.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, longer pause) I'm looking at our schedule here, and the soonest I can get someone out is... tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow? That's... (sigh) ...I guess I don't have a choice. Do I?

Agent: I wish I could get someone sooner, Michael, I really do. But that's what we have available in your area. I'm going to set up that appointment for you, and I'll put a note on your account that we've done extensive troubleshooting and that you'll likely need a modem replacement or line repair.

Customer: Alright. Yeah, go ahead and set it up.

Agent: Perfect. So just to confirm—tomorrow, between 1 and 5 PM, at your address on Maple Street. And we have your phone number on file. The technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Okay, got it.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess not. I just... I really hope this gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I understand. I'm going to put a priority flag on this so the technician knows it's urgent. And if you think of anything else or the service miraculously comes back up, feel free to call us back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. We apologize for the inconvenience, and thank you for choosing Frontier Communications. Have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
