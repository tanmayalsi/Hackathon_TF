# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've got no idea what's going on. I need to get this fixed pretty quickly.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Thank you. And your name?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got your account here. I'm seeing you're on our Fiber 100 plan in the Westbrook area. So your internet's completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. No lights on the modem, no connection on my phone—I can't even see the WiFi network. It's just... dead.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let's start with the basics. Can you tell me where your modem is located and if you can see it right now?

Customer: It's in my home office, right on the desk. And yeah, I'm looking at it. The front panel is completely dark. No lights at all.

Agent: Got it. So there's no power indicator light. The first thing I'd like you to do is check if the power cable is securely plugged into the modem. Sometimes these cables can come loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm checking... yeah, no, it's definitely plugged in. The cable's tight.

Agent: Good. And is the power outlet itself working? Do you have anything else plugged into that same outlet you could test, like a lamp?

Customer: Um... (pause) Hold on. (rustling sounds) Yeah, I plugged in a lamp and it came right on. So the outlet's fine.

Agent: Excellent. That rules that out. Now let me check your account here for any service outages in your area. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing any reported outages in Westbrook at the moment. Let me ask you this—did anything happen before the internet went down? A storm, power surge, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. Actually, now that you mention it, there was a brief power flicker around midnight, but I thought my surge protector would've handled it. I didn't think much of it.

Agent: Ah, okay. That could definitely be related. Sometimes a power surge can affect the modem even with a surge protector. Let's try a power cycle. Can you unplug the modem from the power source?

Customer: Yeah, I'm unplugging it right now.

Agent: Good. Leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds. This will clear the modem's memory and hopefully reset whatever might have gotten corrupted.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been unplugged. Just... waiting here.

Agent: (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (plugging sounds) It's plugged back in. Now I'm just... waiting for it to boot up.

Agent: Yeah, give it a minute. You should see some lights start blinking on the front panel in a moment.

Customer: (pause) Um... nothing yet. Still completely dark.

Agent: Still nothing? Okay. Give it another 30 seconds or so. Sometimes it takes a minute.

Customer: (pause, longer) Okay, it's been about a minute now. The front panel is still completely dark. No lights whatsoever.

Agent: (pause) That's unusual. Let me check one more thing. Can you look at the back of the modem and verify what cables are connected? I want to make sure all the connections are secure.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I've got the power cable, the fiber optic cable coming in from the wall... those are both connected. They look fine.

Agent: Alright. And the fiber optic cable—is it making a clicking sound when you gently wiggle it?

Customer: (pause) Like a click? I'm not... I'm hearing like a tiny little connection sound, but it feels secure.

Agent: Okay. Here's what I think might be happening. It sounds like the modem itself may have been damaged by that power surge. The fact that there's absolutely no power indicator light at all suggests the power supply unit in the modem might have failed.

Customer: Oh no, really? So it's just... broken?

Agent: It's looking that way, unfortunately. But before we assume that, I want to try one more thing. Do you have another power cable we could try? Specifically a power cable from another device? Sometimes it's the cable itself.

Customer: Um, I've got an old printer in the closet. Would that work?

Agent: Possibly, yeah. Go ahead and grab that cable if you don't mind.

Customer: (pause, rustling sounds) Okay, I found it. I'm unplugging the modem cable and plugging in the printer cable now.

Agent: Great.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's plugged in. And... (longer pause) still nothing. Still no lights on the modem.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that tells me it's definitely the modem itself, not the power cable. The power supply has likely failed. I'm really sorry about this, David.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you guys send me a replacement or...?

Agent: Absolutely. We can definitely get a replacement modem shipped out to you. However, since this damage appears to be from a power surge rather than a defect with the equipment itself, there would typically be a replacement fee of $99.

Customer: A replacement fee? But I have surge protection. This wasn't my fault.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. The surge protector helps, but unfortunately power surges can still get through in some cases. Now, let me see if there's anything I can do here. (typing sounds) (pause) Give me just one moment to check with my supervisor on this. Can you hold for about a minute?

Customer: Yeah, I guess so.

Agent: Thank you, David. I'll be right back.

(hold music, approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Okay, David, I'm back. So I spoke with my supervisor and because you've been a loyal customer with us for, I see, about four years with a clean payment history, I can waive the replacement fee this time. We'll get a modem shipped out to you at no charge.

Customer: Oh, wow. Okay, well, thank you. I appreciate that. When can I expect it?

Agent: You're welcome! Let me see here. (typing sounds) With standard shipping, it should arrive within 5 to 7 business days. However, if you need it sooner, we do have expedited shipping available for an additional fee.

Customer: No, no, standard is fine. I can manage for a week.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to send you an email confirmation with tracking information as soon as we're off this call. When the modem arrives, it's actually very straightforward to set up. It's the same model you currently have, so it'll be a plug-and-play situation.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. And I should just unplug this one and replace it with the new one?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Just unplug everything from the current modem, unpack the new one, connect the power and the fiber cable, and it should boot right up. You should see lights within a minute or two.

Customer: Alright. And my account credentials and everything will still work?

Agent: Yes, everything will be the same. Your account will remain exactly as is. The new modem will automatically connect to our network.

Customer: Okay, great. Well, I appreciate your help, Marcus. And thanks for waiving that fee. I really do appreciate that.

Agent: You're very welcome, David. I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online immediately, but I'm glad we could get this resolved for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: You're all set. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye!
