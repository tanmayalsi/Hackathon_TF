# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now... and I'm showing that's under the name Michael Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you had any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine actually. I woke up, tried to work from home, and just... nothing. The router's on, the lights are blinking, but I can't get online.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the router is powered on and you're seeing lights on it. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. Can you tell me what color those lights are?

Customer: Um, there's a green light on the front, and then I see like a red light on one of the... I'm not sure which one it is. Hang on, let me look closer. (pause) Yeah, the red light is on the one that says, uh... "internet" or something?

Agent: Perfect. So green is good, but that red light on the internet port—that typically means there's no signal coming into your modem from our network. Have you tried unplugging the modem and letting it sit for a few minutes?

Customer: No, I haven't done that yet. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yes, that would be great. Go ahead and unplug it, and just let it sit for about two to three minutes. I'll be right here.

Customer: (background noise, unplugging) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Two to three minutes, you said?

Agent: Yep, two to three minutes should do it. While we're waiting, do you remember the last time everything was working normally?

Customer: Yeah, yesterday evening. I was watching Netflix and everything was fine. Then this morning I got up and tried to log into work and just... nothing.

Agent: Got it. And you haven't made any changes to your setup or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. I didn't touch anything.

Agent: Okay, good to know. (pause) Alright, should be about ready. Go ahead and plug that modem back in.

Customer: (unplugging sounds) Plugging it back in now. (pause) Okay, it's booting up. The lights are... they're flickering right now.

Agent: That's normal. It can take about a minute or so to fully boot up and connect. Just give it a second...

Customer: (pause) Okay, the green light is back on, but... (pause) the red light is still there.

Agent: Hmm, still showing that red light. Okay, let me check on our end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your modem here, and it appears to be online according to our system. That's a little odd. Let me just... (pause) okay, I'm not seeing any outages in your area or any issues with your account.

Customer: So what does that mean? Why isn't it working then?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. Let me try another step. Can you check your cables? The cable coming from outside into your modem—can you verify that it's plugged in all the way and not damaged?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. It looks okay to me. I mean, it's definitely plugged in.

Agent: And it's the coaxial cable, right? Kind of thick, has the metal connectors on the end?

Customer: Yes, that's the one.

Agent: Good. And I'm assuming you can see it from where you're at? There's no damage to it? No cracks or anything?

Customer: (pause) No, it looks fine. I don't see anything wrong with it.

Agent: Okay. Let me try cycling the modem one more time. Sometimes these things just need a full restart. So go ahead and unplug it again, and this time let's wait a full five minutes.

Customer: Really? Five minutes? I mean... okay, I guess so. (unplugging sounds) Unplugged.

Agent: And while we wait, let me just pull up your service status one more time. (typing sounds) So you're on a fiber connection, is that correct?

Customer: I think so? I'm not totally sure, to be honest.

Agent: It should say Frontier Fiber on your bill or something might be written on your modem. But either way, let me just... (pause) (typing sounds) I'm checking the fiber line status for your address and... hmm, I'm not seeing any obvious issues on my end. The connection's showing as active.

Customer: That doesn't make sense. If it's active, why can't I get online?

Agent: I know, it's frustrating. There could be an issue with the modem itself, or there might be something with the signal that's not showing up in our system yet. How much longer on that five minutes?

Customer: Um, I'd say about... another minute or so?

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in when you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it in now. (pause) Lights are flickering again. (long pause) Green light's on. And... (pause) the red light is still there.

Agent: Still the red light. Okay, I hate to say this, but it seems like there might be a hardware issue with your modem, or there could be something on the line side that's not registering in our system. I think at this point we're going to need to get a technician out to your location to take a look.

Customer: A technician? How long is that going to take? I need internet for work. I've got calls scheduled this afternoon.

Agent: I completely understand. (typing sounds) Let me see what I can get scheduled for you. What does your schedule look like? Are you available today?

Customer: Maybe later? Like, after three or four o'clock?

Agent: Let me check availability... (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm showing we have a technician available around 4 PM this afternoon. Would that work for you?

Customer: I... yeah, I guess that'll have to work. What if they can't fix it?

Agent: Well, most of the time when we get a tech out there, they can identify the issue pretty quickly. If it's your modem, we can swap that out. If it's something with the line, they can take care of that too. But I can't make any promises without them looking at it first.

Customer: Alright, fine. How does this work? Do I need to stay home?

Agent: Yes, you'll need to be there to let them in. The technician should arrive sometime between 4 and 6 PM. They'll call you about 30 minutes before they show up, so you'll get a heads up. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here. Can you just... like, confirm all this in my email or something?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to send a confirmation email to the address on your account with the appointment details and a reference number. You should get that within the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today, Michael?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Hopefully your guy can figure this out.

Agent: I'm sure they will. And if they can't get it resolved today for some reason, or if you have any other issues, don't hesitate to give us a call back. We appreciate your business, and I apologize that we couldn't get this fixed over the phone.

Customer: Alright. Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
