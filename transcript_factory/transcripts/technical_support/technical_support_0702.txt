# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went out completely about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I'm working from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll see what we can do. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the name on the account?

Customer: Michael Brennan.

Agent: Perfect, thank you Michael. I've got you here. So you're saying your internet is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, it's completely down. Like, nothing's working. My router's not even showing any lights or anything.

Agent: Alright, so the router lights are all off. That's actually a good place to start. Um, let's try a basic power reset first. Can you locate your router for me? It should be a white box, probably has some ports on the back...

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's on the shelf next to my TV.

Agent: Great. Okay, so what I want you to do is unplug the power cable from the back of the router. Just... pull it right out.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds. This gives it a chance to fully power down and reset.

Customer: Alright, I'm waiting. (pause) ...Still waiting.

Agent: So while we're doing that, let me ask—did anything happen before the internet went out? Like, did you have any storms in your area or any power outages?

Customer: Actually, yeah. We had a pretty bad storm roll through about two hours ago. The power flickered a couple times but it came back on pretty quickly.

Agent: That could definitely be it. Power surges can sometimes impact the modem and router. Okay, go ahead and plug the router back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in. Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Good. Now we're going to give it about two to three minutes to fully boot back up. While it's starting, you should see some lights come on. Do you see any lights starting to appear?

Customer: Um... (pause) I see one light. It's like amber or orange colored?

Agent: That's normal. That means it's booting up. Just give it another minute or so and you should see more lights come on—usually a green one for internet connection.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I'm looking at it. I see the orange light is still there but I don't see any other lights coming on. How long should this take?

Agent: It shouldn't take more than about three minutes total. Let's give it just a little bit longer. (pause) Is the orange light blinking or is it solid?

Customer: It's blinking. It's blinking pretty slowly.

Agent: Okay, the blinking is actually... hmm. That usually indicates it's still initializing, but after five minutes or so it should stabilize. Let me check something on my end really quick. (typing sounds) I'm just going to run a line test to see if there's any signal coming into your address.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm not seeing any signal coming into your line right now. That could mean a few things. It could be an issue with our network in your area, or it could be something with the line itself coming into your home. Um, how are your lights looking now?

Customer: Still just the orange one. It's still blinking.

Agent: Still just the one? Okay. Well, let me try one more thing before we dig into this further. Do you have a modem separate from your router? Sometimes they're in the same box, but sometimes they're separate devices.

Customer: Oh, uh... I think they're both in the same unit? I'm not totally sure. It just says Frontier on it.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So we've got the combined unit. Alright, let me try having you do a factory reset. Now, this is a little different from just unplugging it. There should be a small reset button on the back. It might be recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something to press it.

Customer: Let me look. (pause) Yeah, I see a little button. There's a small hole here on the back.

Agent: That's it. Go ahead and grab a paperclip and while the device is powered on, hold that reset button down for about 10 to 15 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing it now. I'm pressing the button... (pause) It's still in there. How long?

Agent: Just keep holding it. Should be coming up to about 15 seconds here...

Customer: Okay. (pause) It's been like 20 seconds. Can I let go?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and let go.

Customer: I let go. The light just went out completely now.

Agent: That's actually normal. It's doing a hard reset. Give it a couple minutes and it should boot back up fresh. This might take a bit longer than before, maybe up to five minutes.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'll wait. (pause) ...Still nothing. Just darkness.

Agent: [inaudible] should be on soon. While we're waiting, let me just... (typing sounds) Let me make a note here that we're attempting troubleshooting and also escalate this to our technical team. I want to check if there's maybe a service outage in your area that I'm not seeing.

Customer: Is there an outage?

Agent: Not that I can see in our system, but sometimes it takes a few minutes to update. Let me put you on a very brief hold while I check with my supervisor about your area. It'll just be like 30 seconds.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) (30 seconds) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I'm not seeing any outages reported. Um, at this point I'm thinking we might have an issue with the equipment itself, or possibly a line issue coming from the street into your house. Are you seeing any lights now on the device?

Customer: No, still nothing. It's been like... three or four minutes now and still completely dark.

Agent: Hmm, that's concerning. Okay, so that usually would have come back by now. This is suggesting to me that maybe the equipment took some damage during that power surge from the storm. Um, I hate to tell you this, but I think we're going to need to get a technician out to your place to diagnose what's going on.

Customer: Really? How long is that going to take? I need my internet back today if possible.

Agent: I totally understand. Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) (pause) So we have some same-day appointments available, but the earliest time slot I'm seeing is between 4 and 6 PM today. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine. I can make that work.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, there will be a $99 service call fee if it turns out to be an equipment issue. If it's something on the line side or our side of things, that fee would be waived. But I wanted to let you know upfront.

Customer: Okay, I understand.

Agent: Alright, so let me get that scheduled for you. I'm going to set up a technician visit for today between 4 and 6 PM. Can I get a callback number to confirm?

Customer: It's the same number as the account, 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. You should get a text and email confirmation within the next few minutes with all the details and the technician's information. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Hopefully the tech can get me back up and running.

Agent: Yeah, we'll get you sorted out. I'm sorry you're dealing with this today, especially with the storm and everything. Our technician will take great care of you. Thanks so much for calling Frontier, Michael.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. Appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
