Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the router and everything.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. So the internet went out about an hour ago, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, like an hour and fifteen minutes ago now. One second I was working from home and then just... nothing. No lights on the modem or anything.

Agent: Okay, and you mentioned you already tried unplugging the router. Have you also tried unplugging the modem? Sometimes they need to be power cycled together.

Customer: The modem too? No, I didn't try that yet. Let me... (sounds of movement) okay, unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and unplug the modem and while we wait, let me ask—are you in an area that had any storms recently? Sometimes power surges can affect the equipment.

Customer: Hmm, not that I noticed. It was pretty clear this morning. Maybe something yesterday but nothing major.

Agent: Alright. And how long has it been since you unplugged it?

Customer: About thirty seconds?

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in now and let's wait a minute or two for it to boot back up. While that's happening, can you tell me if you see any lights on the front of the modem now?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm plugging it back in... (pause) Nothing yet. Still dark.

Agent: That's normal. Give it about another thirty seconds. Sometimes the modem takes a bit to power on.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I'm... I'm looking at it. Still nothing. This is weird.

Agent: Hmm. Alright, and the modem is definitely fully plugged in? Sometimes the cord can come loose.

Customer: Yeah, it's in pretty tight. I mean... (pause) wait, let me check the back. (pause) No, it's definitely plugged in. But there's like, no lights at all. Not even a power light.

Agent: Okay, that might indicate a power issue. Is there a power outlet nearby that you could try plugging the modem into instead?

Customer: Um, yeah, there's one on the other side of my desk. Let me unplug it and move it over. (pause) Okay, plugging it in to this outlet... (pause) Still nothing, man. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, which is good news. But I am going to check your line status... (pause) Okay, so on my end, I'm actually not seeing your modem connect to our network at all right now.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is there something wrong with the modem?

Agent: It could be a few things. The modem might have had a hardware failure, which happens sometimes. But before we go down that road, let me ask—do you have any other outlets you could try? Maybe one closer to where the ONT is installed? That's the box that connects to the fiber line coming into your house.

Customer: The ONT? I don't... I'm not sure where that is exactly.

Agent: That's okay. It's typically a small white or black box, usually mounted on the outside of your house or in a utility closet. Do you know where your fiber line enters your home?

Customer: Oh, um, I think I might know. There's a box mounted on the side of the garage. Is that it?

Agent: That very well could be. Can you go take a look at it? See if there are any lights on it?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, heading out there now. (background noise, door closing) Alright, so I'm looking at it. There's like... a bunch of lights but they're not all the same color. Most of them are orange.

Agent: Okay, that's actually not what we want to see. Ideally, they should be green or blue. The fact that they're orange indicates there might be an issue with the connection. Are any of them green?

Customer: Um... no, I don't think so. Pretty much all orange. Maybe one is... no, all orange.

Agent: Alright. Can you see if there's a power cable connected to the ONT?

Customer: Yeah, it's plugged in over here. Looks like it's definitely connected.

Agent: Okay, and I need you to look for a small recessed button on the front of the ONT. It's usually red or white. Do you see anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see a red button. It's like, recessed in.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to have you press and hold that button for about ten seconds. This will reset the ONT.

Customer: Okay, pressing it... (pause) ...still pressing... (pause) How long did you say?

Agent: Ten seconds. You're doing good.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let go?

Agent: Go ahead and release it now. Let's wait a minute for it to reboot.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Waiting. Anything happening on your end?

Agent: (typing sounds) Not yet. Give it another thirty seconds or so.

Customer: (longer pause) So... still nothing on my end. The lights are still all orange.

Agent: Still orange? (pause) Unfortunately, that's unusual. Typically after a reset, you'd see the lights change within a minute. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check with my supervisor on this. It should just be a moment.

Customer: Yeah, okay. (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Thanks for holding. I've checked and unfortunately, it sounds like there might be a hardware issue with your ONT. The fact that it's not responding to a reset and the lights are staying solid orange suggests it may have failed.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, can you fix it?

Agent: So the good news is that the ONT is our equipment, so we can replace it at no charge to you. However, I do need to let you know that to get a technician out to your home to install the new equipment, we're looking at an appointment window of about 4 to 5 business days from now.

Customer: Four to five days? That's... I work from home. I need internet.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry about that. Let me see if there's anything else I can troubleshoot before we go that route. Can you double-check the fiber line itself? Is the fiber optic cable connected securely to the ONT?

Customer: (pause) Uh, I'm not sure which one that is. There's a lot of cables back here.

Agent: It should be a thin cable, maybe about as thick as a pencil, and it's usually a bright color like orange or yellow.

Customer: (pause) I see something orange. It looks pretty small and thin. Like, really thin.

Agent: That's likely it. Can you make sure it's firmly seated in the port? Sometimes they can come loose.

Customer: (pause) I'm... I'm pushing on it. It feels pretty solid already but I'm giving it a good push. (pause) It's not budging.

Agent: Okay, that's good. And I'm still not seeing your modem connecting on my end either. (pause) Unfortunately, at this point, I think we're looking at the ONT being the issue. Do you want to go ahead and schedule that technician appointment?

Customer: How soon can they actually come out? Like, is there any way to get someone sooner?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check if we have any priority appointments... Unfortunately, no. The soonest I'm seeing is Wednesday of next week. It's a 9 AM to 1 PM window.

Customer: That's still like, four days away. Isn't there anything else?

Agent: I really wish I had better options for you. The only other thing I could suggest is if you have a mobile hotspot from your phone, that might be a workaround in the meantime.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) Yeah, I guess that'll have to work. Okay, go ahead and schedule the appointment.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that set up for you. Can I confirm the best number to reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: Excellent. So I have you down for a technician visit on Wednesday, next week, between 9 AM and 1 PM. The technician will replace your ONT and we should have your internet back up and running at that time. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. We appreciate your patience, and we look forward to getting you back online. Have a great day.

Customer: Yeah, you too.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
