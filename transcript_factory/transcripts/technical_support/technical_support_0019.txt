Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out completely about an hour ago, and I can't get it back up. I've tried restarting the modem a couple times, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what name is on the account?

Customer: It's under Michael Torres.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got you here. So you mentioned you've already restarted the modem—that's great. When you did that, did you see any lights on the modem come back on after it powered back up?

Customer: Uh, yeah. I mean, the power light comes on, but... I think the internet light is just staying red. Or maybe it's orange? I'm not great with these things.

Agent: No problem at all. That's actually really helpful information. So if that light isn't green, that usually means the modem isn't connecting to our network. Before we go further, let me just check our systems here to see if there are any outages in your area. (pause) (typing sounds) What's your address, Michael?

Customer: It's 2847 Maple Drive in Springfield.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Springfield... and I'm not showing any outages in your area right now, so that's good news. That usually means it's something we can fix. Let me ask you—when you look at your modem, is it plugged in directly to a power outlet?

Customer: Yeah, it's plugged into the wall.

Agent: Good. And the cable cord—the one that comes from the wall into the modem—is that connected securely?

Customer: (pause) Um... let me look. (background noise of movement) Yeah, looks pretty plugged in to me.

Agent: Alright. Now, I want you to do something for me. Can you unplug the modem from the power outlet completely?

Customer: Okay... (sounds of unplugging) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds just to let all the power drain out of it completely.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been... yeah, it's been about thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (plugging sounds) Alright, it's plugging back in now. The lights are... okay, the power light's on. I'm waiting for the other lights to come on... (pause) ...and... no, same thing. The orange light is just staying there.

Agent: Okay, and do you see any other lights changing at all? Sometimes there's like a little blinking light that indicates data transfer?

Customer: No, nothing's blinking. Just the power light and then that other one that's staying orange.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Let me check something on our end here. (typing sounds) Michael, how long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, um, about two years now, I think?

Agent: Great, thanks. So I'm looking at your account and everything looks active on our side. No issues there. Let me try a different approach. Are you on a computer right now that you could try to connect to?

Customer: I mean, I'm on my phone, but I can't connect to my WiFi. It's not showing up.

Agent: Right, right. That makes sense if the modem isn't connecting properly. Um, do you have a laptop or desktop computer nearby that you could use just to test?

Customer: I've got a laptop. Why?

Agent: I want to see if we can do a wired connection—so if you plug an ethernet cable directly from the modem into your computer, that sometimes bypasses some connectivity issues we see with WiFi.

Customer: (pause) I... I don't think I have an ethernet cable. We've always just used WiFi.

Agent: That's totally fine. Most people do nowadays. Um... (pause) Okay, let me try something else. On the back of your modem, Michael, there should be a small reset button. It's usually recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something thin to press it.

Customer: Oh, no, no—I don't want to do a full reset. Won't that delete everything?

Agent: That's actually a good question. A reset on the modem would just restore it to factory settings, so it would just be like starting fresh with your internet connection. We'd have to re-authenticate everything with our network anyway, but it wouldn't affect anything on your computer or phone. It's really just the modem itself.

Customer: (hesitant) ...Okay, I guess I could try that. (background noise) Let me find something small... (more background noise) I got a pen, is that okay? Actually, a paperclip would be better. (pause) Okay, I found one. So I'm just... pushing it in?

Agent: Yeah, just hold it in for about ten seconds. You should see the lights on the modem go dark and then come back on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it in... (pause) ...the lights just went off. Now I'm waiting... (pause) ...and they're coming back on. The power light... okay, it's back. And... (longer pause) ...no, same thing. Still just that orange light.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Um. (typing sounds) Let me check on something. Michael, when was the last time your internet was working normally?

Customer: It was this morning, maybe around 9 AM? I was working from home and everything was fine, and then right around lunchtime it just dropped.

Agent: Alright. And you haven't had any storms or anything like that this morning, right?

Customer: No, it's actually pretty nice out. No rain or anything.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I'm going to be honest with you, Michael. Based on what we're seeing—the modem powering on but not connecting, the reset not helping, and no outages on our end—there's a possibility that there's an issue with the modem itself or the connection between the modem and our network that I can't fully diagnose from here over the phone.

Customer: (disappointed) Oh... so what does that mean?

Agent: Well, we have a couple of options. One would be to get a technician out to your place to take a look at the physical setup—check the cables, the connection points outside your home, maybe test the modem with diagnostic equipment. Or, if the modem is still under warranty, we could send you a replacement unit.

Customer: How long would it take to get a technician out here?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. (pause) Looks like our earliest appointment would be... tomorrow afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess that would work. Tomorrow afternoon is fine.

Agent: Great. Before we schedule that, let me just try one more thing. Sometimes we can push an update or signal to the modem from our end that can help. Give me just one second here. (pause) (typing sounds) (longer pause) Okay, Michael, can you look at your modem and tell me if any of the lights have changed?

Customer: (pause) No... no, still the same.

Agent: Alright. I think at this point, getting a technician out is probably your best bet. Let me go ahead and schedule that for you. So that's tomorrow, [inaudible]... between 1 and 5 PM at 2847 Maple Drive. Is that address still correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And the best number to reach you on is the 555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's my cell phone.

Agent: Excellent. So Michael, I'm going to get this scheduled, and you should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes. The technician will give you a call about 30 minutes before they arrive so you know roughly when to expect them.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. Is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: You know what, you can leave the modem plugged in and powered on. Just in case our system does push anything through, we want it to be ready to receive that. But based on what we've troubleshot today, I wouldn't expect the internet to come back on its own before tomorrow. 

Customer: Alright, I appreciate your help anyway.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved for you today, Michael, but I'm confident our technician will be able to figure out what's going on. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
