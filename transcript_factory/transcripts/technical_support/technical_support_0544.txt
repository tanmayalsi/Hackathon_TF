Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I've got calls I need to make for work and it's pretty frustrating.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I totally understand how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's 555-0147. The phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. And your name?

Customer: Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. Thanks for that. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage this morning, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. Nothing. I tried unplugging the router, plugging it back in, the whole thing. Nothing's working.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on the restart. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) Great, I've got you. And just to confirm, you're in the Scottsdale area, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So let's walk through a few things. When you say the internet's completely down, are you seeing any lights on the modem at all? Like, is the modem powered on?

Customer: Oh, yeah. The modem's on. There are lights. Let me see... there's a green light and like a red light that's... (trailing off) ...blinking?

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing a green light and a red blinking light. Can you tell me which lights those are? Like, are they labeled, or can you describe where they are on the modem?

Customer: Uh, there's like a power light, I think that's green. And then there's one that says... (pause) ...I'm looking at it now... it says "Internet" and that one's red and blinking.

Agent: Perfect, that's actually really helpful. That red blinking light on the Internet indicator typically means the modem isn't connecting to our network. Let me check if there are any service issues in your area first. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end in Scottsdale right now, so it's probably something we can fix on your end.

Customer: Alright, so what do I need to do?

Agent: So here's what I'd like you to try. Can you go ahead and unplug the modem? I know you mentioned you already restarted it, but this time we're going to do a full factory reset. Go ahead and unplug it, and then wait about... let's say two minutes.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. I'm gonna set a timer.

Agent: Good idea. While we wait, Michael, is your modem directly connected to the wall outlet, or is it going through a power strip?

Customer: It's on a power strip.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. And is anything else plugged into that power strip that might be interfering?

Customer: No, just the modem and like, a lamp. But the lamp's off.

Agent: That's good. (pause) While we're waiting, have you noticed any issues with the service before this, or is this the first time something like this has happened?

Customer: No, it's been pretty solid usually. I mean, maybe a little slow sometimes in the evenings, but nothing like this.

Agent: Understood. Okay, has it been about two minutes?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, pretty much. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and plug it back in. This time we're gonna let it boot up completely. It might take a few minutes for all the lights to stabilize.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, it's plugged back in. The power light came back on immediately.

Agent: Good. Now just give it a minute or two. We want to see if that Internet light changes from red to green or blue.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... (pause) ...nope, still red. Still blinking red.

Agent: Alright, still blinking red. That's okay, we've got a few more things we can try. Can you check the cable that runs from the wall to your modem? Is it plugged in securely on both ends?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, I'm checking it now. Looks pretty secure to me.

Agent: Okay, and you're not seeing any damage to the cable or anything?

Customer: No, it looks fine.

Agent: Good. Let me try something else here. (typing sounds) I'm going to send a refresh signal to your modem. It should only take a minute.

Customer: Okay, sending a signal. (pause) How do I know if it worked?

Agent: Well, the modem might restart on its own. You might see the lights flicker or reset. Just keep an eye on that Internet light and see if it changes colors.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. (long pause) ...Nothing's changing. Still red.

Agent: Still red, okay. (pause) Michael, I'm thinking there might be a signal issue coming from our line or possibly an issue with the modem itself. What model modem do you have? It should be labeled somewhere on the device.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it says... Frontier... FX-100. Is that right?

Agent: FX-100. Perfect, I've got that. Those are solid modems. (typing sounds) Alright, so at this point I've tried the standard troubleshooting. Let me try connecting to your modem remotely to see if I can get more diagnostic information. (pause) Can you tell me if there's a label on the back or bottom that has a serial number?

Customer: Yeah, there's a lot of numbers back here. Which one do you need?

Agent: The serial number should be... it'll probably say "SN" or "Serial Number" right next to it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I see it. It's 4-7-9-2-8-K-X-9-4-1-2.

Agent: (typing sounds) 4-7-9-2-8-K-X-9-4-1-2. Got it. (pause) One moment while I pull that up. (pause, longer hold) Okay, so I'm attempting to remotely connect and... (pause) I'm not able to establish a connection. That tells me the modem is definitely not communicating with our network currently.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: (pause) Well, it could be a few things. It could be an issue with the signal coming from the street, or it could be an issue with the modem's internal components. Unfortunately, given that I'm not able to establish a remote connection and we've gone through the standard troubleshooting steps, I'm not going to be able to resolve this over the phone.

Customer: Oh man. So what do I do?

Agent: So here's what I can do for you. I can schedule a technician to come out and take a look at both the modem and check the line coming into your home. They'll be able to do some on-site diagnostics that I can't do from here.

Customer: Okay, how long would that take?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) We have an opening tomorrow between 12 PM and 4 PM, or we have another slot on Thursday morning between 8 AM and 12 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow would be better if I can. I really need to get this working.

Agent: Absolutely. I'll get you scheduled for tomorrow between 12 and 4. There will be no service call fee since this is our first troubleshooting attempt. (typing sounds) Perfect. You're all set for tomorrow, Michael. Is the number we have on file, 555-0147, the best way to reach you if the technician needs to contact you?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell, so yeah, that works.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation email shortly, and the technician will typically call about 30 minutes before they arrive. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I'm confident they'll get you up and running. I apologize you're dealing with this, Michael. We appreciate your patience, and thanks for being a Frontier customer.

Customer: Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
