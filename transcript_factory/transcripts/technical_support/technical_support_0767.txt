Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet just completely stopped working about an hour ago and I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that now. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Riverside area. And you're saying the internet just went down?

Customer: Yeah, like an hour ago maybe? I was just working from home and suddenly everything stopped. No internet at all.

Agent: Alright, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me—do you see any lights on your modem right now? There should be a box, probably white or black, with some LED lights on the front.

Customer: Um, yeah, I'm looking at it now. I see... okay, so there's a power light that's on, it's green. But the internet light, I think it's the one next to it, that one's red.

Agent: Okay, red is definitely not what we want to see. That usually indicates a connection issue. Let's try power cycling the modem. Can you unplug it from the power outlet for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, doing it now.

Agent: Great. Let's wait about thirty seconds and then plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) ...alright, it's back in. (pause) The lights are booting up now.

Agent: Perfect. While that's happening, can I ask—have there been any recent storms in your area? Any power outages or anything like that?

Customer: No, actually it's been pretty nice out all day. Clear skies. Nothing like that.

Agent: (pause) Okay, good to know. How's it looking now? Is that internet light coming on?

Customer: Uh... (pause) ...no. It's still red. Maybe even more red than before? Is that... is that normal?

Agent: No, that's not normal. That's telling me the modem isn't establishing a connection with our network. Let me check if there are any outages in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm not showing any outages on our end. Have you noticed any physical damage to the fiber line coming into your home? Any loose cables or anything outside?

Customer: No, I mean, I haven't really looked. Where would that be?

Agent: Usually it comes in near your foundation or along the side of your house. There should be a small box—we call it an ONT box—that the fiber line connects to. But if you're not comfortable checking that, we can definitely help with that.

Customer: No, no, I'll look. Hold on a second.

Agent: Sure thing, take your time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at the side of my house. I see a small white box here. Everything looks... I don't know, it looks okay to me? The cable seems plugged in and everything.

Agent: Alright, good. Can you check if there are any lights on that box? The ONT box should have some indicator lights as well.

Customer: Yeah, there are lights. Let me see... I've got a green light and then... oh, there's a red light too. Same as the modem.

Agent: Okay, so that's definitely pointing to a connection issue between the network and your equipment. Let me try something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm going to send a refresh signal to your modem. Give it just a moment.

Customer: (pause) Okay...

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, I've sent that through. Can you check those lights again? Any change?

Customer: (pause) No... still the same. Red light's still there.

Agent: Hmm. Let me try resetting the modem completely. I want you to hold down the small reset button on the back of the modem for about fifteen seconds. You might need a paperclip or a pen to reach it.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause) I found it. (pause) Pushing it now. (pause) Okay, I'm holding it. (pause) One... two... three... (pause) Still holding... (pause) Okay, fifteen seconds should be up.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about a minute for it to fully restart and reconfigure itself.

Customer: (pause) This is frustrating. I really need this for work.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll get you back up and running. (pause) How's it looking now?

Customer: (pause) Um... (pause) ...nope. Still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let me think about this for a second. (typing sounds) You know what, let me put you on a very brief hold while I reach out to our network team to see if there's something happening on the backend that I'm not seeing in our system. It'll just be a moment.

Customer: Sure, okay.

Agent: (hold music for 45 seconds) Thank you for holding. I spoke with our network team, and they're not showing any connectivity on your line at all. This could be a few things—it could be a break in the fiber line somewhere between our distribution point and your home, or it could be an issue with your ONT box itself. Unfortunately, that's something we'd need to send a technician out to diagnose properly.

Customer: You're kidding. So you can't fix this over the phone?

Agent: I wish I could. We've exhausted the standard troubleshooting steps, and at this point it's a hardware or infrastructure issue that requires a physical inspection. I'm really sorry about that.

Customer: (pause) Okay... when can someone come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability for you. (typing sounds) (pause) We have an opening tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I guess that'll have to work. This is really not ideal though.

Agent: I completely get it, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I'm going to get you scheduled with our technician. Your appointment number is 44827. A technician will be at your home sometime between 1 and 5 PM tomorrow. Is there a number where we can reach you if they need to reschedule or confirm?

Customer: Yeah, it's the same number on the account.

Agent: Perfect. I've got that down. You should also receive a confirmation text message shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess not. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone. I really do appreciate your patience, and our technician will take great care of you tomorrow. Thank you for calling Frontier, and have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
