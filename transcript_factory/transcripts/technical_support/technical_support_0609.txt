Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick and we'll get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Okay, I'm looking at your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Cedar Rapids area. And when you say the internet's down, you mean you're not getting any connection at all?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. Like, the modem's on—I can see the lights—but there's just no connection. My laptop can see the WiFi network but it won't actually connect to anything.

Agent: Okay, that's really helpful information. So the modem is powered on, you can see the WiFi network, but the connection isn't working. Let me ask you a few things. Can you tell me what color the lights are on your modem right now?

Customer: Uh, let me look... (pause) So the power light is green. There's a green light. And then there's like, I don't know, a couple other lights but they're not lit up? Like, they're off or red or something.

Agent: Okay, so we want to see a green light on the power and ideally we want to see lights on the internet or WiFi indicators. Can you describe the other lights for me? Are any of them blinking or solid?

Customer: (pause) They look... they look red? I think? Honestly, I'm not that tech-savvy with this stuff. But nothing's blinking. It all just looks kind of dead.

Agent: That's alright, I can help you with this. The red lights typically indicate there's an issue with the connection. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cord out.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about 30 seconds. Just give it a moment to fully power down.

Customer: (pause) Alright, how long was that?

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait for it to boot back up. This usually takes a couple of minutes. While we're waiting, can you tell me if you've experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, nothing like this before. It was working fine last night. I went to bed, woke up this morning, and just... nothing.

Agent: (pause) Okay, and did you notice anything unusual last night? Any storms in your area, or power outages?

Customer: Now that you mention it, yeah, actually. We had pretty bad weather come through last night. Lightning and everything. Could that be it?

Agent: It definitely could be. Weather events can sometimes cause issues. Let me check our system here... (typing sounds) I'm not showing any active outages in your area right now, but let's see if the modem is back up and running. Are you seeing any lights on it now?

Customer: Yeah, actually. The green light's solid again, and I'm seeing... I think there's a white light now on one of the other ones?

Agent: Okay, that's good. That's progress. Let's see if you can connect to the WiFi now. Can you try connecting on one of your devices?

Customer: (pause) Let me grab my phone here... (pause) Okay, the network is showing up. (pause) I'm entering my password... (pause) Hmm, it's not connecting. It's just saying "can't connect to this network."

Agent: Alright, let's try a couple more things. Sometimes the WiFi settings need to be reset. Are you comfortable accessing your modem's admin panel?

Customer: Uh... I don't know. How would I even do that?

Agent: No problem. You'd open a web browser and go to a specific IP address. But actually, let me try something else first. Can you try restarting your phone? Just power it off and back on?

Customer: Sure thing. (pause) Okay, powering it down... (pause) Alright, it's back up. (pause) Trying again... (pause) No, still nothing. Still getting that same error.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm, okay. Let me check a few things on my end. (pause) I'm going to check the line status here... (pause) That's... that's odd.

Customer: What? What's odd?

Agent: Well, I'm showing there might be a signal issue coming into your location. It could be related to that weather event you mentioned. The lightning may have affected the line or the connection point.

Customer: Oh no. So what does that mean? How do we fix it?

Agent: Well, typically for something like that, we'd need to send a technician out to check the outside lines and make sure everything's properly connected. But before I schedule that, let me try one more thing. Can you check—is there an ONT box somewhere in your home? It might be mounted on a wall or in a closet. It's usually a small white or gray box about the size of a large paperback book.

Customer: (pause) Let me look... (pause) Oh, yeah! I think I see it. In the hallway closet. It's got some green lights on it.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, can you check if there are any loose cables connected to it? Sometimes they can come unplugged.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking... No, everything looks pretty tight. All the cables seem connected.

Agent: Alright. I've gone through the main troubleshooting steps here, and it looks like the issue is likely on the line side. This would require a technician to come out and inspect the external lines and connections.

Customer: Okay... so how long would that take? I really need this working for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) The soonest we have a technician in your area is tomorrow between 1 PM and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Seriously? Isn't there anything sooner? I have calls I need to make today.

Agent: I wish I could get someone out sooner. Unfortunately, due to the weather last night, we had quite a few service calls and our technicians are pretty booked up. Tomorrow is the earliest availability.

Customer: This is... this is really frustrating. Can't you like, walk me through anything else to try right now?

Agent: (pause) I hear you, and I'm sorry. Unfortunately, based on what we're seeing in the system and the troubleshooting we've done, the issue is outside your home and that does require a technician to diagnose and repair. I don't want to have you trying things that won't resolve the root cause, especially since we're pretty confident about where the problem is.

Customer: Yeah, I guess you're right. So tomorrow then. What do I need to do?

Agent: So I'm going to schedule that appointment for you tomorrow, 1 PM to 5 PM. You'll get a confirmation call the day before. A technician will come out, check the lines from the street to your home, and get everything back up and running.

Customer: Alright. Will there be a charge for this?

Agent: Given that the issue appears to be weather-related and on our infrastructure, there shouldn't be a service call charge. We'll just want to get this fixed for you.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. Is there anything else I should try in the meantime?

Agent: You can try restarting the modem one more time if you'd like, but honestly, I don't expect the connection to come back online until the technician gets the external lines repaired. Just keep the modem powered on so they can test it when they arrive.

Customer: Yeah, I'll just leave it as is then.

Agent: Sounds good. So to confirm, we have you scheduled for tomorrow between 1 PM and 5 PM. Is there a cell phone number where we can reach you if the technician needs to get in touch?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147, same number on the account.

Agent: Perfect. I have that down. I'm sorry we weren't able to get you back online immediately, but we'll get this resolved tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, anyway.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
