# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: It's... uh... 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. Account for James Martinez at 412 Oakwood Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Well, yeah, I mean... there are some lights, but I'm not really sure what they're supposed to look like. The modem's got a few lights on it, but nothing seems normal, I guess?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Let me walk you through this. Can you look at your modem right now and tell me what color the lights are?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it. There's like... a red light on the left side that's blinking, and then there's some other lights that are off, I think.

Agent: Alright, a red blinking light typically means there's a connectivity issue. That's actually pretty common. Have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and do that for me. Just unplug it, wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. I'll wait on the line.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, I'm waiting... thirty seconds, you said?

Agent: Yep, about thirty seconds should do it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Great. While that boots back up, let me ask—do you have a separate router or is it a combo unit?

Customer: I think it's... separate? There's the modem and then there's like a white box next to it.

Agent: Perfect, that white box is your router. Okay, give the modem about two minutes to fully restart. You should see the red light go away and some green lights come on. Are we seeing that?

Customer: (pause) Um... not yet. Still mostly the same. Red light's still blinking, and the other lights are still... dark, I guess.

Agent: Okay, let's try the router as well. Go ahead and unplug that white box too, wait thirty seconds, and plug it back in.

Customer: Alright. (pause) Unplugged. (pause) And... (pause) plugging back in. The lights on it just came back on, so that's something.

Agent: Good, that's good. Now let's give everything a moment to sync back up. Can you check your phone or a device and see if you're able to connect to the WiFi network or get a connection?

Customer: Yeah, let me grab my phone. (pause) Uh... okay, I'm looking at available networks and I can see "Frontier" listed, but when I try to connect... it's just saying "can't connect to network." So that's not working.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check a few things on my end here. (typing sounds) One second... (pause) Alright, I'm showing that your modem is not communicating with our network right now. That red light on the modem is actually indicating that it's not able to establish a connection to our system.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like... is something broken?

Agent: It could be a few things. It might be a service outage in your area, it could be an issue with your line, or there could be something with the equipment. Let me check for any outages first. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm not showing any outages reported in your area at this time.

Customer: Okay, so it's not that then.

Agent: Right. So here's what I'd like to try next. I'm going to send a signal to your modem remotely to see if I can get it to resync with our network. This should take just a minute or so.

Customer: Okay, yeah, do whatever you need to do.

Agent: (pause) Alright, sending that now. (pause) Can you watch that modem and let me know if you see any changes to the lights?

Customer: (pause) Umm... nothing's really changing. Still got the red blinking light.

Agent: (pause) Still red, okay. Let me try one more thing here. Sometimes the line itself can have issues. Can you check to make sure all the cables coming into your modem are plugged in all the way? There should be a cable coming from the wall.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see a cable coming from the wall. It looks... plugged in? The connection seems pretty tight.

Agent: Okay. And there's nothing unplugged or loose that you can see?

Customer: No, I mean, I'm looking at it and it seems fine to me. It's plugged into the modem on one end and the wall on the other.

Agent: Alright, let me check something else. (typing sounds) I'm looking at the line diagnostics here and... hmm, I'm actually not seeing a strong signal coming from the line to your location. That could indicate that there's a problem with the line itself or somewhere between here and your house.

Customer: So what does that mean? What do I do about that?

Agent: Well, unfortunately this might be something that requires a technician to come out and check the line physically. It could be anything from a damaged line outside to a connection issue at the node. I'd need to schedule a service call for you.

Customer: A service call? How long would that take? I need my internet.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what appointments we have available. (typing sounds) What does your schedule look like? We have some availability tomorrow afternoon between 12 and 4 PM, or we could potentially fit you in the day after that in the morning.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon works, I guess. But that means I'm without internet tonight?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. Based on what I'm seeing here, this appears to be a line-side issue that I'm not able to resolve remotely. The technician will be able to diagnose it properly and get it fixed.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, I guess that's... fine. What time tomorrow?

Agent: Let me go ahead and set you up for tomorrow, the 15th, between 12 and 4 PM. A technician will arrive during that window. Can I get a callback number to confirm the appointment?

Customer: It's the same number on my account, 555-0147. Actually, no, my cell is better—it's 555-0198.

Agent: Perfect, I've got that down. So just to recap: you have a service appointment tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM to diagnose and repair the line issue affecting your internet service. You'll get a courtesy call about an hour before the technician arrives.

Customer: Okay. And... this should fix it?

Agent: The technician will be able to determine exactly what the issue is once they're there. In most cases with line problems like this, we're able to get it resolved during that visit. If for some reason it's something more complex, they'll let you know.

Customer: Alright. I guess I'll just have to wait till tomorrow then.

Agent: I'm sorry you're experiencing this today. I wish I could have resolved it remotely for you. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... make sure the technician shows up on time, okay?

Agent: I'll make a note on your account to prioritize this appointment. You should be all set. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll have you back up and running tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a good day.
