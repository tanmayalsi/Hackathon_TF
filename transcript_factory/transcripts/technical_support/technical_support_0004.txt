Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet went down this morning and I've been without it for like three hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I have that here. And just to confirm, this is for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So you're saying your internet went down around... what time was that?

Customer: I'd say around 9 this morning. I tried unplugging the modem and router like I always do, but nothing happened. Just... no lights, no connection. It's been dead ever since.

Agent: Okay, okay. Let's start with the basics then. When you say there are no lights on the modem, is the modem plugged in? Can you check that for me?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's plugged in. I can see it's definitely plugged into the wall and the router too.

Agent: Good. And the power cable—is it fully connected to the back of the modem?

Customer: Let me look... yeah, it's in there pretty good. Wait, actually... (pause) hold on, let me just... okay, yeah it's all the way in.

Agent: Alright. So when you look at the front of the modem, you're saying there are absolutely no lights at all? Not even a power light?

Customer: No, nothing. It's completely dark. The router's got some lights on it, but the modem's just... nothing.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's unusual. So the router is powered on, but the modem isn't. Can you try unplugging the modem for me, just count to ten, and then plug it back in?

Customer: (pause) Sure, yeah. (sounds of movement) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) One, two, three, four, five... ten. Plugging it back in. (pause) I'm looking at it... still nothing. No lights.

Agent: Still no power light at all?

Customer: Nope. Nothing.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Let me check something here. Can you tell me what model modem you have? It should say on a label on top or on the back.

Customer: Uh... (pause) okay, I'm looking... it says Frontier... Quantum Gateway. I think. Quantum something.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your service here and that's the right equipment. Since we're not getting any power indicators, it's possible the modem itself has an issue. But before we go down that road, let me ask—did anything happen before it went out? Like a storm, power outage, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine yesterday. I was working from home all day yesterday, no problems at all. Then I went to bed, woke up this morning, and it was just... gone.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay. Um, you know what, let me try one more thing. Can you unplug everything—the modem, the router, and the power strips they're plugged into—and wait about 30 seconds? This'll do a complete hard reset of your system.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, sure. (pause) Alright, everything's unplugged. I'm waiting. This is taking forever. (pause) Okay, 30 seconds is up. Plugging the modem back in... (sounds of plugging in) and the router. Let me give them a second to boot up...

Agent: Take your time. Sometimes it takes a minute for everything to come back online.

Customer: (pause) Okay... so the router's got lights now, but I'm still looking at the modem and... [inaudible] ...still nothing. Not a single light.

Agent: Still no power light on the modem?

Customer: No. Nothing. This is really strange.

Agent: Yeah, that does sound like a hardware issue. Now, I have a couple of options for you here. The modem appears to have failed, which unfortunately isn't something I can troubleshoot remotely. We can either send you a replacement modem, which would take about five to seven business days, or you could pick one up at a Frontier retail location if there's one near you.

Customer: Wait, five to seven days? I work from home. I can't be without internet that long. (frustration in voice) Is there any way to speed this up?

Agent: I understand completely. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so normally it's five to seven, but since this is a complete service outage, I can put a rush on it and get it to you in two to three business days. I'd just need to process a replacement device order.

Customer: (pause) I guess that's better, but... is there any way to get it faster? Like, can I really not do anything on my end?

Agent: Unfortunately, with the modem showing absolutely no power indicators and not responding to any of our troubleshooting steps, it's definitely a hardware failure. There's nothing on your end that we can fix. I wish I had better news. The two to three day rush is really the fastest I can get it to you through shipping.

Customer: What about that retail location? How far is that from me?

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) I'm showing a location about... about eight miles from you on Highland Drive. They're open until 6 PM today.

Customer: Okay, okay. I mean, that's actually not too bad. Do they definitely have the modem in stock?

Agent: (pause) I'm not able to check real-time inventory from here, I'm sorry. But I can give you the number to call ahead and confirm they have the Quantum Gateway modem available, and then you could just swing by and pick it up today.

Customer: Yeah, I guess that's the best option then. Can you give me that number?

Agent: Absolutely. It's 555-0298. That's the Frontier store at Highland Drive.

Customer: (pause) 555-0298. Got it. Before I go though—when I get this new modem, is there anything I need to do? Like, will it just work or...?

Agent: When you get the new modem, just plug it in, and it should automatically activate on your account. Give it about five to ten minutes to fully boot up and you should be back online. But if you have any trouble, you can always call us back.

Customer: Okay. Alright, I guess that works. This is just really inconvenient, you know?

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. Hopefully you can grab that modem today and get back up and running quickly. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll head out to that store.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks for calling Frontier, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
