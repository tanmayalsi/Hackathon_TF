Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet just went down and I have no idea what's going on. I need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0147. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account, please?

Customer: It's under Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I see your account here. So your internet service went down, is that correct? When did you first notice it wasn't working?

Customer: Maybe like... twenty minutes ago? I was working from home and then everything just stopped. I tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in, but nothing's changed.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on that. That's usually a good first step. Let me look at your account here... (pause) I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area right now, so let's walk through some troubleshooting steps. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your modem right now?

Customer: Uh... (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it. There's a power light that's on, that's green. And then there's... it looks like an internet light and it's red. Or maybe orange? It's definitely not green.

Agent: Okay, the red or orange light on the internet port—that's actually what we're looking for. That typically indicates there's no connection coming from our side. How about any other lights on the modem?

Customer: Um, yeah, there's one more that's... it looks like it might be blinking? It's hard to see from where I'm sitting. Hold on, let me get closer. (pause) Yeah, it's blinking green.

Agent: Alright, that's probably the activity light, so that's normal. What model modem do you have? There should be a sticker on it somewhere.

Customer: Let me see... (pause) It says, um, Frontier... something something... (pause) Okay, it's a Frontier C2000T.

Agent: Great, I know that model well. Alright, so what I want you to do is unplug the power cable from the back of the modem. Just give it about thirty seconds—I know it seems like a long time, but it'll help reset the device.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you also tried that earlier?

Customer: Yeah, I did it once, but I'll do it again. Maybe I didn't wait long enough.

Agent: That could be it. Why don't we just do a full thirty seconds this time to be safe. (pause) Alright, go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) It's lighting up... okay, the green power light is back on. Now I'm waiting for the internet light to change. (pause) Come on... (pause) It's still orange.

Agent: Okay, it sometimes takes about a minute or two to fully boot back up. Why don't you give it just another minute and we'll see if that orange light turns green.

Customer: (pause) ...Nothing. It's still orange. It's been like... I don't know, probably forty-five seconds and it's not changing.

Agent: Alright, let's try something else. I want you to locate the reset button on the modem. It's usually a small button on the back or bottom, and you might need a paperclip or a pen to press it.

Customer: Oh man, okay. (pause) Yeah, I found it. It's on the back. So I just... I hold it down?

Agent: Yes, hold it for about ten seconds. That'll do a factory reset on the modem.

Customer: Okay, here we go. (pause) Holding it... (pause) Alright, I'm letting go. Now what?

Agent: Now let's wait and see if the modem reboots and the internet light comes back to green.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so it's restarting, all the lights went out. They're slowly coming back on now. (pause) Power light is green... (pause) Okay, the internet light is... still orange. This isn't working.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me check a couple of things on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) Can you tell me, Michael, have you had any recent storms in your area or any work done on the line outside?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been nice out. I mean, there's been some wind but nothing crazy.

Agent: Alright, that was just to rule some things out. Let me check the signal levels coming into your modem. (pause) (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm seeing the signal levels are actually within normal range on my end. That's interesting.

Agent: What I'd like to try next is checking if your Ethernet cable is seated properly. Sometimes they can get a little loose. Can you unplug the Ethernet cable from the modem?

Customer: Which one is that?

Agent: It's the one that looks like a phone cord, but slightly thicker. You know, the RJ-45 cable? There should be one coming out of the modem that goes to your computer or router.

Customer: Oh, yeah, I see it. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now can you check the port where it was connected and just make sure there's no damage or anything inside the port? Any bent pins or anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Looks okay from what I can see. Looks normal to me.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in, nice and firm until you hear the click.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's in. I can feel it click. Still orange though.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm going to be honest with you, Michael. The signal is coming through on my end, but the modem isn't responding properly. At this point, I'm thinking there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or possibly an issue with the line coming to your house.

Customer: So what does that mean? How do we fix that?

Agent: Well, the good news is if it's the modem, we can send you a replacement, and it should arrive within 3 to 5 business days. The other possibility is that there's an issue with the line outside, and in that case we'd need to send a technician out to take a look.

Customer: (pause) So I'm just without internet for 3 to 5 days?

Agent: I understand the frustration. Unfortunately, if it's a line issue, we do need to get a technician out there to diagnose it properly. The good news is I can put in a service call for you, and they have appointments available pretty quickly. Let me see what we have. (typing sounds) We have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or Wednesday between 1 and 5 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow is... yeah, tomorrow morning could work. But this is really inconvenient. Is there anything else we can try before we go down that road?

Agent: (pause) Well, let me check one more thing. Can you power cycle the modem one more time for me? And while it's powering back up, I'm going to do a restart on the line from my end.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it again.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm initiating a line reset now. Go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in. (pause) Power's coming back on... (pause) Okay, the modem's running again. I'm watching the lights... the internet light is... still orange.

Agent: (long pause) Okay, I'm still not seeing the connection properly establish. I think at this point, we need to get a technician out there. Unfortunately, this is beyond what we can troubleshoot over the phone.

Customer: Seriously? Okay, fine. Yeah, let's do tomorrow morning then. What time exactly?

Agent: The window is 8 AM to 12 PM. The technician may arrive anytime within that window. You'll receive a confirmation call or text about 30 minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Okay, that works. Anything else I need to know?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home to let them in, and if you could have easy access to your modem and the outside lines, that would help. The technician will take care of everything from there.

Customer: Alright, got it. So I should just... leave everything as it is until they get here, right?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Don't unplug anything else or try any other troubleshooting. Just leave it as is. The technician will handle it. I've got your appointment scheduled for tomorrow, 8 AM to 12 PM, at 555-0147. And you should get a confirmation notification.

Customer: Alright. Well, I guess I'm just hoping this gets resolved tomorrow.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll get you back online as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks for trying anyway, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. We appreciate your patience, and sorry again for the inconvenience. Have a good evening.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
