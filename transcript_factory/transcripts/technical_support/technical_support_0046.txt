Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember approximately what time that happened?

Customer: Yeah, around 8 o'clock, maybe 8:15. I was just trying to check my email and nothing would load.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm, you have our Fiber service, correct?

Customer: Yes, the fiber connection. That's what I've had for about two years now, and it's usually pretty reliable.

Agent: Great. Well, let's see what we can figure out here. First, can you tell me... do you see any lights on your modem right now? Like, is it powered on?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's... the power light is on, but it's... hmm, actually the internet light isn't on. It's usually blue but right now it's just off.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The internet light being off usually means there's no connection coming in. Have there been any storms in your area recently, or any kind of outage notification that you might've received?

Customer: No, no storms. The weather's been pretty clear actually. And I didn't get any notification about an outage.

Agent: Okay. Well, let's try a couple of things. First, I'd like you to unplug the modem from power. Just pull it out completely.

Customer: Okay, I'm doing that now... it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now can you leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds? Just to fully power it down.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm waiting... it's been about 30 seconds. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. The power light came back on... and we're waiting for the internet light to...

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, this usually takes about a minute or so for it to reconnect. Go ahead and give it a moment.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking at it... the internet light is still... no, it's still off. It's not coming back on.

Agent: Hmm, alright. Let me ask you this—do you have a gateway or is it just the modem?

Customer: I'm not sure what the difference is, honestly. It's just the one device. It's a Frontier box, I think it says... (pause) yeah, it's a model F3000 or something like that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, that's our gateway unit. Those are pretty reliable. Can you tell me what the other lights are showing? You said the power light is on...

Customer: Yeah, so power is on, that's green. There's a battery light that's off. And then... I think there's a WiFi light that's blinking red.

Agent: Red and blinking?

Customer: Yeah, red and blinking, not solid. Does that mean something?

Agent: (pause) That usually indicates that the gateway is having trouble connecting to our network. Um... okay, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) What's your service address, James?

Customer: 442 Maple Street, apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright... okay, I'm looking at your account here and... I'm not seeing any active outages reported in your area. Let me... let me see if I can ping your device.

Customer: Ping it? Is that like... checking if it's there?

Agent: Exactly, yeah. Checking if the device is communicating with our network. (pause) (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not getting a response. Okay, so the gateway definitely isn't connected right now. Let me have you try something else. Can you unplug the power cable from the back of the gateway?

Customer: The actual cable coming from the wall?

Agent: Yeah, exactly. And then count to about ten seconds, and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's unplugged... (pause) one... two... three... (pause) okay, that's about ten seconds, I'm plugging it back in now.

Agent: Good. And watch those lights closely. What do you see happening?

Customer: (pause) Um, the power light is on, it's starting up. The battery light came on for a second... and now... the internet light is... it's amber now? It's like a yellow-orange color.

Agent: Okay, yellow is better than red. That usually means it's trying to connect. Just give it a bit more time and it should turn blue or green.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm just... looking at it... (pause) it's still yellow. How long should I wait?

Agent: Give it about another minute.

Customer: (pause) It's been about a minute now and it's still yellow. Does that mean something's wrong?

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) It... it might. Yellow usually means it's in a connecting state, but it shouldn't stay yellow for more than about a minute or two. Let me try to reach the gateway from my end. (pause) (typing sounds) [inaudible] ...that's strange. I'm still not getting any network connection from your device.

Customer: What does that mean? Is my gateway broken?

Agent: Not necessarily. It could be a few things. But I want to try one more thing before we figure out next steps. Is there a reset button on your gateway?

Customer: A reset button? (pause) Um, I think there's a little button on the bottom or the back. Let me look... yeah, there's a small button. It says "Reset" next to it.

Agent: Okay, but before you press that, I need to warn you—if you press that button, it's going to wipe all your settings, and we're going to have to set the whole thing up again. So let's... let's not do that quite yet.

Customer: Okay, good, because I don't really want to do all that.

Agent: I don't blame you. (pause) Um... (typing sounds) Okay, so what I'm thinking is that there might be a line issue, or the gateway might not be provisioned correctly on our network right now. Let me just double-check something. When's the last time you remember your internet working properly?

Customer: This morning around 8 o'clock. Before that, yesterday evening, everything was fine.

Agent: Okay. And you didn't change anything on your end? Like, you didn't move the gateway or unplug anything?

Customer: No, no. It's been in the same spot the whole time.

Agent: Alright. (pause) James, I hate to say this, but I think what's happening is either there's a line issue coming into your apartment, or the gateway itself might need to be replaced. Unfortunately, I can't get the device to communicate with our network, which means we can't reconfigure it from my end.

Customer: So what do I do? Can you send someone out?

Agent: Yeah, we can definitely schedule a technician to come out and take a look at the line and the equipment. They can test everything and either get it working or replace the gateway if needed. Unfortunately, our earliest availability is... (typing sounds) ...next Tuesday, between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Next Tuesday? That's four days away. I need internet before that. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand, and I wish I had something sooner. Let me see if there's any earlier appointments... (pause) (typing sounds) Unfortunately, Tuesday is the soonest we have available in your area right now. I'm really sorry about that.

Customer: (frustrated) This is frustrating. Is there anything I can do in the meantime?

Agent: Unfortunately, with the gateway not connecting to the network, there's not a lot we can troubleshoot from here. You could try... (pause) you could try connecting to a mobile hotspot from your phone if you have one, just as a temporary workaround until the tech can get out there.

Customer: Yeah, I guess I could do that. Okay, so I should just schedule this technician visit for Tuesday then?

Agent: Yes, let me get that set up for you. I'll put it as a priority appointment since you're experiencing a complete service outage. We'll have someone out between noon and 4 PM on Tuesday. And we'll send you a confirmation email and possibly a text message with the details and a window closer to the appointment.

Customer: Okay. Alright. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved today, James. But our technician will definitely take care of you on Tuesday. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll get you back online soon.

Customer: Alright, bye.

Agent: Take care, James.
