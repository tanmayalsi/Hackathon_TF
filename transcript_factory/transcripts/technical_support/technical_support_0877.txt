Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is David. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I've got work stuff I need to do and it's getting pretty frustrating.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll get this sorted out for you. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here... I've got you down as Michael Torres on Maple Street in Cheyenne, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have you tried unplugging your modem and router yet?

Customer: I mean... not really. I just tried turning it off and back on through the power button. Does that make a difference?

Agent: Actually, yes, it does. When you unplug them completely, it does a hard reset, which can clear out some issues the soft restart won't catch. Do you have a couple of minutes to try that right now?

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) So I just... unplug everything?

Agent: Exactly. Go ahead and unplug your modem first—that's the box with all the lights on it. Then unplug the router. Just wait about thirty seconds, and then plug the modem back in first.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, unplugging now... (pause) ...alright, waiting. This is the modem, right? The bigger one?

Agent: The one with the lights on it, yeah. Is it plugged back in?

Customer: Just plugged it back in. Now what?

Agent: Give it about a minute to boot back up. You should see the lights come back on. While that's happening, go ahead and plug the router back in as well.

Customer: (pause) Okay, router's back in. (pause) I'm looking at the modem now and... yeah, the lights are coming back on. We got blue and green lights.

Agent: Perfect. That's what we want to see. Now go ahead and try to connect to your Wi-Fi network on one of your devices.

Customer: Alright, give me a second... (pause) Okay, I'm on my phone. I'm going to... (pause) ...hmm. The network's showing up but when I try to connect it just keeps saying "can't connect to this network."

Agent: Okay, that's... let me ask you a few questions. Has anything changed with your setup recently? Any new equipment, or...?

Customer: No, nothing. It was working fine yesterday.

Agent: And you haven't noticed any storms or anything like that in your area last night?

Customer: Actually, now that you mention it, there was pretty bad weather last night. Heavy wind, some lightning. Could that...?

Agent: That could definitely be a factor. Sometimes power surges or weather can affect the equipment. Let's try a couple more things. Can you check the back of your modem? I need you to tell me if all the cables are firmly connected.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it. There's... the power cable, and then there's a cable going into the wall. Those both look secure.

Agent: Good. Now, sometimes there's also an ethernet cable or a coax cable. Do you see anything else plugged in?

Customer: There's a thick gray cable that goes up into the wall, kind of behind the router. That one looks pretty solid.

Agent: That's the coax cable, which is your internet line coming in. That's good. Now, have you checked if there are any visible lights on the modem right now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the power light is solid green. There's a... internet light? That one's blinking red.

Agent: (pause) Okay, that red blinking light tells us the modem isn't seeing a signal coming from our network.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Is it my equipment?

Agent: Not necessarily. It could be on our end or yours. Let me check your line here. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm showing that there was a service interruption in your area this morning at around 7 AM, but it should've been resolved by 9:30. Let me run a signal test on your line...

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (pause) I'm getting a response, which is good. The signal is actually coming through. So the issue might be with your modem itself, or there could still be something not quite right with the connection.

Customer: So what do I do?

Agent: Let's try one more thing. Can you restart just the modem one more time? Sometimes they need a second reset.

Customer: Sure. (pause) Unplugging it again. (pause) Waiting... (pause) Okay, plugging back in.

Customer: (pause) The lights are coming back up... I got green, green... now there's the red blinking again.

Agent: Still red?

Customer: Yeah, still blinking red. Nothing's changed.

Agent: (pause) Alright, so that's... that's concerning. The signal's coming from our end, but your modem isn't latching onto it. Have you had any issues with this modem before?

Customer: Not that I can remember. I've had it for... I don't know, maybe two years?

Agent: Okay. (typing sounds) Let me see what we have on file. (pause) I'm not seeing a history of issues. Given that red light and the signal not establishing even after the resets, I think your modem may have been damaged during that storm last night. Power surges can sometimes do that.

Customer: So I need a new modem?

Agent: That would be my recommendation, yeah. Unfortunately, the modem itself isn't something we can fix over the phone. We would need to get you a replacement unit. I can set up a technician appointment for you, or we can overnight you a modem if you want to try installing it yourself. Most customers find the self-installation pretty straightforward.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet up.

Agent: If we overnight it, it should arrive tomorrow by noon. You'd have it installed and running by end of business tomorrow hopefully. Or, a technician could come out... (pause) (typing sounds) ...the earliest I'm showing is Thursday afternoon.

Customer: That's two days away.

Agent: I know it's not ideal, especially with the weather we had. The overnight modem would definitely be faster for you.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Let's do that. Can you do that for me?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me just get some information. (pause) Is the service address still 447 Maple Street?

Customer: Yep, that's it.

Agent: And a contact number where we can reach you when it arrives?

Customer: The number you called me on should be fine.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I've got that set up. The modem will ship out today and should be there tomorrow morning. When it arrives, we can either have you try the self-install, or if you'd prefer, you can still schedule a technician visit for when it gets there.

Customer: I'll probably try to set it up myself first. How hard is it?

Agent: Pretty simple, actually. We'll send you all the instructions, and honestly, it's basically just connecting cables the same way your current modem is connected. Plug in power, plug in the coax cable, and let it boot up.

Customer: Okay, I can do that.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. So just to confirm—the modem ships today and gets here tomorrow?

Agent: That's right. You should see tracking information in your email within a few hours, and it'll arrive by noon tomorrow.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate it. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome. I'm sorry you had this experience, especially with the storm situation. We'll get you back online. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
