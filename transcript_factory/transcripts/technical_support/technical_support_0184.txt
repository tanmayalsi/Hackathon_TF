# Frontier Communications - Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. One second... Alright, I've got your account here. It looks like you're in the Riverside area on a fiber connection. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. We just got the fiber installed like three months ago and it's been great until now.

Agent: Great. Well, let's see what we can figure out here. First thing I always like to check—have you tried restarting your modem and router yet?

Customer: Yeah, I did that like the first thing. I unplugged both of them, waited about a minute, plugged them back in. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's good you already tried that. Um, when you say nothing's working, are you seeing any lights on the modem at all? Like, are they on, off, or blinking?

Customer: Uh, well the modem is on. It's... there's like a power light that's green, but the internet light—I think it's the one that usually shows the connection—that one's not on. It's just off.

Agent: Okay, so the power is good but the internet indicator isn't lighting up. That's actually helpful information. Do you have the model number of your modem? It should be on the front or the back of the unit.

Customer: Hold on, let me look. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it now. It says... uh, the model is FN-2400X.

Agent: (typing sounds) FN-2400X, perfect. Alright, I'm going to walk you through a few more things. Can you tell me if there's a cable that goes from the wall into the modem? Is that cable plugged in securely?

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's the, um... (pause) looks like the coaxial cable? Is that what you call it? The thick one?

Agent: Actually, with fiber, it should be a different type of cable. It's usually thinner and kind of looks like a phone cable but slightly bigger, with a little clip on the end. Do you see something like that?

Customer: Oh, you know what, I think I might be looking at the wrong... oh wait, yeah, I see it. There's like a thin cable and yeah, it's got a little clip thing. It's plugged in.

Agent: Good. And is the clip secure? Sometimes these can get a little loose. Can you just kind of tug on it gently to make sure it's really in there?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, seems pretty tight to me. I mean, it's not going anywhere.

Agent: Alright, that's good. Okay, so we've got power, we've got the connection cable secure, but no internet light. Let me ask you this—have there been any outages in your area lately or any weather issues? I know we had some storms come through that region a couple days ago.

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine today. And I didn't see anything about an outage when I checked online... well, I mean, I checked on my phone with data.

Agent: Right, of course. (pause) Okay, let me actually check our systems on my end here. (typing sounds) Let me see... (pause) I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area currently. But let me run a quick diagnostic on your line.

(longer pause, background noise from agent's side)

Agent: Okay, so... the diagnostic is showing that we're not getting a signal from your modem to our equipment. That usually means either there's an issue with the connection at your end or there might be something going on on our side with the line itself.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Is it fixable?

Agent: Well, let me have you try one more thing. I want you to do what's called a factory reset on the modem. Now, this will clear all the settings, so don't do this lightly, but let me walk you through it.

Customer: Okay, um, if you think that'll help.

Agent: Great. So, on the back of the modem, there should be a small button that says "Reset." You might need to use a paperclip or a pen to press it because it's recessed. Can you find that?

Customer: (pause) Uh, yeah, I see a little hole back here. I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so while the modem is powered on, I want you to press and hold that reset button for about ten seconds. Ready?

Customer: Okay, yeah. (pause) Holding it now... (pause) okay, that's ten. I let go.

Agent: Alright, give it about thirty seconds to restart and reboot. While that's happening, are you seeing the lights do anything different?

Customer: They're just... they kind of blinked for a second there, and now... (pause) still just the green power light. The internet light's still not coming on.

Agent: Okay, that's... hmm. (pause) Let me wait another moment here. Sometimes these take a little bit longer to fully reconnect. (longer pause) You know what, let me check something on my end while we wait. (typing sounds) 

I'm going to be honest with you—this is pointing to something that might need some more hands-on attention. The fact that we're not seeing any signal on our end after the reset is... it could be a few things. It could be an issue with the line coming into your house, or it could be something more serious with the modem itself.

Customer: So you're saying... what, you can't fix this over the phone?

Agent: Well, let me try just one or two more things before we go down that road. Sometimes these issues resolve themselves. Have you had any recent work done in your home? Like any electricians or contractors, or have you maybe moved the modem recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been sitting in the same spot the whole time. We really haven't touched it except to restart it today.

Agent: Okay, that's good info. And the cable outside, the one running to your house—do you know if it's been damaged at all? Like, have any trees fallen on it or anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Um, not that I can see from the window. Let me check real quick. (pause) No, looks okay to me.

Agent: Alright. You know, I appreciate you working through all this with me. I've gone through all the basic troubleshooting steps I can do remotely, and unfortunately, we're still not seeing a connection on our end. What I think we're going to need to do here is get a technician out to your location to do an on-site inspection.

Customer: Really? How long would that take? I mean, I need my internet back pretty soon. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) So, the earliest I can get someone out to you would be... it looks like tomorrow morning, between 9 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? (pause) I mean, I guess it'll have to. Can they definitely fix it?

Agent: A technician will be able to do a full inspection of both your equipment and the line coming into your house, and they'll be able to tell you exactly what the issue is. Nine times out of ten, these things are a quick fix once they get eyes on it. So yes, I'm confident they'll be able to help.

Customer: Alright, alright. Yeah, let's do that. Tomorrow morning works.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so you're all set. We have a technician scheduled to arrive at your address tomorrow between 9 AM and noon. Make sure someone's home to let them in. You'll get a courtesy call about thirty minutes before they arrive as well.

Customer: Got it. Yeah, I'll be here. Do I need to do anything before they arrive? Just leave it how it is?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Just leave everything as is. Don't mess with it anymore. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it resolved today, but the technician will get you taken care of tomorrow. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's fine. Thanks.

Agent: Great. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
