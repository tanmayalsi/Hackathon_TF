# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet's been down since this morning and I can't figure out what's going on. I've got work meetings in like an hour and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Uh, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. And your name?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. So you're experiencing a complete outage—the internet is completely down?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. No lights on the modem, nothing. Well, actually, I think there might be like one light, but I'm not sure. The whole thing's pretty dark.

Agent: Okay, let's start with the basics. Can you tell me where your modem and router are located?

Customer: They're in my office, on the desk actually. Right here in front of me.

Agent: Great. So what I'd like you to do is take a look at the modem. Do you see any lights on it at all? And if you do, what color are they and are they steady or blinking?

Customer: (pause) Um, so there's like a... I think there's a power light that's... no wait, I don't think that's on either. Hmm.

Agent: Alright, so it sounds like the modem might not have power. Can you check if the power cable is plugged in? It should be going into the back of the modem and then to an outlet.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Oh! Oh, yeah. The power cable is definitely plugged in. Yeah, it's... (pause) wait, hold on, let me check the outlet. Is the outlet supposed to have something else plugged into it?

Agent: Not necessarily. There could be other things, but the modem should be getting power from that outlet. What do you see?

Customer: Okay, so there's... there's the modem cable, and then I see like a—it looks like the outlet itself might be... I don't know, it doesn't look right. The little holes kind of look dark or something.

Agent: Hmm, interesting. The outlet itself might be the issue. Do you have anything else you could try plugging in, like a lamp or a phone charger, just to test if that outlet is working?

Customer: Yeah, I have a lamp here. (pause) (sounds of movement) Okay, plugging it in... (pause) Nope. Nothing. The lamp's not turning on.

Agent: Okay, so the outlet appears to be dead. That's likely the issue then. Do you have another outlet available that we could try the modem in? Maybe in another room?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I have outlets in the living room, hallway, whatever. Where would you want me to move it to?

Agent: Any outlet should work, just try to find one that's reasonably close so the cables reach. Let's try the living room if that works for you.

Customer: Okay, hang on. (background noise, sounds of unplugging, movement) Alright, so I'm moving it to the living room outlet... (more rustling) Got it plugged in. Now what?

Agent: Now let's wait a few moments and see if the lights come on on the modem. This usually takes about thirty seconds to a minute.

Customer: (pause) Okay... so nothing yet. Should I do something? Like restart it or...?

Agent: Let's just give it another moment. The modem needs to boot up fully. (pause) Okay, how about now?

Customer: (pause) Uh... I see a light now! Yeah, there's a light on. It's like orange or amber colored?

Agent: Good! That's normal—it's booting up. We should see it turn green once it's fully connected. Let's give it another minute or two.

Customer: (pause) Okay... still amber... (pause longer) It's been like... maybe thirty seconds? Still amber.

Agent: That's fine. Sometimes it takes a couple minutes. While we wait, let me ask—have you noticed any recent storms in your area, or any power issues at your house?

Customer: No, not really. I mean, we had some wind yesterday but nothing crazy. Why, is that a problem?

Agent: It could be—sometimes power surges from weather can damage outlets or equipment. It's just something to keep in mind. (pause) How's that modem looking?

Customer: Still orange. Is that bad?

Agent: No, it should be fine. Actually, sometimes it takes up to five minutes. Let me just check your account here to see if there are any service outages in your area. (typing sounds)

Customer: Okay. Actually, while you're doing that—how long do you think this will take total? Because I really do need to be ready for that meeting.

Agent: I understand. Well, normally we'd have you back up and running within about ten or fifteen minutes from now. But let me see here... (pause) Okay, I'm not showing any outages in your area, which is good. 

Customer: That's something, I guess. Any luck on your end?

Agent: Let me just pull up some diagnostics... (typing sounds) So, everything looks normal on our end. How is that light doing now?

Customer: (pause) Still the same. Orange. Are you sure it's supposed to turn green? Because it's been like two minutes now.

Agent: Yes, it should turn green once it's fully connected to our network. (pause) The fact that it's staying amber is a bit unusual. Let me try a different approach. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Unplug it? Okay... (rustling) It's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait about thirty seconds—I'm going to count it out for you. Ten, twenty, thirty. Okay, now plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in now. (sounds of plugging) Okay, plugged in.

Agent: Alright, let's see if that helps reset it. We should see it go through the boot sequence again.

Customer: (pause) It's doing the thing again—the light's there, but it's amber. Same as before.

Agent: Okay. Let me ask—when you look at the back of the modem, do you see an ethernet cable plugged into it? Or a coaxial cable? Either of those?

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) There's like a thick black cable, and then there's like a regular network cable. Both plugged in?

Agent: Okay, good. And the thick black cable—that's the coaxial cable that should be coming from your wall outlet or from outside. Is that plugged in tight?

Customer: (pause) Seems like it. It's like... hand-tight, I guess?

Agent: Can you try twisting it a little bit tighter, just to make sure it's secure?

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, I'm... (grunt) okay, it's pretty tight now. Should that have been the issue?

Agent: It could be. Loose connections can definitely cause these problems. Let's see if that helps. Give it another minute to reconnect. (pause)

Customer: (pause) Okay... I'm looking at it... still orange. How much longer is this supposed to take?

Agent: This is unusual. Normally with the coaxial cable reseated it should connect. Let me try to run a remote diagnostic on the modem itself. (typing sounds) Actually, you know what, I'm not getting a response from the modem at this point. And if the lights aren't changing, there might be an issue with the modem hardware itself, or possibly with the signal coming in.

Customer: Wait, what does that mean? Like, the modem is broken?

Agent: It could be, but I don't want to say that for certain yet. It's also possible that there's an issue with the line coming into your house. I think at this point what we should do is schedule a technician to come out and take a look. They can test the line and either repair it or replace the modem if needed.

Customer: How long would that take? How soon could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... We have some slots available tomorrow morning between 8 AM and 12 PM, or tomorrow afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. We could also potentially do Thursday morning.

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow morning? So nothing today?

Agent: Unfortunately, our technicians are fully booked for today. I wish I had something available sooner given your situation. Would tomorrow morning work for you?

Customer: (frustrated sigh) I mean, I don't have a choice, right? Tomorrow morning, then. Can they guarantee they'll be there? Because the last time I had someone come out, they were like two hours late.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. The morning appointment is a four-hour window, so technically they could arrive anytime between 8 AM and noon. I know that's not ideal. They will make their best effort to be there. Let me just get your contact information to confirm this appointment and the technician can call you about thirty minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Okay, fine. My number's 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, I have that on file already. Is there anything else I can help you with while we're on the line?

Customer: No, I don't think so. I mean, this isn't really helpful for my meeting today but... can I at least get like a credit or something for being down?

Agent: That's actually a great question. Let me make a note on your account here that you experienced a service outage. (typing sounds) The credit requests typically get reviewed after the service is restored or when the technician completes the visit, so I'd recommend mentioning it to the technician when they're here. They can often process credits more quickly.

Customer: Alright. So tomorrow morning, 8 to 12. Anything I need to do to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure the modem is accessible and that someone is home. The technician will take care of the rest. And in the meantime, if you need internet connectivity, you could potentially use your mobile phone's hotspot to get through your meeting today.

Customer: Yeah, I might have to do that. Okay, well, thank you I guess. Sorry for being short, it's just been a frustrating morning.

Agent: No, I completely understand. I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online immediately. But we'll make sure the technician takes great care of you tomorrow morning. Is there anything else I can do for you today?

Customer: No, that's it. I appreciate your help, even if we couldn't fix it.

Agent: Thank you for your patience, David. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with the appointment details. If you have any questions, you can call us back anytime. Thanks for choosing Frontier Communications.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
