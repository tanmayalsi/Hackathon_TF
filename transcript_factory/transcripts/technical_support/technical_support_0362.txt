Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of, but it's still not working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll get this figured out for you. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up here... Alright, I've got you. I see you're in the Springdale area, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you noticed any lights on your router or modem at all?

Customer: Um, let me look... The modem has like, the power light is on, but I think the internet light is red. Or orange maybe? It's definitely not green like it usually is.

Agent: Okay, that's good information. That typically indicates a connection issue. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, doing that now.

Agent: Great. While we wait, has anything unusual happened today? Any storms in your area or work being done outside your home?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine this morning, you know? I was on a video call for work and then suddenly it just dropped.

Agent: Gotcha. Alright, let's leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds. (pause) While we're waiting, have you had any issues with your service recently? Any outages or slowness?

Customer: No, it's been pretty solid actually. This is the first real problem I've had since we switched to Frontier like... six months ago?

Agent: Excellent. That's good to know. Okay, go ahead and plug that modem back in now.

Customer: (background noise of cord being plugged in) Okay, plugged it back in.

Agent: Perfect. Give it about a minute to fully boot up. We should see those lights come back on. Let me know when you see some activity.

Customer: (pause) Okay, um... I'm seeing the power light come back on. It's... it's cycling. Some of the other lights are blinking now too.

Agent: Great, that's what we want to see. Go ahead and give it another 30 seconds or so to fully initialize.

Customer: (pause) Alright... okay, so now I'm seeing... the internet light is still... it's still orange. Or red. I don't know, it's kind of a red-orange color.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Is your router separate from your modem, or is it all in one unit?

Customer: It's separate. I have like a separate wireless router.

Agent: Okay, can you check the router as well? Look for similar lights—power and internet connection indicators.

Customer: (pause) The router looks okay. It's... the lights look normal on it. It's got the blue lights on, which is what it usually looks like.

Agent: Alright, so the router seems fine but the modem is still showing that connection issue. Let me try a couple more things. Can you check the cable connections for me? First, is there a coaxial cable—it looks like a thick cable with metal connectors on the ends—going into the back of your modem?

Customer: Oh, um, yeah, I see it. It looks... I don't know, it looks pretty secure from what I can tell.

Agent: Can you try gently disconnecting it and reconnecting it? Just make sure it's snug.

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Okay, I'm doing that. It seems tight. I reconnected it.

Agent: Good. And do you see an ethernet cable going from the modem to the router?

Customer: Yeah, I see that too. It's... it looks fine, I think.

Agent: Okay, let's try one more thing. I'm going to check our system here to see if there are any outages or issues on our end. (typing sounds) Let me just pull up your service address... Okay, checking the network... (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area right now. Let me check if there's anything specific to your line...

Customer: (pause) Okay, so it's probably something on my end then?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. It might be your modem itself, or there could be something with the line coming into your home. Sometimes we can tell from our end if there's a signal issue. (pause) I'm checking the modem status here and... hmm, I'm actually not seeing any signal coming from your modem.

Customer: What do you mean, not seeing any signal?

Agent: It means the modem isn't registering as connected to our network. Now, that could mean a few things—either there's an issue with the modem itself, or there's a line problem somewhere between our network and your house.

Customer: Oh man, this is frustrating. So what do we do?

Agent: Well, let me try one more diagnostic thing. Do you see any buttons on the modem? Like a reset button or anything?

Customer: (pause) I see a tiny button here that's kind of recessed. I'm guessing that's the reset button?

Agent: That's probably it, yes. Now, I want to warn you—if you press this, it's going to reset the modem to factory settings, so you might lose your settings. But let's try it and see if it helps. Go ahead and use something like a paperclip or a pen to press and hold it for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) (background noise) Okay, pressing it... holding it... (pause) I can see the lights are going crazy now. They're all blinking.

Agent: Perfect, that's expected. Let's give it a few minutes to reboot completely.

Customer: (long pause) How long do you think this will take?

Agent: Usually a couple of minutes. While we wait, do you remember the default network name and password for your modem? It might be on a sticker on the bottom of the unit.

Customer: Oh, um, let me flip it over and check. (pause) Yeah, I see it. So I'm going to have to reconnect to all my stuff?

Agent: Most likely yes, but let's see if this even fixes the connection first. Give it another minute.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Alright, I'm looking at it now and... the internet light is still orange. Same thing as before.

Agent: (sigh) Okay, unfortunately we're back to square one. This is usually an indication that the modem either isn't compatible with our network, or it's failing. Since we've exhausted the basic troubleshooting steps...

Customer: So what are you saying? Like, the modem is broken?

Agent: It's possible, yes. Or—and this is also a possibility—there could be a signal issue on the line coming to your home that we'd need to check physically. I'd recommend having a technician come out to your property to diagnose this. They can check the line, check the signal strength, and if needed, we can get you a replacement modem as well.

Customer: Oh great, so I have to schedule a technician visit? How long before someone can come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability for you. What days work best for you?

Customer: I mean, I work from home, so I kind of need this fixed ASAP. Can they come out today?

Agent: (pause) Let me see... Unfortunately, today is pretty booked. But I can get someone out to you tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM. Does that work?

Customer: I guess it'll have to. This is really inconvenient. I have calls scheduled tomorrow too.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. The technician should be able to get this resolved pretty quickly once they're there. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess not. Just... get me scheduled for tomorrow.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to send a confirmation email to the address on file. The service window is 8 AM to 5 PM, and the technician will actually call you about 30 minutes before they arrive so you can be ready. Your reference number is 847-FTR-2019. Make sure you keep that handy.

Customer: Okay, got it. 847-FTR-2019.

Agent: That's correct. Is there anything else I can do for you today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and I apologize again for the trouble. We'll get this fixed for you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye!
