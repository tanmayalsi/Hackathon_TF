Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get it fixed because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 555, 847-2134.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. Just to confirm, is this for the service address at 4291 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went down this morning. When exactly did you first notice it wasn't working?

Customer: I'd say around 8 o'clock or so? I tried to log into a Zoom call and nothing was happening. The router lights are still on though, so that's... I don't know, probably a good sign?

Agent: Actually, that's helpful information. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Can you tell me if you're seeing any specific lights on the router right now? Like, are they blinking, solid, or is there a red light anywhere?

Customer: Um, (pause) the power light is solid green, the WiFi light is green and blinking, but... there's a red light on the internet port. Is that bad?

Agent: Okay, so that red light on the internet port typically indicates there's no connection coming into your modem. That actually helps narrow things down. Have you tried restarting the modem yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. How do I do that?

Agent: It's really simple. Just unplug the power cable from the back of the modem, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. While you're doing that, I'm going to check if there are any outages in your area.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging now... (pause) ...and... waiting. (pause) Alright, it's plugged back in.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about a minute to boot back up. While we wait, let me just pull up the outage map here... (typing sounds) No, I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area. That's good news.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, how long until it's back up?

Agent: Well, give it just another 30 seconds or so. The modem needs time to fully restart and reconnect. What you're looking for is that red light on the internet port to turn either green or turn off completely.

Customer: (pause) Uh... okay, I'm looking at it. Still red though.

Agent: Still red? Okay. Let me try a different approach. Can you check something for me? On the back of the modem, there should be a cable coming in from the wall. Can you make sure that cable is firmly connected on both ends?

Customer: (pause, sounds of movement) Yeah, I'm checking it now... the cable that comes from the wall goes into the... into the port that says "line" or something?

Agent: Exactly, that's the one. Just make sure it's pushed in all the way until you hear it click.

Customer: (brief pause) Okay, yeah, it seems pretty tight. Wait... (pause) Oh! One of the lights just changed! Now I've got... it looks like a yellow light on the internet port.

Agent: Okay, yellow is progress. That usually means it's trying to sync. Let's give it another 30 seconds or so to see if it turns green.

Customer: (pause) Come on, come on... (pause) No, it's still yellow.

Agent: Alright, still yellow. That sometimes happens. Let me try one more thing. I'm going to send a restart signal to your modem from here on my end. That might help it complete the sync. Give me just a second.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've sent that. What you should see in the next minute or two is the lights going through a brief restart cycle. They might flicker or go off for a moment.

Customer: Got it, I'm watching them. (pause) They just went off for a second... and... okay, they're coming back on. Still yellow though.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Okay, I'm going to be honest with you. The yellow light persisting usually indicates a connection issue with the line coming into your home. This might be something on our end that we need to investigate further, or there could be an issue with the cable itself.

Customer: What do you mean? Like, is something broken?

Agent: Not necessarily. It could be a few things. Sometimes there's an issue with the signal coming from our network to your home. Or occasionally the line can be damaged somewhere. But we'd need to send a technician out to diagnose it properly.

Customer: A technician? How long would that take? I really need this working today.

Agent: (pause) I understand. Let me check our availability... (typing sounds) Looking at today's schedule, we have a technician that could come out this afternoon between 2 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) I guess it has to, right? Do you have anything earlier?

Agent: Unfortunately, that's the earliest we have available for same-day service. I can also put you down for tomorrow morning if you'd prefer more flexibility.

Customer: No, no, this afternoon is... that's fine. I'll make it work.

Agent: Great. So just to recap before we get you scheduled, I wasn't able to resolve this with the troubleshooting steps we tried. The modem appears to not be establishing a connection with our network, which typically requires a technician to inspect the line and the equipment. Is there anything else I can help clarify before I get you on the schedule?

Customer: No, I think I understand. So someone's coming between 2 and 4 today?

Agent: That's correct. You should receive a courtesy call about 30 minutes before the technician arrives. They'll let you know their exact ETA. Is the phone number I have on file, the 555 number, still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. And just as a heads up, we won't charge you for this service visit since the issue appears to be on our end. Once the technician gets here, they'll be able to diagnose exactly what's happening and get you back online.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I appreciate that.

Agent: You're welcome. I'm sorry we couldn't get it working over the phone, but we'll definitely get you sorted out this afternoon. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's... that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
