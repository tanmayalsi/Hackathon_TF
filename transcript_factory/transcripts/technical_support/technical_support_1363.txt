# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back on. I've tried restarting my router and everything.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And just to confirm, is this for the service at... 428 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, so you're experiencing a complete internet outage, and you've already tried restarting the router—that's a good first step. Can you tell me, do you see any lights on the router right now? Are they lit up at all?

Customer: Um, let me look... Yeah, there's like a red light. It's just solid red.

Agent: Okay, solid red. And is that the power light or... do you see multiple lights?

Customer: (pause) There's just one light and it's red. The rest of them aren't on.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful information. So what we're looking at is the device isn't fully powered on or it's not establishing a connection. Let's try unplugging the router completely. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Let that sit for about 30 seconds, and while you're waiting, I'm actually noticing here that we did have a service alert in your area earlier today. There might be some residual network activity. But let's see if a full reset helps. Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. Now we're going to give it about two to three minutes to fully boot up and establish a connection. This is a good time to check—when was the last time you restarted this router before today?

Customer: Oh, I don't know, maybe... a few weeks ago? I restart it every now and then when things are slow.

Agent: That's good maintenance. Alright, so what we should be seeing is the lights come back on sequentially. You should see the power light, then maybe an internet light or connection light. Are you seeing anything change yet?

Customer: Um... (pause) Just the red light again. It's still just red.

Agent: Still just the red light. Okay. And you're not seeing any green or blue lights at all?

Customer: Nope, nothing. Just red.

Agent: Alright, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your modem status here... it looks like it's showing as disconnected on our network. That's interesting. Can you do me a favor and check the cables for me? I want to make sure the coaxial cable—that's the thick cable that comes in from outside—is plugged in securely to the modem.

Customer: The modem? Wait, I thought we were talking about the router.

Agent: Great question. So you have both a modem and a router, right? The modem is what connects to the outside line, and the router is what sends the signal throughout your home.

Customer: Oh! Oh okay, yeah. I see it now. There's like a white box and then the black box.

Agent: Perfect. The white box is your modem. Can you check that the thick cable going into the white box is plugged in all the way? Sometimes it can wiggle loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm checking... it looks pretty tight to me. But let me... (rustling sounds) ...let me unplug it and plug it back in just to be sure.

Agent: Good thinking.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Excellent. Now, give that modem about 30 seconds again to reboot. While we wait, I'm going to check if there's anything else on our end. Have you noticed any other issues with your service recently? Outages, slowness, anything like that?

Customer: No, it's been working fine until today. Just completely stopped.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm looking at the line status and... hmm, I'm actually not seeing a signal coming through on our end. When was the last time you definitely had internet working?

Customer: Like an hour ago? I was working from home and everything was fine, and then just suddenly it all went down.

Agent: Okay, so it was a sudden outage. And you haven't done anything with the equipment, like unplugging things or anything before it went down?

Customer: No, nothing. I was just sitting here using it.

Agent: Alright. Are you seeing the modem lights doing anything different now?

Customer: (pause) Um... I see a different light now, like an amber or orange light?

Agent: Okay, that's actually good—that means it's trying to sync. That's progress. Let that keep blinking for a minute or so. Sometimes it takes a little while to fully reconnect.

Customer: Okay... (long pause) ...it's still just doing the orange light. Nothing else.

Agent: Still just orange? It's not connecting to the network. Let me try a couple more things. Can you check the back of the white box and see if there are any other cables plugged in? Like a phone line or anything?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's like... I think two cables. One is the thick one we were talking about, and then there's a thinner one.

Agent: Okay, the thinner one might be a phone line. That's separate. But the thick coaxial cable is the main one we need. Let me try resetting the modem from here. This is going to take about three to five minutes. I'm going to send a signal and it should reboot the device on our end. Can you hang tight with me?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've initiated that reset. You should see the modem restart in a moment. The lights might go dark and then come back on.

Customer: (pause) Oh, yeah, the lights just went off. They're coming back... there's the orange light again.

Agent: Right, and that's what we want to see. That orange light means it's trying to establish a connection. Give it another minute or so.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... (pause) ...nothing's changing. It's still orange.

Agent: It's still stuck on orange. Hmm. Let me check something. Are you able to see outside your window to where the cable line comes into your house? Is there any damage or anything loose out there that you can see?

Customer: I can try to look, but, uh... (pause) I don't really know what I'm looking for. Everything looks normal from what I can see.

Agent: That's okay, I was just checking. So here's what I'm seeing on my end. The modem is still not showing as active on our network. And honestly, with that orange light staying constant like that, and the reset not helping... I think what we might be dealing with is either a problem with the line itself coming into your house, or possibly a hardware failure with the modem.

Customer: Oh no, really? So what do I do?

Agent: Well, I have a couple options for you. We could schedule a technician to come out and check the line and potentially replace the modem if that's the issue. Or, if you happen to have another modem available to test with, we could try that.

Customer: I don't have another modem. How long would it take to get a technician out?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Let me check our availability... The earliest we have is tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I guess that would have to work. I need to get back online for work though.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm going to schedule that for you right now. You'll get a confirmation email within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. Tomorrow morning, right?

Agent: That's correct. Between 8 AM and noon. And just to recap for you, we've tried restarting both the modem and router, we've checked all the connections, and we've attempted a reset from our end, and unfortunately the modem isn't establishing a connection. So the technician will be able to investigate further and get you back up and running.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Is there anything else before we end this call?

Customer: No, that's all.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications. We'll see you tomorrow morning. Have a good day.

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
