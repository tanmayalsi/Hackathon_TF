# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of, and it's still not working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get this sorted out for you. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this for service at 2847 Maple Street?

Customer: That's right, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. So your internet is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely. Like, nothing's connecting. My WiFi isn't showing up on any of my devices, and I tried plugging directly into the modem with an ethernet cable, and still nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful that you've already tried that. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you seeing any lights on the modem at all? Like, is it powered on?

Customer: Um, yeah, let me look... I'm looking at it right now. So I've got the power light is on, it's green. But, uh... (pause) I think the internet light is red? Or maybe orange? It's kind of hard to tell in this lighting.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on, but the internet indicator is showing red or orange. That tells me the modem is powered on but it's not connecting to our network. Let me ask you this—did you have any storms in your area recently, or any power outages?

Customer: No, no storms that I know of. Power's been fine. It just... it just stopped working. I was literally just using it this morning, everything was fine, and then I came home from work and it was gone.

Agent: Alright, let me try a few things here. First, I want you to unplug the modem from power—just pull the power cable right out. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Yeah, doing it now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Let's leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds while I check a few things on my end. (pause) How are we doing?

Customer: Still unplugged. This better work because I really need to get online. I've got work stuff I need to do tonight.

Agent: I completely understand. (typing sounds) Okay, and while we're waiting, do you happen to know if there have been any recent changes to your setup? New devices, anything moved around?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I mean, my roommate has some stuff connected, but that's been the same for months.

Agent: Got it. Alright, go ahead and plug that modem back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) It's coming back on... I see the lights starting to come back...

Agent: Okay, give it about a minute to fully boot back up. While that's happening, I'm going to check if there are any service outages in your area. (typing sounds) Let me just... (pause) Alright, I'm not seeing any active outages on our end, so that's good news.

Customer: Okay, so like, it should be working then?

Agent: Well, let's see how those lights look now. What are you seeing?

Customer: Um... power's still green. But the internet light, it's... it's still showing that same red or orange color. It's been like, what, a minute now?

Agent: Yeah, give it just another thirty seconds or so. Sometimes they take a bit longer to establish connection. While we wait, let me ask—have you restarted your modem recently before today?

Customer: Uh, not that I remember. Maybe like a month ago?

Agent: (pause) Alright, it might not hurt to do that periodically. Are those lights looking any different now?

Customer: (pause) No... still the same. This is weird.

Agent: Okay, it does sound like there might be a connection issue between your modem and our network. Let me try something else. Can you look at the back of the modem for me? I need you to check if the cable coming in from outside the house is securely connected. It should be screwed in pretty tight.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me look... yeah, I'm looking at it. Um, it looks like it's connected, but like... (pause) ...actually, wait. Is it supposed to be screwed on really tight? Because I can like, I can wiggle it a little bit.

Agent: Okay, so it might be a little loose. Can you try tightening it for me? Just turn it clockwise—like, hand-tight is fine, don't force it too hard.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm tightening it... yeah, it's definitely tighter now.

Agent: Good. Give it another minute or two now and let's see if that helps.

Customer: (pause) ...Alright, um, I'm looking at it and... (sigh) ...nope. Still red. Or orange. Whatever that is.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Let me check something on my account here. (typing sounds) So, I'm looking at your service history and I'm not seeing any recent issues flagged. But something might be happening at the network level that's not showing up yet. Let me ask you this—when you look outside your house, do you see the cable line coming to your house? Is it intact? You're not seeing any damage or anything?

Customer: Uh, I mean, it's dark outside, but from what I can see... I don't think so? I mean, there's the line running to the box on the side of the house. Looks normal to me.

Agent: Alright. And just to cover all the bases here, have you tried connecting to the WiFi since we rebooted the modem?

Customer: No, I didn't think it would help since the internet light is red, but... (pause) ...let me try. (pause) Yeah, the WiFi isn't showing up at all. Nothing.

Agent: (pause) Okay. I think what might be happening here is there could be an issue with the line coming into your house, or potentially with the modem itself. I want to be honest with you—this is beyond what I can troubleshoot over the phone.

Customer: Really? So like... what do I do then?

Agent: So here's what we can do. We can schedule a technician to come out and take a look. They'll be able to check the line, check all the connections, and if it is the modem, they can swap that out for you as well. How does your schedule look?

Customer: (frustrated) Ugh, I don't know. When would they be able to come out?

Agent: Let me check availability. (typing sounds) I'm showing that we have availability tomorrow between 1 PM and 5 PM, or we have another window on Thursday morning from 8 AM to 12 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon works, I guess. I mean, it's not ideal, but I need this fixed.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get you scheduled for that. So that's tomorrow, between 1 and 5 PM. Can I confirm the address one more time? 2847 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all the details. The technician will also call you about an hour before they arrive, just so you know they're on the way. Is there anything else I can help you with tonight?

Customer: I mean... no, I guess not. I just hope they can actually fix it.

Agent: I'm pretty confident they'll get you sorted out. I apologize that we couldn't resolve this over the phone, but our techs are really good at these kinds of issues. They'll take great care of you.

Customer: Alright, thanks I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm sorry you're experiencing this. Your confirmation details are going to that email on file. Have a good night.

Customer: Yeah, you too.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.
