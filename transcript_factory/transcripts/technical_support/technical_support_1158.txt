Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet just went out like an hour ago, and I can't get it back on. I've tried unplugging the modem and everything, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this for the service address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you noticed any lights on your modem or router currently?

Customer: Uh, yeah, actually. The modem has a red light on it. It's usually blue, I think.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Red light typically indicates there's a connection issue. Let's try a few things here. First, I want you to unplug the modem from the power source. Can you do that now?

Customer: (background noise of movement) Yeah, give me a second. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we wait, let me ask—do you have a separate router, or is it all in one unit?

Customer: Uh, separate. I've got the modem and then the router.

Agent: Got it. Let's leave the modem unplugged for about thirty seconds. While we're waiting, have you noticed any storms in your area recently? Or any physical damage to the line outside?

Customer: No, no storms or anything. I mean, it was fine this morning when I was working from home. Then around noon it just... stopped. No warning or anything.

Agent: (pause) Okay, thirty seconds should be about up. Go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: (background noise) Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) The lights are... okay, the power light came back on. It's blinking amber now, and then... (pause) ...still red.

Agent: Still red. Alright, that's not ideal. Let me check on our end if there are any service issues in your area. (typing sounds) Let me put you on a brief hold while I check the network status. It should just be a moment.

Customer: Okay.

(hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, which means this is likely an issue specific to your line or equipment. Let me try a few more things. Can you tell me—when was the last time your modem was restarted before today?

Customer: I have no idea, honestly. Months ago? Maybe longer. I just... it usually works fine.

Agent: That's pretty normal. So what I'd like to do is restart the modem through a factory reset. Now, this will take about five to ten minutes for everything to come back online. Are you okay with that?

Customer: Yeah, sure. How do I do that?

Agent: Okay, so on the back of the modem, there should be a small reset button. It's usually recessed, so you'll need something like a paperclip or a pen tip to press it. You're gonna hold it down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (background noise of searching) Okay, yeah, I see it. Here we go... (pause) I'm holding it... and... done.

Agent: Perfect. Now the modem should be resetting. You'll see the lights going through a sequence—they might all go off and then come back on. This is normal. Let's wait about five minutes for it to fully boot up. In the meantime, can you also unplug the router and keep it unplugged?

Customer: Uh, sure. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. So while we're waiting, just out of curiosity—have you made any changes to your setup recently? New devices, moving the modem, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. Same setup I've had for like... two years maybe.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. (pause) So we should be getting close to the five-minute mark. Can you check the modem for me? What are the lights showing now?

Customer: (pause) Um, the power light is solid blue now. That's good, right? But the internet light... it's still red.

Agent: (pause) Hmm, the internet light is still red even after the reset. That's... okay, that's concerning. Let me try one more thing here. I'm going to send a restart signal to your modem from our end. This should take about a minute. Just stay on the line.

Customer: Okay. (background noise of movement)

Agent: (typing sounds) All right, sending the signal now...

(pause)

Customer: Still red.

Agent: Still red. Okay. And just to clarify—you're seeing the modem lights, but the internet light specifically is remaining red. You're not getting any internet connectivity on any of your devices?

Customer: Right, nothing. I can't connect to Wi-Fi, I can't... I mean, I'm assuming the ethernet wouldn't work either.

Agent: [inaudible] ...yeah, that would likely be the same issue. Okay, so what I'm seeing here is that the modem is powering on just fine—the blue light confirms that—but we're not getting a valid connection signal. This typically indicates either a line issue outside, a provisioning problem on our end, or unfortunately, a failing modem.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is there something else I can try?

Agent: Well, I wish I had better news, but at this point, I think we need to get a technician out to your location to do an on-site diagnosis. It could be an external line issue, which we'd need to investigate, or it could be the modem needs replacement.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet for work tomorrow.

Agent: (pause) I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) The earliest I'm showing is... a technician can come out tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I guess that'll have to work. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Like, any other troubleshooting steps?

Agent: Honestly, I think we've exhausted the basic steps. You could try one more time—make sure both the modem and router are unplugged, wait a full minute, and plug them both back in and see if anything changes. But I'd be surprised if—

Customer: (interrupting) But if I already did that once...

Agent: Right, exactly. You'd probably just get the same result. I think your best bet is to wait for the technician tomorrow. They'll be able to test the line and the equipment properly.

Customer: Okay. So you're scheduling that for tomorrow morning, 8 to 12?

Agent: That's correct. I'm going to send a confirmation email to the address on file, and you should receive a text message as well with the appointment details. The technician will be able to call you thirty minutes before they arrive.

Customer: All right. Thanks, I guess. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize we couldn't get it working today. Our technician tomorrow should be able to get to the bottom of this quickly. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's... no, I think that's it.

Agent: Okay. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good night.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
