# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed today if possible.

Agent: I understand, and I'm sorry you're experiencing that. I'll definitely do my best to help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account information? What's the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Hutchins.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, James. I see you here. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Just to confirm, you're not getting any connection at all right now, correct?

Customer: Right, nothing. The modem's lit up, it's got some lights on it, but my WiFi isn't showing up on my phone and nothing's connecting.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you take a look at your modem? I need you to tell me what lights you're seeing on the front of it.

Customer: Um, there's a power light that's on, it's green. Then there's like a... an internet light maybe? That one's actually not on. And then there's... I think it says like "online" or something?

Agent: Alright, so the power is on but the internet light isn't illuminated. That's actually the issue we need to address. Do you see any lights that are blinking or red?

Customer: No, no red ones. Just the one green light for power. Everything else is kind of dark.

Agent: Okay, thank you for checking that. Here's what I'd like you to do. I need you to unplug the modem from the power source. Just pull the plug out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, done.

Agent: Great. Now hold on for about 30 seconds, and I'll come back to you.

Customer: Sure, no problem.

(pause, background noise)

Agent: Alright, welcome back. Now go ahead and plug the modem back in.

Customer: (pause) Plugged it back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now we're going to give it about a minute to boot back up. While that's happening, do you have a separate router or are you using just the modem?

Customer: I think it's just one unit. It's a modem with WiFi built in, I believe.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. That's actually our newer model, so that's good. Let me just check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your account and I do show that there was a service interruption in your area around 45 minutes ago. Did you happen to see any notice about that?

Customer: Oh, no, I didn't get anything. But wait, so it's an outage? Like, the whole neighborhood?

Agent: It could be. Let me check the status. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like it was resolved about 15 minutes ago, but your modem may not have reconnected yet. How are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Um, let me see... still just the green power light. The internet one... no, it's still not on.

Agent: Hm, that's unusual. Okay, let me try something else. Can you locate the reset button on the back of your modem? It's usually a small recessed button.

Customer: (pause) I'm looking... oh, I see it. Yeah, there's a little tiny button back here.

Agent: Okay, don't press it yet. That's a full factory reset and we don't want to do that unless we absolutely have to. Um... let me think here. (pause) Do you have any other devices at home that you can try connecting to? Just to see if it's the modem or something else?

Customer: Yeah, let me try my laptop. (pause) Okay, I'm... no, I'm not seeing the WiFi network at all. It's not even broadcasting.

Agent: Right, so the modem isn't putting out a signal. That indicates the modem itself might not be fully online. (typing sounds) Let me check the line coming into your house. Can you tell me... do you see any cables or anything running into where your modem is? Like, is there a wall outlet or anything?

Customer: There's a coaxial cable. I know that term because I looked it up online. (laughs) That's plugged in.

Agent: (laughs) Good, good. Okay, so that's the cable line coming in. Can you check to make sure that's firmly connected? Maybe give it a gentle tug to confirm it's seated properly?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's in there pretty good. Seems fine to me.

Agent: Alright. You know what, James, I've got to be honest with you. It sounds like the modem may have been affected by that outage and possibly needs to be reset or even replaced. I'm not getting a signal back on my end either, which is strange. Can I put you on a brief hold while I check with my supervisor?

Customer: Yeah, okay. How long do you think?

Agent: Just a couple of minutes. I really appreciate your patience.

(hold music, approximately 2 minutes pass)

Agent: Alright, James, I'm back. I spoke with my supervisor and here's what we're going to try. I'm going to send a signal to your modem remotely. This might take a few minutes to process.

Customer: Okay, I'm waiting.

(pause, typing sounds)

Agent: Alright, so I've sent that through. Do you see any change in the lights at all?

Customer: (pause) No, nothing. Still just the power light.

Agent: (pause, sigh) Okay, that's concerning. The modem isn't responding to the remote signal, which tells me that it might be in a state where it's not communicating with our network at all. Have you had any issues with the modem recently? Any power surges or anything like that?

Customer: Not that I know of. It's been working fine up until today.

Agent: Right. Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I think at this point the modem may be defective. The outage we had earlier could have damaged it. Let me see what options we have for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so we can definitely send you a replacement modem, but given that you need this today, I think our best bet is to schedule a technician visit. They can bring a replacement and make sure everything is installed and configured properly.

Customer: How soon can a technician come out?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) Unfortunately, the earliest I'm showing for your area is... it looks like next Tuesday. So that would be three days from now.

Customer: Three days? That's... I really need my internet before then. I work from home and I need it to send emails and everything.

Agent: I completely understand, James, and I really wish I had a sooner opening. Let me see... (pause) Okay, so another option is, we can expedite a replacement modem to you via mail. Typically that takes 3 to 5 business days, but let me add a note here to see if we can get it to you faster.

Customer: So you're telling me I have to wait either three days for someone to come out or five days for a modem in the mail?

Agent: I know this is frustrating, and I'm really sorry we don't have better options available right now. There's been quite a bit of weather-related service issues in your area, so our technician schedule is pretty packed at the moment.

Customer: This is really disappointing. Is there anything else we can try to get it working?

Agent: (pause) You know what, let me have you try the factory reset I mentioned earlier. It's a bit of a last resort, but maybe that could reinitialize the modem and get it back on the network.

Customer: Okay, sure. Let's try that.

Agent: Alright, so you're going to press and hold that small reset button on the back of the modem for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm pressing it... holding... (pause) It's starting to do something. Some of the lights are flickering now.

Agent: Great! That's a good sign. Go ahead and release the button.

Customer: (pause) Okay, released it. The lights are still flickering. It looks like it's rebooting or something.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give it about a minute and a half to fully reboot. (pause) How's that looking?

Customer: (pause) Um, okay, so the lights seem to have settled down but... no, I'm still just seeing the power light. The internet light is still off.

Agent: (pause, frustrated sigh) Alright, James. I think that confirms that it's not a software issue. The modem physically isn't connecting to our network. So we're back to the technician visit or the replacement modem in the mail being your options.

Customer: Are you sure there's not a technician available sooner? Can you check again?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check one more time for you. (pause) No, the earliest is still Tuesday. I really wish I had better news.

Customer: Okay, well... can you at least add a note to my account or something? So if there's a cancellation I can get in sooner?

Agent: Absolutely, I can do that. I'm going to note that this is urgent and that you work from home. If there's any opening, they'll definitely reach out to you. And in the meantime, we're also going to rush that replacement modem. Let me make sure I have the right address here... (pause, typing sounds) Okay, 447 Maple Street. Is that still correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: And the phone number? Is 555-0147 still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yes, that's fine.

Agent: Alright. So to recap, I've scheduled a technician visit for Tuesday, and I've submitted a rush request for a replacement modem. You should get tracking information for the modem via email and text within the next 24 hours. The technician will also reach out to you before they come out to confirm the time.

Customer: Okay. I mean, I'm not happy about waiting, but thank you for at least trying to help.

Agent: I know this isn't ideal, James, and I'm truly sorry we couldn't get you back online today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I'll just have to figure something out for the next few days.

Agent: I really do apologize. If you have any questions or if anything changes, please don't hesitate to call us back. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Alright, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye, James. Take care.
