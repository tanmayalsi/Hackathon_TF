# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet went out this morning and I've been without service for like two hours now. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Okay, David. I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So your internet just stopped working this morning, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I was working from home and everything was fine, and then around 9 AM it just... died. The modem, it's not showing any lights or anything.

Agent: Alright, that's helpful information. Before we dig too deep, let me ask you a couple quick things. Is the modem plugged in?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, of course it's plugged in. It's right here next to my router.

Agent: (chuckles) I know, I know. I have to ask. Okay, so no lights at all? Not even a power light?

Customer: No. Nothing. It's completely dark.

Agent: Got it. Let's try a power cycle. Can you unplug the modem from the wall outlet for about thirty seconds and then plug it back in?

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) Yeah, I'm gonna wait... now I'm plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Once you plug it back in, it should take about two to three minutes to fully boot up. You should see some lights come on first—usually a white light on the power indicator.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing... yeah, I'm seeing a white light now. That's good, right?

Agent: That's perfect! That means it's getting power. Now let's wait for it to fully boot. Usually you'll see a green light on the internet connection indicator once it's fully online. That typically takes about two to three minutes.

Customer: Alright, I'm waiting. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it now... I see the white power light, and there's an orange light next to it, but it's not green.

Agent: (pause) Okay, the orange light means it's still trying to establish a connection. Let's give it just a little bit more time. Is the orange light... is it solid or is it blinking?

Customer: It's blinking. It's blinking kind of slowly.

Agent: Okay, that actually might just mean it's still connecting. Let's give it another minute or so. (pause) While we wait, have you had any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: Um, no. The weather's been pretty nice today actually. Why?

Agent: Just checking. Sometimes that can cause connection issues. (pause) How's that light looking now?

Customer: Still orange. Still blinking.

Agent: Hmm. (typing sounds) Let me check something on my end. One second... Okay, so I'm not seeing your modem coming online in our system, which is strange. Let me ask you this—did anything change with your setup recently? Any new equipment, or did someone do any work at your house?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Everything's been the same for months.

Agent: Alright. Let's try another troubleshooting step. Can you check the cable that goes from the wall outlet into the modem? Sometimes those can get loose.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Hold on, let me look. (pause) Yeah, I'm checking it now... it looks pretty secure to me. Wait, let me just... (pause) ...actually, let me unplug it and plug it back in real quick.

Agent: Good idea.

Customer: Okay, it's back in. (pause) Still the same thing though. Orange blinking light.

Agent: (pause) Alright, David. Let me try resetting the modem. Can you hold down the reset button—it's usually on the back of the modem—for about ten seconds?

Customer: The reset button? Um, hold on. Let me find it. (pause) Okay, I see it. It's this tiny little button back here. (pause) I'm holding it... ten seconds, right?

Agent: Yeah, ten seconds should do it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm letting go now. (pause) So now the lights are off again... (pause) ...and now they're coming back on.

Agent: Great. Let's see what happens. How are the lights looking?

Customer: (pause) White power light again. And now... now the orange light is back. It's blinking again.

Agent: (pause) Okay. (typing sounds) I'm looking at this on my backend, and I'm still not seeing your modem register in our system. This is... let me try something. Do you have a second modem or router you could try?

Customer: No, I just have the one setup. (pause) So what does it mean that I'm not showing up in your system?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be a signal issue from our equipment at the street level, or it could be something going on with the modem itself. (pause) What I'm thinking is that we might need to send a technician out to check the line. But before we do that, let me see if there's anything else I can try from my end.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need my internet. I have calls I need to make for work.

Agent: I completely understand. So if we were to schedule a technician, they could typically come out sometime later this week. Let me check what's available... (typing sounds) But first, let me try one more thing. Can you tell me exactly what model modem you have? It should say on the label.

Customer: (pause) Uh, it says... Frontier... something... it says "FibeRack 3000" I think? Or... wait, maybe it's FibeRack 3000X?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I'm checking the specifications on that model. Okay, so that's one of our standard modems. (pause) Alright, let me try one more thing. I'm going to send a refresh signal to your line. Just give me a moment.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) (pause) Alright, I've sent that through. Can you tell me if anything changed with the modem?

Customer: (pause) Nope. Still the same. White light, orange blinking light.

Agent: (pause) Okay. (sigh) I hate to say this, but I think we're at the point where we need to get a technician out there. The modem's not establishing a connection with our network, and I've gone through all the basic troubleshooting steps I can do remotely.

Customer: So there's nothing else you can try?

Agent: I wish there was, David. At this point, it seems like it's either a hardware issue with the modem or there's something on the line side that's preventing the connection. The technician will be able to dig deeper and test everything. (pause) Do you want me to go ahead and schedule that for you?

Customer: (frustrated) Yeah, I guess. I don't really have a choice. When's the soonest someone can come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. (pause) It looks like we have an opening on Thursday between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Thursday? That's two days away. Isn't there anything sooner?

Agent: Let me check tomorrow... (pause) Unfortunately, tomorrow's completely booked in your area. Thursday is the next available slot.

Customer: (pause) Okay, fine. Thursday afternoon. What time should I expect someone?

Agent: The window is 1 to 5 PM, and you should receive a courtesy call about thirty minutes before the technician arrives. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got that scheduled for you. Your appointment is Thursday, August 15th between 1 and 5 PM. The appointment number is 847392.

Customer: Okay. August 15th, 1 to 5 PM. Got it.

Agent: Perfect. Is there a contact number I should have on file to reach you if the technician needs to?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my main line.

Agent: Perfect, that matches your account. David, I really apologize that we couldn't get this resolved right now. I know it's inconvenient to be without internet.

Customer: Yeah, well. Hopefully the technician can figure it out Thursday.

Agent: They should be able to. They'll have access to the full line and can test everything. If there is still an issue, they can replace the modem or work on the line as needed. (pause) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope Thursday comes soon.

Agent: I completely understand. Thank you for being so patient with me today, David. We really appreciate your business. Have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye.
