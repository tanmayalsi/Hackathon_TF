# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me just... okay, I've got it here. I'm seeing an account for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Uh, I'd say around 8 or 8:30. I tried turning the router off and back on, but nothing. Still nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's good that you already tried that. Let's take a couple more troubleshooting steps here. First, can you tell me what you're seeing on your modem right now? Are there any lights on it?

Customer: Um... (pause) let me go look at it. (background noise of footsteps) Okay, so I see... there's like a red light on it. Just one red light.

Agent: A red light, okay. And do you know which light that is? Is it on the power button, or...?

Customer: I think it's like... it's the internet light? Or the connection light? I'm not great with this stuff, to be honest.

Agent: No worries, that's what I'm here for. So if the internet light is red, that typically means we're not getting a signal to your modem. Let me ask you this—are there any outages in your area that you're aware of?

Customer: Not that I... I mean, I didn't see anything on the website or anything, no.

Agent: All right. Well, let me check our system here to see if there are any known issues. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm not showing any active outages in your zip code, so that's a good sign. Let's try a different approach. I'm going to have you do a hard reset on your modem. Can you unplug it from the power outlet?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause, background noise) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds. That'll let the system fully reset.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...30 seconds or so?

Agent: Yeah, that should be good. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) Now I'm watching it and... nothing's happening yet. Should something be happening?

Agent: Yeah, you should start seeing some lights come on. The power light should come on first, then after about a minute or so, you should start seeing other lights. Let me just... let me check the connection on our end real quick. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not showing any connection from your modem yet. How long has it been?

Customer: Maybe like... 45 seconds?

Agent: Okay, give it another minute or so. Sometimes these modems take a bit to fully boot up. In the meantime, can you just verify for me that all your cables are plugged in securely? There should be a cable coming in from outside, and then cables going into your modem from the wall outlet.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at this and... yeah, I see one cable coming from the wall, and then there's like a coaxial cable or whatever coming in from outside through the wall. Both of those look pretty tight to me.

Agent: Okay, good. And you can see where that outside cable is coming from? Do you see any physical damage to it at all?

Customer: No, I mean... it looks fine to me. It's just like a regular cable.

Agent: All right. And the modem—is it powered on now? Are you seeing any lights?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm seeing like... the power light is on now, it's green. But that red light is still there.

Agent: Okay, the red light is still on. That's... that's not ideal, but let's keep troubleshooting. Have you rebooted your computer at all?

Customer: Well, no, but my phone isn't connecting either, so I don't think that's the issue.

Agent: Yeah, no, that's a fair point. Okay, so we're still not seeing a connection from your modem on our end. Let me try something here. I'm going to send a refresh signal to your modem and see if that helps establish the connection.

Customer: Okay, yeah, do whatever you need to do.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) All right, I've sent that through. Can you just watch your modem and let me know if anything changes?

Customer: (pause) Um... I don't think so. The lights are kind of the same. The red light's still there.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. I'm still not picking up a connection on my end either. When you say you saw the internet go down this morning, did you do anything differently? Like, did you restart the modem, or was there a power outage, or anything like that?

Customer: No, I just... I was working from home and it was just working fine, and then I went to check something online and it was just... gone. No warning or anything.

Agent: And you haven't had any power issues or storms or anything overnight?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been clear all morning.

Agent: All right. This is... let me be honest with you, this sounds like it might be an issue on our end, possibly with your line coming in from outside, or it could be an issue with the modem itself. I've tried resetting it, I've sent a refresh signal, but we're still not seeing a connection being established.

Customer: So what does that mean? What do we do?

Agent: (pause) Well, I have a couple options. We could try replacing your modem—I could have a new one sent out to you, but that would take a few business days. Or, if you have time, I could schedule a technician to come out and physically inspect your line and your equipment. They'd be able to come by and check everything out in person.

Customer: How long would that take? To get a tech out here?

Agent: Let me check availability. (typing sounds) What does your schedule look like? Are you available tomorrow?

Customer: Um... I mean, I work from home, so I'd need my internet back, but yeah, I could be here. When would they come?

Agent: Okay, so tomorrow we have a... let me see here... (pause) we have an available appointment between 1 and 3 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I could do that.

Agent: Perfect. All right, so I'm going to go ahead and schedule that for you. In the meantime, is there anything else you want me to try? I can... I mean, we could try a few more troubleshooting steps, but honestly, with the modem not connecting to our network at all, I think a technician visit is probably your best bet.

Customer: No, I think that's fine. I mean, I appreciate you trying, but it sounds like it's not something I can fix from here.

Agent: I understand. I really do apologize that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. So you're all set for tomorrow, 1 to 3 PM. The technician will have all the information about your account. Just make sure someone's home, and they should be able to get you back online.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I'll be here. Is there anything I should do between now and then?

Agent: Just leave the modem plugged in as is. Don't try any more resets or anything like that. The tech will handle everything tomorrow. And if you happen to see any change—like if the internet suddenly comes back on—just give us a call and let us know so we can cancel the appointment.

Customer: Will do.

Agent: All right, Robert, I really appreciate your patience today, and I'm sorry we couldn't get this sorted out immediately. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
