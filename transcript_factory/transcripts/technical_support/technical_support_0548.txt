# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet's been out since this morning and I can't figure out what's going on. I've got work calls coming up and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Uh, yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Okay, I'm looking at... perfect, I've got you here. So your service went down this morning, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 AM. I was just sitting here, and suddenly everything just... stopped.

Agent: Got it. And are you seeing any lights on your modem right now? Can you look at the router for me?

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) let me go grab it. (background noise of footsteps) Okay, I'm looking at it now. So there's a green light, and then there's a red light that's blinking. That can't be good, right?

Agent: Okay, so we're getting somewhere. The red blinking light usually indicates a connection issue. Let me have you do a quick power cycle. Can you unplug the modem for me?

Customer: Sure, unplugging it now. (sound of unplugging)

Agent: And let's wait about 30 seconds while that powers down completely.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been unplugged.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Done.

Agent: Perfect. Now this is going to take a couple minutes to fully boot back up. While we're waiting, have you noticed any unusual activity or any recent storms in your area?

Customer: No storms, nothing like that. The weather's been fine. Actually, now that you mention it, there was a crew working on the lines down the street yesterday. Could that be related?

Agent: (typing) Hmm, that's definitely worth noting. Let me check our system for any maintenance activity in your neighborhood. (pause) I'm seeing some scheduled maintenance yesterday evening, but nothing that should have affected your service. How many minutes would you say have passed?

Customer: I don't know, maybe... two minutes?

Agent: Okay, we're getting close. What I'm seeing on my end is that your modem is registering on our network, which is a good sign. Let me have you check those lights again for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so now I've got... the green light is still there, but the red one is... still blinking. It's maybe blinking a little slower? I'm not sure if that means anything.

Agent: Yeah, it should be fully solid green when it's working properly. Let me try something else here. Are you comfortable accessing your router settings? We can try resetting the connection from there.

Customer: Uh... (hesitation) I mean, I'm not super tech-savvy, but I can try. What do I need to do?

Agent: No problem. Can you go to your computer or phone and look for the WiFi networks available?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I've got my laptop here. (typing sounds) I can see my Frontier network showing up in the list.

Agent: Okay, and can you try connecting to it?

Customer: (pause) I'm trying now... (pause) it's loading... no, it's not connecting. It says "can't connect to this network." So that's definitely not working.

Agent: Alright. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds, longer pause) I'm seeing... okay, so the modem is connecting to our network, but there seems to be an authentication issue. This could be a few things. Let me try resetting the modem completely.

Customer: Wait, will that affect my settings? I don't even know what my password is anymore.

Agent: That's actually something we can help with. Once we reset it, we can help you set everything back up. Can you locate the reset button on the back of the modem? It's usually a small button you'd need to hold with a pen or paperclip.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's a tiny little button on the back.

Agent: Perfect. Hold that down for about 10 seconds. This will completely factory reset the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it down... (pause) alright, I'm letting go. Everything just went dark.

Agent: That's exactly what should happen. Now let's give it another minute or two to come back online. (pause) While we're waiting, I'm just going to note here that we've tried the basic troubleshooting steps. If this reset doesn't resolve it, we may be looking at a hardware issue or something upstream on our network side.

Customer: (pause) How long should this take?

Agent: Should be any second now. (pause) Do you see the lights coming back?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, the green light's on again. The red one is also on. And they're both blinking now, which is different from before, I guess?

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me just pull up our diagnostics one more time. (typing sounds, pause) I'm not getting a good read on the connection stability. Here's what I think might be happening—either there's an issue with the modem itself that's preventing a stable connection, or there's something on our network side that's blocking your service.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, let me try one more thing. I'm going to send a refresh signal to your modem from here. This might take a few minutes, so just let me know what happens.

Customer: (long pause, background noise) Okay, still just got the same lights.

Agent: Alright, I've sent that through. (pause) Unfortunately, I'm not seeing the connection stabilize. At this point, I think what we're dealing with is potentially a hardware failure on the modem, or there could be a network issue that would require a technician to come out and check the line at your location.

Customer: Are you serious? How long would that take? And how much is it going to cost me?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing) We do have a technician available tomorrow between 1 and 4 PM. Since you're experiencing a complete service outage, there shouldn't be any service call charge for this visit. We'll either replace the modem or identify the issue with the line.

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need this today. I have important calls.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, today's slots are completely booked. Tomorrow is the earliest we can get someone out. But I will make sure this is flagged as a priority.

Customer: (sigh) Okay... yeah, fine. Schedule it for tomorrow then.

Agent: Perfect. I've got you down for tomorrow, 1 to 4 PM window. Is the phone number on file the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yes, that's fine.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly. In the meantime, if anything changes—if the internet suddenly comes back online—just let us know. And if you have any other questions before the technician arrives, don't hesitate to call us back.

Customer: Alright, thanks. I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

Agent: Thank you for your patience today, and again, I apologize we couldn't get this resolved remotely. We'll get you up and running tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
