# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Marcus. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. My internet just went out completely and I have no idea what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. Can I get your name to verify the account?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. I was working from home and just... nothing. The router's on, the modem's on, but there's no connection at all.

Agent: Okay, I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me ask you a few quick questions to help troubleshoot. First, can you tell me what color the lights are on your modem right now?

Customer: Um, let me look... (pause) The power light is green, and there's a... there's like a red light on the port where the internet cable goes in.

Agent: Okay, so the red light on the internet port—that actually tells me the modem isn't receiving a signal from our network. Before we go further, have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: First time. It was working fine this morning, and then around two o'clock it just stopped.

Agent: Got it. And have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yes, that would be helpful. Go ahead and unplug it for about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. I'll hold here.

Customer: Okay. (sounds of movement, unplugging) It's unplugging now. (pause) Alright, I'm plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, it's restarting... the lights are cycling through... (pause) Still just that red light on the internet port.

Agent: Alright, still the red light?

Customer: Yeah, still red.

Agent: Okay. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area right now, and your account shows active service. Can you check where your modem is positioned? Sometimes it's a cable connection issue.

Customer: It's in my living room, by the TV. The cable is... I'm looking at it now... it looks pretty secure. But let me trace it. It goes from the wall to the modem and... (pause) actually, there's a coax splitter here. Looks normal to me.

Agent: Okay, and do you see the cable where it comes out of the wall? Can you check if it's tight?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm checking... (sounds of movement) Hmm, it's pretty tight. Wait, actually... let me try to tighten it a little more. (pause) I'm trying... okay, it's as tight as I can get it. The red light is still there though.

Agent: Still showing red?

Customer: Yeah.

Agent: Alright, let me try a couple more things. Can you unplug the modem one more time and wait a full minute this time? And while we're waiting, let me ask—have you noticed any physical damage to the cable? Any cuts or pinches?

Customer: (unplugging sounds) Okay, waiting now. (pause) I'm looking at the cable... I don't see anything obvious, but the cable does kind of bend sharply behind the entertainment center. I could pull it out a bit if you want.

Agent: Yeah, let's try that. See if you can gently pull that cable out so it's not kinked.

Customer: (sounds of shuffling) Okay, I've got it pulled out now. It's straightened out. Should be better. (pause) Alright, thirty seconds... forty-five... a minute. Let me plug it back in. (pause) Okay, it's back on... lights are cycling... (pause) Nope. Red light again.

Agent: Still red?

Customer: Still red.

Agent: Okay, David. (pause) I want to be honest with you—that red light usually means either the cable is damaged or there's an issue on our network side at your location. Since we've tried the basics and the cable appears to be okay, I think we might be looking at either a line issue or the modem itself might be defective.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you guys fix it?

Agent: So here's what I can do. I can schedule a technician to come out and check the line coming into your house. They can test it, check for any damage, and verify everything on our end. Alternatively, we could try replacing the modem, but I'd recommend the tech visit first to rule out a line issue.

Customer: How long would that take? I need my internet for work.

Agent: I understand. Let me check availability. (typing sounds) We have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have Thursday afternoon from 1 to 5 PM.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. But is there anything else we can try right now?

Agent: Let me think... (pause) You could try one more thing. If you have a different ethernet cable lying around, you could try connecting directly from the modem to a computer, just to eliminate any router issues. But I have to be honest, with that red light on the modem, it's almost certainly not a WiFi problem.

Customer: Yeah, I don't think I have another cable, but... I mean, if there's no internet signal coming in, that wouldn't help anyway, right?

Agent: No, you're right. I don't think it would in this case. Alright, let me get you scheduled for that technician visit. Can you confirm your address?

Customer: It's 447 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing) 447 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B. Got it. So I'm scheduling you for tomorrow, [inaudible], between 8 AM and 12 PM. The tech's name will be... (pause) looks like it'll be James. He'll call you about fifteen minutes before he arrives.

Customer: Okay, thank you. Is there anything I should do with the modem in the meantime?

Agent: You can leave it as is, or you can leave it unplugged just to save power. Either way is fine. The tech will have tools to diagnose what's going on.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate your help, Marcus. I know you tried.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today, David. But hopefully James will have you back online tomorrow morning. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye.
