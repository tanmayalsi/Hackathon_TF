Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. My internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up and running. I work from home and this is kind of a problem.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I see your account here. So your internet service is down completely? Can you tell me a little bit more about what's happening? Like, do you see any lights on your modem or router at all?

Customer: Well, um... (pause) let me look. So the modem is just sitting there and... no, there's no lights. It's completely dark. Like, nothing's lit up at all.

Agent: Okay, so the modem is completely dark. That typically means it's not getting power. Let's try a couple of things here. First, can you check the power cable? Is it plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's plugged into the outlet. I can see the outlet and everything. But wait, let me... let me check if the outlet itself is working. Do you have a lamp or something you can plug in just to test the outlet?

Customer: Oh, actually, I do have a lamp here. Let me... (background noise of movement) ...yeah, the lamp turns on, so the outlet is working fine.

Agent: Good, good. Okay, so the outlet's fine. Now, the cable that's connecting to the modem—can you unplug that for me and just take a look at it? Make sure there are no bent pins or any visible damage?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm looking at it now. Um... (pause) ...no, it looks fine. The cable looks normal to me. No bent stuff or anything.

Agent: Alright. Let's try a power cycle. Go ahead and unplug the modem from the power outlet, and let's leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. Just count it out for me.

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) Unplugging it now. (pause) One... two... three... (pause) ...this is gonna take a while, huh? (pause) ...twenty-eight... twenty-nine... thirty. Okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. Now, let's give it about two to three minutes to boot back up. While we're waiting, let me ask you—have you had any storms in your area recently? Or any recent construction or anything like that?

Customer: Hmm, not that I can think of. I mean, there was some wind yesterday, but nothing crazy. No storms or anything.

Agent: (pause) Alright, so... do you see any lights on the modem now? Has anything lit up?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. It's still completely dark. Is that... is that normal?

Agent: No, it's not. The modem should have at least some indicator lights by now. Let me try something else. Is there possibly a battery backup unit or a surge protector involved here? Like, is the modem plugged directly into the wall, or is it going through something else?

Customer: It's going through a surge protector. Is that a problem?

Agent: That shouldn't be a problem, but let's eliminate that variable. Can you try plugging the modem directly into the wall outlet?

Customer: (pause) Okay, give me just a second... (background noise) ...alright, I've got it unplugged from the surge protector and plugged directly into the wall. (pause) ...and still nothing. Still no lights at all.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. (pause) I'm going to check something on my end here. Let me see if we're showing any service issues in your area. (typing sounds, pause) ...no, everything looks good on our end. No outages reported at your location.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, what it typically means is that the issue is probably with the modem itself. Either it's not receiving power, which we've ruled out, or there might be a hardware failure. Do you happen to remember how old that modem is?

Customer: Uh... (pause) ...I think I got it a few years ago? Maybe three or four years? I'm not totally sure.

Agent: (pause) Okay, um... let me try one more thing before we go down that road. Sometimes there's a reset button on the modem. Do you see a small button, maybe recessed, on the back or bottom of the unit?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... (background noise) ...yeah, actually I do see a button. It's like a tiny little hole.

Agent: Perfect. You'd need a paperclip or something thin to press that. That's the reset button. Let me have you press and hold that for about ten seconds.

Customer: Okay, I'm grabbing a paperclip. (pause) (background noise) Alright, I'm pressing it... (pause) ...holding it... (pause) ...ten seconds... (pause) ...and I'm letting go. (pause) Anything?

Agent: Any lights yet?

Customer: (pause) No. Still nothing. This is really weird.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I'm... I'm concerned that the modem may have experienced some kind of hardware failure. I know this is frustrating. (pause) Let me transfer you over to our equipment support line. They have some additional tools they can use to diagnose this. But before I do that, can I get a callback number in case we get disconnected?

Customer: It's the same number as the account. 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, I'm going to transfer you now. Just hold tight for just one second here.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) Thank you for your patience.

(hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Thanks for waiting. Unfortunately, the equipment team is unavailable at the moment, but they'll be reaching out to you within the next two hours. They should be able to set up a replacement modem for you or schedule a technician visit if needed.

Customer: So I just... wait for them to call?

Agent: Yes, they'll reach out to you at that callback number. In the meantime, if anything changes or you need anything else, feel free to give us another call.

Customer: Alright. I guess that's it then. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get this sorted out for you as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
