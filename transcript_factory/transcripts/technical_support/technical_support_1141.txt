# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I work from home and I have calls coming up.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account really quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account under the name James Mitchell. Is that you?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Walk me through what happened. Did you notice anything before it stopped working?

Customer: Not really. I was working this morning, everything was fine, and then around 9:30 I tried to load a page and nothing. Just... nothing loaded. So I waited a bit thinking maybe it was just slow, but after like ten minutes I realized something was actually wrong.

Agent: Okay, understood. Let me ask you a few quick questions. First, do you have a modem and a router, or do you have a combined unit?

Customer: Um... I think it's separate? I have like a box with lights on it, and then a separate router with the WiFi.

Agent: Good, that's helpful. I'm looking at your service here and you should have our Frontier Quantum Gateway modem. It's a white box, kind of rectangular. Does that sound right?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I think so. It's white and has a bunch of little lights on the front.

Agent: Perfect. So here's what I'd like you to do. Can you go ahead and look at those lights for me right now? Tell me which ones are lit up or blinking.

Customer: (pause) Okay, give me just a second... (background noise of footsteps) Alright, so I'm looking at it now. Um, there's a power light that's solid green. Then there's one that says... I think it says "Internet" and that one is... it's not on. It's dark.

Agent: That Internet light being dark is definitely the issue. Okay, so what I want you to do is unplug the modem from the power outlet. Just pull the cable out completely.

Customer: Okay... (pause) ...done.

Agent: Good. Now I want you to wait for about 30 seconds. While you're waiting, can you also unplug your router?

Customer: Oh, you want me to unplug both of them?

Agent: Yes, exactly. That'll help us reset everything. Go ahead and unplug the router too.

Customer: (pause) Alright, both are unplugged now.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's wait about 30 seconds. (pause) While we're waiting, have you experienced any issues with your service in the past, or is this the first time something like this has happened?

Customer: No, first time actually. The service has been pretty solid since I got it installed about eight months ago.

Agent: That's good to hear. Okay, 30 seconds should be up. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first. That's the main box.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, it's plugged in. I see the power light came back on.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it about a minute to fully boot up. While that's happening, go ahead and plug the router back in as well.

Customer: (pause) Router's plugged in now too.

Agent: Excellent. This usually takes about a minute or two. Let's just wait a moment and see if that Internet light on the modem comes back on. (pause) Do you see it starting to light up at all?

Customer: Hmm... no, not yet. It's still dark.

Agent: Still dark, okay. Um, let me think here. (pause) Can you also look at your router and tell me what lights are showing on there?

Customer: Yeah, so the power light is on. The WiFi light is on. But I don't see any... I'm not sure what the other lights mean, but some of them are blinking. Not all solid.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay. That's somewhat normal during startup. Let's give it another minute or so and see if everything stabilizes. While we're waiting, I'm going to check a few things on my end. (typing sounds) Have you noticed any other devices in your home having connectivity issues, or is it just the internet not working entirely?

Customer: I mean, nothing's connected right now because there's no internet. I tried my phone on WiFi and couldn't get anything. But I got LTE working on my phone, so I can at least send messages.

Agent: Good thinking. Okay, so... (pause) I'm going to be honest with you. I'm not seeing any issues on our end in your area. Your service is active, I'm not seeing any outages or anything like that. Sometimes this can indicate an issue with the modem itself or possibly the line coming into your house.

Customer: Oh, so like... hardware failure?

Agent: It could be, yeah. Or it could be something with the connection outside. Um, can you check one more thing for me? Do you know where your outside box is? Your network interface device? It's usually where the line comes in from the street.

Customer: Uh... I'm not really sure. I mean, I know where the cable comes into my house, but I don't know what you're talking about with the box.

Agent: That's okay, that's okay. It's usually a small box mounted on the side of your house or in a closet. But, um... (pause) Let me try one more thing first. Can you look at your modem again? That Internet light—is it showing any activity at all now?

Customer: (pause) No. Still off. This is frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand. I wish I had better news. Let me see here... (typing sounds) So here's where we're at. I've walked you through the standard reset procedure, which usually resolves these issues about 80 percent of the time. But since that hasn't worked, it's likely we're dealing with either a hardware issue with the modem or a problem with the line connection itself. Unfortunately, that's something that would require a technician to come out and diagnose in person.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need to get online soon.

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (pause, typing sounds) What area are you in? Are you in the city or...?

Customer: I'm in Springdale, kind of on the north side.

Agent: Okay, Springdale north side. Let me look at our scheduling system here. (longer pause, typing) So I'm seeing that we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or later tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 6 PM. We also have a slot on Friday morning.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. Let me do tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. I can get you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 and 12. There would be a service call fee of $89.99 unless this turns out to be a service issue on our end, in which case that would be waived. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I mean... it has to work, doesn't it? What choice do I have? Yeah, let's do it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me get some information from you. Is the number we have on file 555-0147 still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell.

Agent: Perfect. So a technician will call you tomorrow morning around 8 AM just to confirm they're on their way. They'll arrive sometime between 8 and noon. Just to make sure, do you have easy access to both the inside and outside of your house for the technician?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I'll be home all day anyway since I have no internet. (laughs nervously)

Agent: (slight chuckle) Right, yeah. Hopefully we'll get you back up and running soon. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: Um... just to confirm, there's nothing else I can try myself before tomorrow?

Agent: (pause) Well, the only other thing I might suggest is trying another power outlet. Sometimes if there's an issue with the outlet itself, moving the modem to a different one can help. But honestly, given that the Internet light isn't coming on at all, I don't think that'll resolve it. This really does sound like something that needs hands-on troubleshooting.

Customer: Alright, I'll try it anyway, but I'm not very hopeful.

Agent: I don't blame you. And look, I'm going to add a note here that you're a work-from-home customer who's down and out of service. Just so the tech is aware and can prioritize getting you back online. 

Customer: I appreciate that.

Agent: So to recap, you're all set for tomorrow morning between 8 AM and noon. A tech will call to confirm. Your reference number for this service call is 447821. You might want to write that down.

Customer: 447821. Got it.

Agent: Great. And James, I'm really sorry you're dealing with this today. Hopefully we'll have you back up and running tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. I hope so too.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye.
