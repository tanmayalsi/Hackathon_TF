Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: It's... uh... (pause) 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I see you're a Fiber customer in the Sunnyvale area, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Alright. So your internet service went down this morning. Have you experienced any outages recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, no. First time in like... I dunno, months? This is really unusual. I've got my work laptop here and I can't do anything.

Agent: I totally understand. Let's troubleshoot this together. First thing—can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the modem powered on? Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Yeah, the modem's on. I can see... there's a power light that's green, and then there's like a red light that's blinking on the top. I think it's the internet light?

Agent: Okay, so the power light is green—that's good. The red blinking light on top is typically the internet connection light, so that would indicate we're not getting a signal to your modem right now. Have you tried power cycling it yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Go ahead and unplug the power cable from the back of the modem. Just hold on one second while you do that.

Customer: (sounds of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now just leave it unplugged for about 30 seconds. While we wait, can you tell me—have there been any recent storms or weather in your area? Or any construction or maintenance work going on?

Customer: (pause) No, I don't think so. It's been pretty clear out. Why, does that matter?

Agent: It can sometimes. Occasionally we have fiber line damage from weather or outside work. (pause) Okay, 30 seconds should be up. Go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Alright, it's back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now it's going to take a minute or two to boot back up. While that's happening, can you check your router as well? Is that powered on?

Customer: Yeah, the router's on. It's been on the whole time. No lights are coming on though.

Agent: Right, that would make sense because it's not getting any internet signal from the modem. (pause) Okay, so we're waiting for the modem to boot up. Go ahead and check on it now—what are you seeing?

Customer: (pause) Um, still red. Still blinking red.

Agent: (pause) Okay, still red. Alright, let me try a few other things. Can you see where the fiber line connects to your modem? It's usually a small thin cable.

Customer: Oh, yeah, I see it. It's, uh... yeah, it's connected. The little plug thing is in there.

Agent: Good. Can you just double-check that it's fully seated? Sometimes it can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) I'm pushing on it. Seems pretty tight to me.

Agent: Okay, that's good. And you're not seeing any damage to the fiber cable itself? No cuts or anything?

Customer: No, it looks fine from what I can see.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your line status right now, and... hmm. (pause) Yeah, we're not seeing any signal coming from your address. Have you by chance noticed any loose cables or equipment outside the house? Near your front door or wherever the fiber line enters?

Customer: I... I don't think so? I haven't really looked. Do I need to?

Agent: It wouldn't hurt to check. Sometimes a connector can come loose or something can get disturbed. But just be careful. Don't touch the fiber cable directly—just see if anything looks visibly disconnected or damaged.

Customer: (sound of movement) Okay, I'm going outside... (pause) I don't see anything obviously wrong out here. Everything looks pretty connected to me.

Agent: Alright. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check with our network team to see if there's anything going on in your area. This should just be a minute.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So the network team says everything looks good on our end in your service area. There are no outages or maintenance windows scheduled for today.

Customer: So what does that mean? Why isn't my internet working then?

Agent: That's a good question. So at this point, it seems like the issue might be with either the modem itself, the fiber connection at your address, or possibly the fiber line coming from the street. Since we're not getting any signal and your modem isn't connecting, I have a couple of options for you.

Customer: Okay, like what?

Agent: Well, we can dispatch a technician to your address to do a full inspection and see what's going on physically. That way they can test the equipment, check the fiber line, and hopefully get this resolved for you. Or, if you want, you can try a few more things, but honestly at this point it sounds like it might need a tech visit.

Customer: How long would that take? When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what our availability looks like. (pause) We have some openings tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have afternoon slots between 1 and 5 PM. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow? Can't someone come out today?

Agent: Unfortunately, today is pretty booked up. Our next available same-day window would be... (pause, typing) ...not until around 6 PM this evening. Would that work?

Customer: (pause) I mean... that's pretty late, but... (frustrated sigh) Yeah, I guess that's better than waiting until tomorrow. I need to get this working. I've got a presentation I need to work on.

Agent: I completely understand. So I'm going to set you up for a technician visit today between 6 and 8 PM. There will be a service fee of $99 for the same-day service call. Is that okay?

Customer: A service fee? Like... I have to pay for this?

Agent: So typically, if it's a line issue or something on our side, we would waive that fee. But since we haven't been able to identify an outage or a network issue, there would be a charge for a technician visit. However, once the tech gets there and determines what the problem is, they'll be able to let you know if the fee applies or gets waived.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I just... I need my internet back, so... let's do it.

Agent: Great. Let me just confirm all your information here. We have you at 1247 Maple Drive, Sunnyvale, and a callback number of... (pause) 555-0847?

Customer: Yeah, that's all correct.

Agent: Perfect. So your appointment is confirmed for today, 6 to 8 PM. You should receive a text confirmation shortly with those details. The technician will take a look at everything and hopefully get you back online. Is there anything else I can help you with while you're waiting?

Customer: No, I think... I mean, I guess that's it. I just hope they can fix it.

Agent: I hope so too. I know this has been frustrating. We really appreciate your patience, and we'll get this sorted out for you today.

Customer: Alright, thanks Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you this evening.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
