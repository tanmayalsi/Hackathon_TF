Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, so my internet just went out about an hour ago and I'm not really sure what's going on. I've restarted my router a couple times but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I grab your account information real quick? I'll need your phone number or account number.

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. And just to confirm, you're not seeing any internet connection at all right now, correct?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. My phone's connected to my mobile data, so that's why I can call you. But the WiFi is completely down.

Agent: Okay, so you have tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in?

Customer: Yeah, I did that twice actually. The first time I waited like five minutes, the second time just a couple minutes. It's still not working.

Agent: Alright, that's good you tried that. Let me check a few things on our end here. (pause) (typing sounds) So I'm not seeing any service outages in your area, which is a good sign. That usually means it's something we can troubleshoot together.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that's good to hear.

Agent: So let's start with the basics. When you look at your router right now, what color are the lights on it?

Customer: Um, let me go grab it... (background noise) Okay so it's... the power light is on, it's like a solid green. But the internet light... it's blinking red.

Agent: Okay, the red blinking light—that typically indicates a connection issue between your router and our network. Have you checked that all the cables going into the back of the router are securely plugged in?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... yeah, they look pretty tight to me. There's like the power cable, the ethernet cable from the modem...

Agent: Right, so you have a modem as well?

Customer: Yeah, there's a modem box and then the router next to it.

Agent: Okay, and what color lights are you seeing on the modem?

Customer: Um, hold on. The modem... let's see. It's got like a green light on the front, and then there's like an orange one that's blinking.

Agent: Alright, so green is good on the power, but that orange blinking light on the modem is telling me there might be a connection issue on that end. Can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just wait about thirty seconds for me. (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (background noise) Plugged back in. (pause) It's... it's booting back up. The lights are flashing. (longer pause) Okay, still booting...

Agent: That's normal, it can take a minute or so to fully restart. Just give it about two more minutes and then we'll see if that orange light goes away.

Customer: Alright, I'm waiting... (pause) Two more minutes, okay.

Agent: While we wait, let me ask—have you had any recent storms in your area? Sometimes that can affect the equipment.

Customer: No, actually, the weather's been pretty nice all day. No storms or anything.

Agent: Good to know. Alright, so it's been about two minutes now. What are you seeing on the modem?

Customer: Okay, let me check... (pause) Um, so the green light is still solid, but the orange one is still blinking. That's still not good, right?

Agent: No, unfortunately that's not the status we want to see. Okay, let me... (typing sounds) let me try a few things from our end here. I'm going to send a signal to your modem to see if we can reset the connection remotely. Can you keep watching the lights for me and just let me know if anything changes?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Hmm, nothing yet... (longer pause) Nope, still the same.

Agent: Alright, I'm not seeing any response from the modem on my end, which suggests there might be a deeper connectivity issue. Let me try something else. I'm going to have you do a full factory reset on the modem. This will clear everything and set it back to default. To do this, you're going to look at the back of the modem and find a small reset button—it might be recessed.

Customer: A reset button... (pause) Okay, I'm looking... I see it. It's like a tiny little button in a hole.

Agent: That's the one. You'll need something thin like a paperclip to press it. Just hold it down for about ten seconds.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (background noise) I'm getting a paperclip... (pause) Alright, I'm pressing it. (pause) Okay, still holding... (pause) Ten seconds is up.

Agent: Perfect. Now it's going to restart. Let's wait and see what happens with those lights.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's restarting. All the lights went off for a second... and now they're coming back on. (longer pause) I'm still seeing that orange blinking light though.

Agent: Hmm, that's frustrating. Okay, so the fact that the modem isn't connecting after that reset tells me there might be an issue with the line coming into your house, or possibly the modem itself needs to be replaced. (pause) Let me check one more thing. Can you tell me what model modem you have? There should be a label on the front or back.

Customer: (pause) Let me see... it says "Frontier FX2000."

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so that's one of our standard models. Let me see if I can identify any issues on the line side... (longer pause) So, I'm not detecting a strong signal coming from our network to your location. That could mean there's a problem somewhere between our equipment and your house, or it could be that the modem is failing.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, what do I do?

Agent: Well, I have a couple of options for you. First, we can schedule a technician to come out and check the line and the equipment. They'd be able to visually inspect everything and figure out exactly what's wrong. That would probably be the fastest way to get you back online.

Customer: How long would that take? When could they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... (pause) We have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and noon if that works for you. Or we have another slot on Thursday afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. Yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Excellent. I'm going to get you scheduled for that. Before we finalize that though, is there anything else we can try real quick? Sometimes it's the simplest things...

Customer: I mean, I feel like we've tried everything. The reset, unplugging it, checking the cables...

Agent: Yeah, I think we've covered the basics. And honestly, with that weak signal I'm seeing, I think we're going to need the tech to take a look at the line. (pause) Alright, so I have you down for tomorrow, Tuesday, September 12th between 8 AM and noon. A technician will come out to your location. You should get a confirmation text and email with all the details.

Customer: Okay, great. Is there anything I should prepare or do before they arrive?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home to let them in. Keep the modem and router plugged in—don't try any other resets tonight. And if you think of anything else that might be relevant, just let the tech know when they arrive.

Customer: Alright, sounds good. I appreciate your help, Marcus, even though we couldn't get it working.

Agent: I appreciate your patience, and I'm sorry we couldn't resolve it over the phone today. But our technician will definitely get to the bottom of it tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's everything.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow morning. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
