Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went down about two hours ago and I've tried everything I can think of. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing an outage. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what name is this account under?

Customer: James Richardson.

Agent: Perfect, James. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Alright, I see you're on our Fiber 200 plan in the Denver area. Can you tell me what you're experiencing exactly? Is there no internet connection at all, or is it just running slowly?

Customer: No internet at all. Like, nothing. All the lights on the modem are... well, actually, I'm not sure what they should be doing. Let me look at it again. (pause) There's a red light on the front. Is that bad?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. A red light typically indicates there's an issue with the connection. Let me walk you through a few troubleshooting steps. First, can you locate your modem and your router? Are they separate devices or is it a combo unit?

Customer: They're separate. I've got the modem right here and the router is... over there on the shelf.

Agent: Great. So let's start with the modem. I want you to unplug the power cable from the back, and then wait about thirty seconds. Can you do that for me?

Customer: Uh, yeah, sure. (sounds of movement) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) Thirty seconds, right? (pause) Alright, it's been a minute. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug it back in now. While that's powering back up, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Can you tell me... have you noticed any issues with your service recently? Any outages or slow speeds?

Customer: No, not really. It was working fine this morning. I was working from home and everything was perfect, and then around... I don't know, maybe 2 o'clock, it just stopped.

Agent: Okay. And no storms or anything in your area that might have affected the lines?

Customer: No, it's actually been pretty nice outside. Clear skies.

Agent: Alright. (pause) So the modem should be booting back up now. Can you tell me what color the lights are? Are they still red or have they changed?

Customer: (pause) Um, let me see. There's... there's a couple of blinking lights now. There's a white one and then the red one is still on. Is that normal?

Agent: The white blinking light is good—that means it's trying to establish a connection. The red light should go away once it fully connects. Let's give it about another minute or two to fully boot up. While we wait, let me ask—do you have a laptop or phone you could try connecting to? Just to test if there's any signal at all?

Customer: I could try my phone. Let me see... (pause) Yeah, I'm not seeing our Wi-Fi network at all.

Agent: Okay, that's actually a good clue. That means the router isn't broadcasting. So what I'd like you to do is unplug the router as well. The one on the shelf. Let's do the same thirty-second reset on that.

Customer: Okay, give me a second. (sounds of movement) Alright, it's unplugged. I'm starting the timer now. (pause) Thirty seconds is up. Plugging it back in. (sounds of plugging in)

Agent: Good. While that's booting up, I'm going to check your account to see if there might be a service issue in your area. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure, no problem.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, then returns) Thanks for holding, James. I'm not seeing any major outages reported in your area, which is good news. Let me ask you—when you look at the modem now, what's the status of those lights?

Customer: Uh... (pause) okay, so the modem now has like, a white light that's steady, and the red one is gone. So that's better, right?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. That's much better. The steady white light means the modem has connected. Now for the router, you should start seeing your Wi-Fi network appear. Have you checked your phone again?

Customer: (pause) No, nothing yet. Should I wait longer?

Agent: Yeah, let's give it another thirty seconds or so to fully boot up and start broadcasting. Why don't you check your phone again in just a moment?

Customer: (pause) Okay... still nothing. That's weird. (pause) Wait, actually... let me go look at the router. The lights on it... one of them is blinking but really slowly. Like, super slow. Is that okay?

Agent: (pause) Hmm, that's... that's not ideal. A slow blinking light could indicate a few different things. Let me ask—do you see any lights that are solid, or are they all blinking?

Customer: There's one that's solid... it looks blue. And then the other one is blinking red.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to be honest with you, James. That blinking red light on the router suggests there might be a communication issue between the modem and the router. Let me try one more thing. Are they connected with an ethernet cable?

Customer: Yeah, there's a yellow cable going from the modem to the router.

Agent: Perfect. Can you check and make sure that cable is firmly plugged into both ends? Sometimes it can come loose.

Customer: (sounds of movement) I'm looking at the modem end... it looks pretty snug to me. Let me check the router end. (pause) Same thing, looks tight. I can try unplugging and replugging it if you want?

Agent: Yes, actually, that's a great idea. Go ahead and do that.

Customer: (sounds of unplugging) Okay, it's out. (pause) Now I'm plugging it back in... (sounds of plugging in) It's in.

Agent: Alright. Let's give it a moment to re-establish that connection. (pause) Any changes to the router lights yet?

Customer: (pause) Um... no, actually it looks the same. Still that slow blinking red light and the blue one.

Agent: (sigh) Okay, James. I'm going to be straightforward with you—I think we might be looking at a hardware issue with your router. The fact that the modem is connecting properly but the router isn't receiving or distributing the signal suggests the router might be failing.

Customer: Oh man, really? So what do I do?

Agent: Well, I have a couple of options for you. First, I could schedule a technician to come out and diagnose the issue. They could repair or replace the router, depending on what they find. Or, if you have any other ethernet-connected devices, you could try connecting directly to the modem with the ethernet cable to see if the internet works that way. That would at least confirm the issue is the router and not something else.

Customer: I don't really have another device I could plug in right now. When could a technician come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) The soonest I can get someone out to you would be tomorrow between 10 AM and 2 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Really? I was hoping... I mean, I work from home. I kind of need this today.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry. Unfortunately, today we're pretty booked up. But tomorrow morning is really the earliest availability. I can put you on a priority list and have them call you before they come, just to confirm everything.

Customer: (pause) Yeah... okay, I guess that's fine. I'll have to figure something out for today.

Agent: I really appreciate your patience, James. Is there anything else I can try right now, or should we go ahead and schedule that technician?

Customer: No, I think we've tried everything. Let's schedule it.

Agent: Perfect. So I have you down for tomorrow, 10 AM to 2 PM window, at 555-0147. The technician will call you thirty minutes before arrival. There's no charge for this visit since it's a hardware issue. Do you have any other questions for me?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, anyway.

Agent: You're welcome, James. I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online today, but we'll have this resolved for you tomorrow. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a great day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
