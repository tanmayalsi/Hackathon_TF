# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account pulled up here. I can see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. So your internet just went out this morning, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, it just stopped working around 8 AM. I tried unplugging the modem and router but nothing's helping.

Agent: Okay, that's a good first step that you already tried. Let me ask you a few questions. Is the modem showing any lights right now? Are any of them lit up?

Customer: Uh, let me look at it. (pause) Yeah, there's a few lights. There's a red one blinking and... I think there's an orange one? Or maybe it's yellow? I'm not sure exactly.

Agent: Okay, so there's definitely activity there. That's good. Is it the light on the left side that's red?

Customer: Um... (pause) Yeah, I think so. Hard to tell with these things.

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, I know what you mean. Okay, the red light typically indicates there's an issue with the connection. Let me check our system here. (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages in your area right now, so let's try a few things. Can you try power cycling the modem for me? Unplug it and wait about 30 seconds, then plug it back in.

Customer: Sure, hold on. (pause) Unplugging it now. (pause) Okay... waiting... (longer pause) It's back on. Now what?

Agent: Great. Give it about a minute to fully boot back up. While we wait, let me ask—have you experienced any recent power outages or storms in your area?

Customer: Actually, now that you mention it, we had a pretty bad storm last night. Power flickered a few times.

Agent: Okay, that could be it. Sometimes power surges can affect the modem. (pause) Alright, is the modem back up and running now?

Customer: Um, yeah, it looks like it. The lights are... they're still doing the same thing though. Red light's still blinking.

Agent: Hmm. Let me try something else. Can you unplug the power cable from the modem again and also the battery backup if you have one?

Customer: Battery backup? I don't think I have one of those.

Agent: That's okay, we don't always include those. Just the power cable then. Go ahead and unplug that and wait for me.

Customer: (pause) Done. Now what?

Agent: Leave it unplugged for a full minute this time. I'm going to pull up some diagnostics on my end. (typing sounds) I'm checking the line to your address to see if there's any issues there.

Customer: Okay. (pause) How much longer should I wait?

Agent: Almost there. Give it another ten seconds... and go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it in. (pause) Okay, it's booting back up.

Agent: Let's see... (pause) Are you able to see any lights coming on now?

Customer: Yeah, green lights now. That's good, right?

Agent: That's a very good sign actually. Can you try connecting to your WiFi on your phone or a computer? See if you get any internet connection?

Customer: (pause) Trying now on my phone... (longer pause) No, nothing. Still nothing. The WiFi network shows up, but it won't connect to the internet.

Agent: Okay, so you can see the network but no connection. Let me check this on our backend. (typing sounds) Hmm. (pause) I'm not seeing an active connection to your modem right now. That's strange because the lights were green...

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could mean a few things. It could be an issue with the line coming into your house, or there could be a problem with the modem itself. Let me ask you—when you go to the modem, is there a cable coming out of the wall into it?

Customer: Yeah, there's a cable in the back of it. It's all plugged in.

Agent: Can you check that it's fully seated? Sometimes if they come loose, that can cause connection issues.

Customer: (pause) I'm checking... it seems pretty secure to me. Like, it's snug.

Agent: Okay. And that cable, does it have a little filter or a splitter on it?

Customer: Um... I don't know what that looks like?

Agent: No problem. Is there anything between where the cable comes out of the wall and where it goes into the modem?

Customer: No, it goes straight in.

Agent: Good. Alright, let me try one more thing. Can you access the modem's settings? Do you know how to do that?

Customer: I mean... not really? How would I do that?

Agent: You'd go to your computer and open a web browser and type in 192.168.0.1, but if you can't connect to the internet, that won't help anyway. (pause) I'm sorry, James. I'm looking at this from my end and I'm not seeing any signal coming into your line at all.

Customer: So what does that mean for me? Like, is it the modem that's broken?

Agent: It could be, but honestly, without a signal reaching your line, the modem can't establish a connection even if it's working perfectly. This is looking more like it might be an issue with the external connection—the fiber line to your house or the equipment at our end.

Customer: So I can't fix this myself?

Agent: I don't think so, unfortunately. What I'm going to need to do is schedule a technician to come out and check the external connection. They'll be able to test the fiber line coming to your house and see if there's been any damage from that storm last night.

Customer: How long is that going to take? When can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) How about tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM? Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need this fixed today.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me see if there's any same-day appointments available. (pause, longer pause) Unfortunately, all our technicians are booked for same-day service. Tomorrow between 12 and 4 is the earliest I can get someone out.

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, okay. I guess that'll have to work. This is really inconvenient though.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me get your contact information to confirm this appointment. Is 555-0147 still the best number to reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. So we have James Mitchell, account ending in 0147, for a technician visit tomorrow between 12 PM and 4 PM to diagnose the connection issue. The technician will have all the information, but just to summarize—we're not seeing an active signal coming to your line, so they'll check everything from the street to your modem.

Customer: Okay. And if it is the storm damage, will that cost me anything?

Agent: That's a good question. If it's damage to our equipment on the street or the fiber line itself, there'd be no charge. If it's something inside your home or the modem itself, we'd need to discuss that with you. But let's see what the tech finds first.

Customer: Alright. So tomorrow, 12 to 4. Got it.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully they can fix it tomorrow.

Agent: I really hope so too. Thank you for calling Frontier, James, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
