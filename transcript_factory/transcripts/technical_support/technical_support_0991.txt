Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I work from home and I have a meeting in like an hour.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got you here. So your internet service went down this morning? Do you remember what time that happened?

Customer: Uh, probably around 7:30 or so. I was just trying to check my email and nothing was loading.

Agent: Alright. And just to confirm—you're not able to connect on any of your devices right now, or just one?

Customer: No, nothing. My laptop, my phone... even the WiFi on my smart TV isn't working. So it's definitely the internet itself.

Agent: Okay, that's good information. That tells me it's likely something with your modem or the connection coming into your home. Have you tried unplugging the modem and router yet? Sometimes a quick restart can fix these kinds of issues.

Customer: No, I haven't actually. Let me... where is it? It's in the closet. (background noise of rummaging) Okay, I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. Just give it about thirty seconds while it's unplugged.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been about thirty seconds.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in. While it's booting back up, can you tell me—are you seeing any lights on the modem? Any red lights or anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, there's... let me look. There's a red light on the power button right now. Is that bad?

Agent: The red light on the power should turn green once it fully boots up. That should just take a minute or two. While we're waiting, have you noticed any outages in your area recently, or is this the first issue you've had?

Customer: No, first time really. I've had Frontier for like two years and it's been pretty solid until now.

Agent: That's good to know. Okay, have the lights on your modem changed at all?

Customer: (pause) Uh... the power light is still red. But there's like... is there supposed to be another light that's blinking? Like a white one or something?

Agent: Yes, there should be. When the modem boots up, you should see a power light that's green or solid, and then a few other lights that might blink—those indicate internet connectivity and such. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing right now?

Customer: Just the red power light. Everything else is... I don't see anything else.

Agent: (pause) Okay. And the modem's been unplugged and plugged back in for... what, a few minutes now?

Customer: Yeah, at least a couple minutes, yeah.

Agent: That's unusual. Typically it should be booted by now. Let me ask—when you look at the back of the modem, do you see all the cables plugged in securely? The power cable, the coax cable from the wall?

Customer: (background noise) Okay, let me check. The power cable looks good. And, um, the other cable—the thick one from the wall—yeah, that's plugged in too.

Agent: Good. Sometimes those can come loose. Um... let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) I'm not showing any service outages in your area, so that's not it. Can you try unplugging the modem one more time, just for a full minute this time? And while you do that, let me also have you try your router separately.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Unplugging now. So I have one of those combination modem-router units, is that what you mean?

Agent: Oh, that's actually helpful information. So it's all one device. Alright, yeah, let's just do the full restart on that unit then. One minute... and you can go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, plugging it back in. (pause) And... still just the red light.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. This is... let me think here. Can you tell me—when you look at the unit, does anything look damaged or unusual about it? Any burn marks or anything?

Customer: No, it looks fine to me. It's not hot or anything.

Agent: Alright. Let me try a different approach. Can you try holding down the reset button on the back? It might be a small button you have to use a paperclip or pen for. That'll fully reset the device to factory settings.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, I'm looking... yeah, I see a reset button. (pause) I'm pressing it. How long do I hold it?

Agent: About ten seconds should do it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, letting go. Now what?

Agent: Now let's wait another minute or two and see if that helps it boot up properly.

Customer: (pause) Still just the red light. Come on... (frustration evident)

Agent: I understand. This is frustrating. Unfortunately, at this point, what we're seeing typically indicates a hardware issue with the modem itself. The fact that it's not booting past that red light even after a reset usually means the device needs to be replaced.

Customer: Are you serious? So it's just... dead?

Agent: It appears so, yes. I'm sorry. The good news is we can get you a replacement device shipped out right away. You should have it within three to five business days, and it would be covered under your service agreement.

Customer: Three to five days? I need my internet today. I have work to do. Can I... can I pick one up somewhere or have someone come out?

Agent: (pause) Let me check what options we have available. (typing sounds) Unfortunately, we don't have any in-store pickup locations in your area, but I can put in a request for expedited shipping. It might get to you in two business days instead of five. As for a technician visit, we do have same-day and next-day appointments available, but there would be a service charge associated with that.

Customer: How much are we talking?

Agent: [inaudible] ...would be $99 for a same-day appointment.

Customer: (frustrated sigh) ...That's... okay, but then couldn't the technician just replace it anyway?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. If you get the same-day service call, they would bring a replacement modem with them and install it on the spot.

Customer: Alright. Let me think about this... I really need to get this working today. Yeah, let's do the same-day appointment.

Agent: I appreciate it. Let me check availability for you. What's your address?

Customer: 447 Maple Street, Apartment 3B.

Agent: (typing sounds) And what time works best for you today? I'm seeing availability between noon and 6 PM.

Customer: Uh, I have that meeting at 8, so anywhere before 6 should be fine. The earlier the better, really.

Agent: Perfect. We have a 2 PM slot available. Can we schedule you for that?

Customer: Yeah, 2 PM works. That should give me some time to prepare.

Agent: Excellent. So we have a technician scheduled for 2 PM today at 447 Maple Street, Apartment 3B. They'll have a replacement modem with them. You'll just need to make sure someone's home to receive them.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I'll be here. Um, I have a couple questions though. Will I be charged the $99 today, or...?

Agent: That will be added to your next billing cycle. And just to confirm, you're okay with that service fee?

Customer: I guess I don't have much choice. What else do I need to know?

Agent: Just make sure you're home during that window. The technician will call you about 15 minutes before they arrive. They'll take care of the installation, shouldn't take more than 15 or 20 minutes. And you'll be back online once it's done.

Customer: Alright. And... sorry, I'm just stressed about the meeting. Is there anything I can do to get internet before then? Can I use mobile hotspot or...?

Agent: That would be your best bet, yes. If you have a cell phone with a data plan, you could create a hotspot and tether your laptop to that for the time being.

Customer: Okay, I might try that. So I'm all set then?

Agent: Yes. You're confirmed for the 2 PM appointment today. And I've noted the situation on your account. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get you back online as quickly as we can. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
