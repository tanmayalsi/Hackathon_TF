Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I work from home and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account here under the name David Chen. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. When you say it's down, are you seeing any lights on your router or modem at all?

Customer: Um... (pause) Let me look at it. It's over there. So I see... the modem has a red light on it. And the router next to it, I think that's off? Like, there's no lights on the router at all.

Agent: Okay, so the modem has a red light. That typically indicates there's no connection. And the router isn't powered on. Have you tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in?

Customer: No, I haven't done that yet. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yeah, that would be a good first step. Go ahead and unplug the modem for about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. And while we're waiting, go ahead and do the same with the router.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now... (pause) Yeah, they're both unplugged. I'm gonna count to thirty. (pause) Alright, plugging the modem back in first.

Agent: Good. And how many lights do you see on the modem now?

Customer: It's... it's lighting up. I see like four or five lights that are blinking right now. I think they're all... yeah, they're all blinking.

Agent: That's normal. They should stabilize in about a minute or two. While those are coming back up, go ahead and plug your router back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, router's plugged in now. I'm seeing lights on the router too. There's like a blue light and... yeah.

Agent: Great. So while we're waiting for everything to sync up, let me ask you—have you experienced any outages or issues in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, everything's been working fine until today. I woke up, tried to check my email, and nothing. Total dead zone.

Agent: Understood. Alright, give it another minute. Are the lights on the modem still blinking or have any of them turned solid?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it now... I see one solid light, one blinking... Actually, you know what, most of them look solid now. I see like one or two still blinking.

Agent: Okay, that's a good sign. Now let me have you check your computer. Can you try opening a web browser and going to, say, Google.com?

Customer: Sure, let me try. (pause) (typing sounds) Hmm, it's... it's loading but... no, it's not working. I'm getting like an error message. It says the connection timed out.

Agent: It timed out? Okay. Let me check a few things on our end. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm not showing any outages in your service area, so the issue seems to be localized to your equipment. Let's try a few more things. Can you tell me—are you on Wi-Fi or are you plugged directly into the router with an ethernet cable?

Customer: I'm on Wi-Fi.

Agent: Okay, let's try something. I want you to do a hard reset on your router. There should be a small hole on the back—you might need a paperclip or something to press it. Hold it down for about ten seconds. But I should warn you, this will reset your Wi-Fi settings.

Customer: Oh, um... okay. Let me find something. (pause) Yeah, I found a pen. I'm pressing it now. (pause) Okay, it's... the lights are going off. They all just shut off.

Agent: That's expected. It's rebooting now. Give it about two to three minutes to fully come back online.

Customer: (pause) Alright, so... we're waiting. Just so you know, this is kind of a problem because I've got a conference call in like thirty minutes.

Agent: I understand, and I'm going to do everything I can to get this resolved for you. While we're waiting, let me ask—has anything changed with your setup recently? New equipment, or did you move anything around?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Everything's been the same for... I don't know, like two years?

Agent: Okay. And you haven't made any changes to your Wi-Fi settings or anything on your computer?

Customer: No, nothing.

Agent: (pause) Alright, are the lights back on the router yet?

Customer: Yeah, actually they are. I see all the lights are lit up again. Let me try Google again. (pause) (typing sounds) Come on... (pause) It's still not connecting. It's still timing out.

Agent: Still timing out. Okay. Can you try one more thing for me? I want you to check if you can see your Wi-Fi network showing up.

Customer: Um, where do I... oh, okay, I see the Wi-Fi networks. Yeah, I see my network name. "CHEN-WIFI" or whatever.

Agent: Is it showing as connected?

Customer: (pause) It says... it says "connected, no internet." So it's connecting to the router but there's just no internet coming through.

Agent: That actually tells me quite a bit. The signal is going from the modem to the router, but there's no actual internet connection coming from the modem itself. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm. I'm not seeing any connectivity issues on this end, but I am showing that your service should be active and available.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It could mean a few things. It could be a problem with the modem itself, or there could be an issue with the line coming into your house. Let me have you try one more troubleshooting step. Go unplug the modem again, but this time also unplug the power from the wall outlet—not just the cable. Leave it unplugged for a full minute.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Alright, it's unplugged. I'm waiting. So what would be wrong with the line?

Agent: Could be a few things—sometimes the line outside gets damaged or there's interference. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's see if this helps first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, a minute's up. Plugging it back in now. (pause) All the lights are blinking again.

Agent: Alright, let me check my system one more time while that's booting up. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I check with our technical team to see if there's any issues being reported in your area. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Alright, I'm back. So I checked and there's nothing on our end showing any issues with service in your area. I'm going to be honest with you—based on everything we've tried, this seems like it might be a hardware issue with the modem or a line issue that I can't diagnose over the phone.

Customer: So what do I do? I need internet for work.

Agent: I know, and I'm sorry we're having trouble with this. I think at this point, your best option would be to schedule a technician visit. They can come out and check the modem and the line coming into your house to see what's actually going on.

Customer: How long does that take? When can they come out?

Agent: Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) I'm showing we have some availability tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we could do sometime next week if that doesn't work.

Customer: Tomorrow morning is... yeah, that might work. Is there anything I can try in the meantime?

Agent: Unfortunately, I think we've tried the main troubleshooting steps. I'd say just keep everything unplugged for now. When our technician comes out tomorrow, they'll be able to get to the bottom of this.

Customer: Alright, fine. Let's schedule it for tomorrow morning then.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to set that up for you right now. Your appointment is scheduled for tomorrow, March 15th, between 8 AM and noon. A technician will come out and assess the situation. You'll receive a confirmation email at the email address on file.

Customer: Okay. Is there a number they'll call or—

Agent: They should call you about an hour before they arrive, just to confirm they're on their way. That'll be on the number we have on file, which is your account number's associated phone.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: I apologize we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today, but I'm confident our technician will be able to help tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
