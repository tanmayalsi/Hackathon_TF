Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of. Nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Morrison.

Agent: Perfect, James. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Alright, I see you're on our 500 megabit fiber plan. So when you say the internet went out, is it complete—like nothing's connecting at all? No lights on the modem?

Customer: Well, the modem's got lights on it, but they're... I don't know, they're not the normal colors. The internet light is red, I think? Or maybe orange. It's definitely not the blue it usually is.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So the device is powered on, just showing a different light status. Have you tried unplugging the modem and router and plugging them back in yet?

Customer: Yeah, I did that like twenty minutes ago. Waited the full two minutes and everything. Still nothing.

Agent: Good, good. And after you plugged it back in, did you wait for all the lights to stabilize? Sometimes it takes a few minutes for everything to come back online.

Customer: I waited like five minutes. I'm looking at it right now and... no, it's still that orange or red color.

Agent: Alright. Let me check if there's anything on our end. (pause) Are you in the Tucson area, James?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: (typing) Okay, I'm not seeing any service outages in your area right now, so it's likely something specific to your equipment or connection. Let me have you try something for me. Can you check the cable connections on the back of your modem? Make sure the fiber optic cable is firmly connected?

Customer: Uh, sure. Let me... (pause) Yeah, I see the cable. It looks like it's plugged in. There's like a little clip thing on it?

Agent: Right, there's a small clip. Can you try gently pressing on that to make sure it's fully seated?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that... nothing really changed. Should I try jiggling it or something?

Agent: Um, maybe just give it a gentle wiggle, but be careful with it. Those fiber connections can be delicate. 

Customer: (pause) Okay... nope, still nothing. This is so frustrating.

Agent: I understand. Let me ask you this—do you have any other devices in your home that might be experiencing issues? Like, is your TV showing an error, or do you have any phone service through us?

Customer: No TV service, just the internet. And we use cell phones, so... no landline or anything.

Agent: Okay, that helps narrow things down. Let me have you try one more thing. I want you to hold down the reset button on the modem for about ten seconds. Fair warning though, this will erase any settings on the modem, but sometimes it clears up connection issues.

Customer: Hold on, that's going to make me have to set everything up again?

Agent: It might, yes. It will factory reset the device. But honestly, at this point, we need to see if that helps identify the issue. If it doesn't work after the reset, we'll have other options.

Customer: (sighs) Alright, I'm... I'm pressing the button now. It's very small. (pause) Okay, I'm holding it... How long was it?

Agent: Ten seconds should do it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let me just... (pause) Alright, I did it. Now what?

Agent: Now let's wait for the modem to fully restart. That should take about two to three minutes. Can you stay on the line?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: (pause) While we're waiting, can I ask when you first noticed the internet went out? Was it sudden, or did it get slower gradually?

Customer: It was pretty sudden. I was working from home, and I was on a Zoom call, and then just... dropped. My coworkers were like, "Hey, are you there?" and I had to call them back.

Agent: That's rough. Okay, so we're getting close to the three-minute mark. What's the modem looking like now?

Customer: (pause) Um... still the same orange light. It's not changing. Should it be doing something different by now?

Agent: Hmm, that's not ideal. Usually after a factory reset, you'd see the light cycle through a few different colors as it's starting up. The fact that it's staying one color suggests there might be a deeper issue. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) 

James, I'm looking at your modem's status remotely, and I'm not seeing a signal coming from your connection point. That usually means either the fiber line itself is damaged or there's an issue at the ONT—that's the device that converts the fiber signal. It might be located outside your home or in a box nearby.

Customer: Oh, so like... that's not something I can fix?

Agent: Not typically, no. That would require a technician to come out and diagnose the issue. Before we go down that road though, let me try just a couple more things. Can you check if there's a power adapter connected to your modem? Make sure it's plugged in?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's plugged into the wall, and the cord is connected to the modem. Both ends look secure.

Agent: Okay. And just to make sure—is your modem definitely a Frontier modem? Do you see our logo on it?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... Yeah, it says Frontier on the front.

Agent: Alright. (pause) I'm going to be honest with you, James. Based on what I'm seeing on my end and what you're describing, I believe the issue is with the fiber line or the ONT, which is equipment we need to service. I wish I could fix this remotely, but this one's beyond what I can troubleshoot over the phone.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long until someone can come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) I can schedule a technician to come out tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or the day after tomorrow between 1 PM and 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning is fine. I mean, I have to work, but... I need this fixed.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get you scheduled for tomorrow, 8 AM to noon. Is the best number to reach you 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Perfect. Your service call is scheduled for tomorrow. A technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive to confirm they're on the way. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help clarify?

Customer: No, I think that's... (sighs) I just hope it's a quick fix.

Agent: I understand your frustration, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Our technician will get to the bottom of it. Is there anything else I can help with today?

Customer: No, I think that's all.

Agent: Alright, James. Thanks for your patience, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. You should see that technician tomorrow morning. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
