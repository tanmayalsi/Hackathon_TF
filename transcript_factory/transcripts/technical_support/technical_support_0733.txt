# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I can't figure out what's going on. I've got work to do and I'm kind of panicking here.

Agent: I understand, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I see your account here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was, roughly?

Customer: Um, I'd say around 8:30 or so. I was trying to jump on a call with my team and nothing was working.

Agent: Okay, and are you seeing any lights on your modem or router right now?

Customer: Yeah, so the modem... let me look at it. (pause) The power light is on, that's green. But the internet light—the one that usually blinks—that's red. It's just solid red.

Agent: Alright, so solid red on the internet light. That's actually really helpful information. That typically means there's a connectivity issue between the modem and our network. Let's try a few things. First, can you unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Sure, doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we're waiting, let me ask—have you had any work done at your house recently? Any construction or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been pretty quiet, actually.

Agent: Okay, good to know. Now let's wait about 30 seconds for the modem to fully power down. (pause) You can go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) The lights are... coming back up now. There's a boot sequence happening.

Agent: Perfect. So what you should see is the power light and the internet light will cycle through a few colors while it's booting. This usually takes about two minutes. Can you give that a minute or so and then let me know when it stabilizes?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, so now the power light is steady green again, but... the internet light is still red. Still solid red.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me check something on my end here. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm looking at your modem status, and it's showing that it's not connecting to our network. That's odd. Let me ask you this—do you have any splitters on your line? Anything between where the line comes into your house and where it connects to the modem?

Customer: A splitter? Um... (pause) Actually, I think there might be one. My previous tenant had cable, I think. So yeah, there might be something up there in the box outside.

Agent: Ah, okay, that could be it. Sometimes those splitters can degrade the signal, especially if they're not high-quality splitters. Can you go check that for me? It should be in an exterior box, typically near where your line enters the house.

Customer: Alright, give me a second. (pause) I'm going outside now. (wind noise in background) Okay, I see the box. (pause) Yeah, there's definitely a splitter in here. It looks pretty old, actually.

Agent: Okay, I'd actually like to try removing that splitter temporarily, just to see if that's the issue. Can you carefully disconnect it?

Customer: Um, I don't want to break anything...

Agent: You should be fine. Just gently unscrew the connections. There should be one line going in and maybe one or two coming out.

Customer: (pause) Okay, (grunting) I got one... and there's another one. (pause) So I've got one line now coming directly from the box. Where do I connect this?

Agent: Just connect it directly to the modem. Bring that line straight into the modem's input port.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I'm doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's connected. Let me go back inside and check the lights.

Agent: Good, good. Go ahead.

Customer: (pause) (background door closing) Okay, so... the modem is rebooting again. I'm watching the lights cycle. (pause) Power light's green. And the internet light is... still red. It's still solid red.

Agent: (pause) Alright. That's... okay. Let me try something else here. I'm going to do a line test from my end. Can you stay on the line for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure, I'm not going anywhere. (nervous laugh)

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm running a test now. (pause) Hmm. The signal levels coming into your modem are actually... they're quite a bit lower than they should be. That's strange. (pause) How long have you been at this address?

Customer: About three months.

Agent: And when was the last time everything was working normally? Was it yesterday?

Customer: Yeah, actually, yesterday evening everything was fine. I was streaming and everything was great. Then this morning it just... died.

Agent: That's really unusual then. Usually we'd see degradation over time, not just a sudden cutoff like that. (pause) Let me check if there are any known outages in your area. (typing sounds, pause) No, I'm not seeing any outages. (pause) Okay, I hate to do this, but I think we might need to get a technician out there. There could be an issue with the line itself, or it's possible there's damage somewhere between our network and your house.

Customer: A technician? Like, how long would that take? I really need to get online today if possible.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds, pause) The earliest I'm showing is tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (sigh) Tomorrow? Really? I... okay, can you do earlier in the day? My morning's pretty packed.

Agent: Unfortunately, that 12 to 4 window is the earliest available for your area today. But what I can do is put you on our priority callback list. If a technician has a cancellation, we'll call you before then to see if you can come in earlier.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I guess that's better than nothing. And you're sure there's nothing else we can try right now?

Agent: (pause) Let me think... Have you tried power-cycling your router separately from the modem? Do you have an external router?

Customer: No, I'm just using the modem that came with the service. There's no separate router.

Agent: Okay, so just the modem. (pause) The signal levels are really the issue here, James. Without understanding what's causing that drop, I don't want to have you chase your tail with more troubleshooting when there might be a physical problem on the line. I think the technician visit is really the right call here.

Customer: Yeah, I understand. (pause) Alright, let's schedule that. So tomorrow, 12 to 4?

Agent: That's correct. And can I get a callback number to reach you if we have an earlier opening?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0149.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. I have you down for a technician appointment tomorrow, February 14th, between 12 PM and 4 PM, with priority callback if something opens up. The confirmation number is 847-FRT-29. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I really hope this gets sorted out tomorrow. I'm falling behind on everything.

Agent: I hear you. I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. Our technician is really good, though, and I'm confident they'll figure out what's going on. In the meantime, if anything changes, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Okay, thanks, Derek. I appreciate you trying.

Agent: Of course, James. Thanks for being patient with me today, and we'll get you back up and running soon. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
