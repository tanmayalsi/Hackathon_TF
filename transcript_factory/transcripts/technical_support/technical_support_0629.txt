# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I've got a work meeting in like an hour and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I completely understand. We'll do our best to get you back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's the main line for the house.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... I've got you, Robert Chen on Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing no internet connectivity at all this morning. Is that right? And can you tell me when you first noticed it went down?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around like... I dunno, eight o'clock maybe? I went to check my email and everything just... nothing. The modem's still on, it's got lights and stuff, but I'm not getting anything. My phone's showing no WiFi connection.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the modem is powered on. Can you look at the lights on the front of the modem right now and tell me what colors they are and if they're solid or blinking?

Customer: (pause) Uh, yeah, let me... (background noise of movement) Okay so there's like a green light that's solid on the left side. Then there's... it looks like a red light that's blinking? And then one more that's... I think it's orange and also blinking.

Agent: Okay, so we've got a solid green light, a blinking red, and a blinking orange. That's helpful. The red and orange blinking typically indicates the modem is trying to establish a connection but hasn't been successful. Have you tried power cycling the modem yet?

Customer: Power cycling? You mean like... unplugging it?

Agent: Exactly. If you could unplug it from the wall, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in, that'll often resolve connection issues. It basically gives the modem a fresh start to connect to our network.

Customer: Alright, let me do that real quick. (background noise) It's unplugged. I'm gonna count to thirty... (pause) ...okay, it's back in.

Agent: Great. And now let's give it about 60 seconds to fully boot back up. While we're waiting, have you had any recent storms or weather issues in your area? Sometimes that can affect the fiber connection.

Customer: Uh, actually yeah now that you mention it. There was some pretty heavy rain last night. I didn't think about that being related though.

Agent: That could definitely be a factor. Weather events can sometimes cause temporary disruptions. Okay, go ahead and take a look at those lights again. What are we seeing now?

Customer: (pause) Still the same. Green is solid, and the red and orange are still blinking.

Agent: Alright, still blinking. Let me check your account here for any service issues in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages on your line right now. Let me try something else. Can you check if the cable coming into your modem from the wall is firmly connected?

Customer: Oh, the cable? Yeah let me... (background noise) ...looks pretty solid to me. It's like, you know, connected in the back.

Agent: Okay. And how long have you had the modem you're using?

Customer: I'm not really sure. Couple years maybe? We got it when we switched to Frontier, so... three years?

Agent: Okay. Sometimes modems can degrade over time, especially after exposure to power surges or weather events. But let's do one more troubleshooting step. I'm going to have you do a factory reset on the modem. This will clear out any corrupted data that might be preventing connection.

Customer: Okay... how do I do that?

Agent: You should see a small button on the back or bottom of the modem that says "Reset" or it might just be a small pinhole. You'll need to use a paperclip or something thin to hold it down for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (background noise, pause) I'm looking... yeah, I see it. It's a little hole on the bottom. Okay, I'm holding it down with a paperclip. Ten seconds?

Agent: Yes, exactly ten seconds should do it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I've got it. Now what?

Agent: Now let's wait another minute or two for it to fully reboot. This'll take a bit longer than before since it's resetting to factory settings. While we wait... have you tried connecting a device directly to the modem with an ethernet cable? Just to test?

Customer: I have an ethernet cable, but uh... (pause) ...my laptop doesn't really have an ethernet port. Most laptops don't anymore, right?

Agent: That's fair, a lot of newer ones don't. Okay, let's just wait and see if the reset helped. How's it looking on the lights now?

Customer: (pause) Still... still blinking. Red and orange, same as before.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me take a different approach here. I'm going to check the modem's signal strength on my end. (typing sounds, pause) I'm actually not getting a strong reading from your modem at all. It's like it's barely registering with our network. That could indicate an issue with either the modem itself or the fiber connection coming into your home.

Customer: Oh no. What does that mean? How long is that gonna take to fix?

Agent: Well, it could be a few different things. We might need to send a technician out to check the fiber connection at your home and possibly replace the modem. Let me check availability... (pause, typing sounds) The earliest I can get someone out would be... looks like tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Does that work with your schedule?

Customer: Tomorrow? But I have this meeting today. There's no way to get someone out today?

Agent: I understand this is frustrating. Let me see if there's any availability... (pause, typing sounds) ...unfortunately, our technicians are fully booked for today. But tomorrow morning might be an option if we can fit you in. Let me see... I could put you down for first thing in the morning tomorrow, like a 9 AM slot, would that help?

Customer: I mean, it's not ideal, but... what else can I do? Yeah, okay. Can I at least use my phone's hotspot or something for my meeting today?

Agent: Absolutely. That's actually a good workaround for today. You can tether your work device to your phone's mobile connection. It might not be as fast as your fiber, but it should be stable enough for video calls or browsing.

Customer: Yeah, okay, I'll do that. So just to confirm, someone's coming out tomorrow morning at 9?

Agent: Yes, we'll have a technician there between 9 and 10 AM tomorrow. I'm going to send a confirmation email and text to your account right now. You should see those come through. And the technician will bring a replacement modem just in case, so we should be able to get you up and running pretty quickly once they arrive.

Customer: Alright. That's... I mean, it's not great, but thanks for trying to troubleshoot it. I appreciate that.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it fixed over the phone today, Robert. I know that's frustrating. But we'll definitely have someone take a look tomorrow and get to the root of the problem. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. And thanks for being a Frontier customer. We'll see you tomorrow morning. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
