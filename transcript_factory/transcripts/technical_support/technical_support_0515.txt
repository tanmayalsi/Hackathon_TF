# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. Can I get your name and account number, please?

Customer: Yeah, hi. My name is David Chen. Um, my account number is... (pause) ...hold on, let me find that. It's 4-7-9-2-1-5-8-3.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, David. I've got your account pulled up here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. What brings you in today?

Customer: Yeah, so my internet just went down completely. I've got nothing. And I work from home, so this is... this is kind of a problem right now.

Agent: I totally understand. That's frustrating, especially when you need it for work. Let me help you get this sorted out. First, can you tell me—have you noticed any issues before this, or did it just suddenly stop working?

Customer: No, it was totally fine this morning. I was on a Zoom call until like twenty minutes ago, and then I just lost connection. Everything just went black.

Agent: Okay, so it was working fine and then suddenly dropped. Got it. Let me run a quick diagnostic on our end. (pause, typing sounds) Alright, I'm not seeing any outages in your area, which is good news. That usually means it's something we can troubleshoot. Can you tell me—do you have a router, or are you using our Frontier-provided modem and router combo?

Customer: I've got the Frontier equipment. It's all the original stuff you guys installed.

Agent: Perfect. So what I'd like you to do first is take a look at the device. Can you see if the lights are on? What color are they?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. So... the power light is on, it's green. But nothing else is lit up. The internet light is dark.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on but no internet indicator. That tells me something. Let's try the basics first. Can you unplug the power cable from the modem for me? Just pull it out of the back.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, done.

Agent: Good. Now leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds. I know it sounds simple, but this actually resets the device and clears out any errors. Just... just give it a moment.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been like thirty seconds. Now what?

Agent: Now plug it back in and we'll wait for it to fully boot up. It should take about two to three minutes. While that's happening, can you tell me—when you lost connection, did you hear or see anything unusual? Any clicking sounds from the modem, anything like that?

Customer: No, it was just... nothing. One second it was working, the next it wasn't. (pause) Okay, so the power light came back on.

Agent: Great. Give it another minute or so. You should start seeing some lights come back. While we wait, I'm just going to ask—have there been any storms in your area recently? Any wind or weather that might have affected the lines?

Customer: No, actually it's been pretty nice out. No storms or anything like that.

Agent: Okay, good. That rules that out. (pause) Are you seeing any additional lights now?

Customer: (pause) Uh... no. Just the green power light. The internet light is still dark.

Agent: Alright, let me try something else. I'm going to restart the modem from our end. Give me just one moment. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I've initiated that restart. You should see everything power down for a few seconds and then power back up. Go ahead and tell me when that happens.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. Everything went dark. Now it's... it's powering back up. Power light's green again. And... still nothing else.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay. Let me ask you this—can you check the back of the modem? Is there a coaxial cable connected? That's the thick cable that screws into the back.

Customer: Yeah, yeah, it's connected. It looks fine. It's pretty secure.

Agent: Good. And just to confirm, you have that running from the wall outlet to the modem, correct?

Customer: Yeah, from the wall socket to the modem. It all looks normal to me.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay. I'm pulling up the line diagnostics and I'm actually seeing... hmm. It looks like there might be a signal issue on our side. The line's showing as active, but the signal strength is very low. That's unusual. When was the last time you had any work done at your address?

Customer: I mean, nothing recently. You guys installed it about two years ago and it's been working great ever since.

Agent: Okay. And you haven't had any other technicians out recently? Any construction or digging happening nearby?

Customer: No, nothing like that.

Agent: (pause) David, I want to be honest with you here. What I'm seeing on the backend suggests there might be a physical issue with either the line coming into your house or potentially with the modem itself. The signal is too degraded for me to get a solid connection. 

Customer: What does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: It could be, or it could be an issue with the line. Without physically checking it, I can't say for certain. (pause) I wish I could do more over the phone, but this is beyond what I can diagnose remotely. I think we need to get a technician out to your place to check it out in person.

Customer: Really? How long would that take? Like I said, I need this for work.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) So unfortunately, our next available appointment is... tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 6 PM. I know that's not ideal, but that's what I'm seeing.

Customer: Tomorrow? That's almost a full day without internet. Is there anything else we can try?

Agent: (pause) Let me... let me try one more thing with you. Can you check if there's a reset button on the modem? It's usually a small button on the back that you have to hold down.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's a little recessed button.

Agent: Perfect. What I want you to do is use something like a paperclip or a pen to press and hold that button for about ten seconds. This will do a full factory reset of the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm holding it down. It's been about ten seconds... the lights are going crazy now, everything's flashing.

Agent: That's normal. That's the reset happening. Give it a minute or two to fully cycle through.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, it's... it's settling down now. Power light's back to green and... no, still nothing. No internet light.

Agent: (pause, sighs) Yeah, I'm afraid that didn't do it. What we're seeing is consistent with a hardware failure or a line issue. I really do think we need to get someone out there.

Customer: Alright, fine. So tomorrow between 2 and 6 PM?

Agent: Yes, that's the soonest I can get you. I'm going to schedule that appointment for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so you're all set for tomorrow, Saturday, between 2 and 6 PM. A technician will come out and investigate the issue. They'll be able to check the line, test the modem, and get everything working again.

Customer: And there's no charge for this, right? Since it's not on my end?

Agent: If it's a service line issue on our end, there would be no charge. If it happens to be the modem, there might be a small service charge, but the technician will let you know once they assess the situation.

Customer: Okay. I guess that'll have to do. Is there anything I should do in the meantime?

Agent: Just leave everything as it is. Don't worry about it. And make sure someone's home tomorrow afternoon during that window so they can get access to check the line. You should also receive a text and email confirmation of the appointment shortly.

Customer: Alright, I will. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: I really am sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone, David. But we'll get you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good rest of your day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
