Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just completely stopped working about an hour ago. I've got no connection at all.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that! I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one second here... Got it. I'm looking at your account for... Michael Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. So you're experiencing a complete loss of internet service as of about an hour ago. Before we dive into troubleshooting, have there been any recent storms in your area, or did anything else happen before the internet went down?

Customer: No, no storms or anything. It was just... working fine, and then I went to check my email and the WiFi symbol just disappeared. No internet on any of my devices.

Agent: Understood. Okay, so first thing I'd like you to do is check your modem and router for me. Can you tell me what lights are showing on your equipment right now?

Customer: (pause) Uh, yeah, let me look... So the power light is on, it's solid green. But the internet light... it's red. Is that bad?

Agent: The red light on the internet port typically means there's no connection coming into the modem from our network. That's what we're looking for, actually. Now, I'd like you to do a quick restart. Can you unplug the power cable from the back of your modem?

Customer: Okay, unplugging now... (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. Let's wait about thirty seconds for it to fully power down.

Customer: (pause) Thirty seconds, got it. Done.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in and we'll give it about two minutes to boot back up. While that's happening, let me ask you—have you had any issues with your service recently? Any outages or slowness?

Customer: No, nothing. It's been working great actually. This is the first real problem I've had since I switched over from my old provider.

Agent: That's good to hear. (typing sounds) Okay, and it's been about two minutes. Are you seeing any changes in the lights on your modem?

Customer: (pause) Let me check... The power light is still green, but now the internet light is... it's still red. It's not changing.

Agent: Okay, still showing red. Let me try a different approach. Can you tell me what model modem you have? It should be labeled on the front or back of the device.

Customer: Um, let me see... It says "Frontier" on it... and then... FGW-N3000. Is that it?

Agent: Perfect, that's helpful. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm looking at the specs for that unit. Let me have you try a factory reset. This will clear any configuration issues. There should be a small reset button on the back—you might need a paperclip or something thin to press it.

Customer: A reset button? (pause) Oh yeah, I see it. It's really tiny back here.

Agent: Right. Go ahead and hold that down for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... Should I hear anything? It's... nothing's happening that I can see.

Agent: You might see the lights flicker or go dark for a moment. Just keep holding it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, the lights just went out completely. Now they're coming back on. Is that normal?

Agent: Yes, that's exactly what should happen. Now we need to give it about three to four minutes to fully reconfigure itself. This is a full reset, so it's going to take a little longer than a regular restart.

Customer: (pause) Alright, waiting... So if this doesn't work, what does that mean? Is it my equipment?

Agent: It could be a few things. It might be an issue with the modem itself, or there could be a problem on our network side. Let's see how this reset goes first, and then we'll troubleshoot from there if needed.

Customer: Okay, yeah. (pause) Uh, how much longer? It's been a few minutes.

Agent: Let's give it another thirty seconds or so. The lights should stabilize when it's ready. What are you seeing now?

Customer: Okay, so the power light is green again, and the WiFi light is blinking now, which is different. But the internet light... (pause) ...still red.

Agent: (pause) Alright, the WiFi light blinking is actually a good sign. That means the WiFi portion is working, but we're still not getting an internet connection from the line. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) Can you give me one second?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (pause) Michael, I'm pulling up our network diagnostics for your address. I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, and your line is provisioned correctly on our end. The issue seems to be something between our network connection and your modem.

Customer: So what does that mean? Do I have a bad modem?

Agent: It could be, or there might be a line issue. Let me try one more thing before we go down that road. Can you check the cable connections coming into your modem? There should be a coaxial cable—it's the thick cable with the threaded connection.

Customer: Oh yeah, I see it. It's plugged in pretty tight.

Agent: Okay, can you try unplugging that cable and plugging it back in? Sometimes they can become slightly loose.

Customer: (pause) Unplugging... and... plugging back in. Okay, done. Should I look at the modem now?

Agent: Yes, let me know if anything changes with those lights.

Customer: (pause) Still the same. Green power, blinking WiFi, and red internet light. Nothing's changed.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Michael, I've gone through the standard troubleshooting steps, and unfortunately we're still not seeing that internet connection come through. At this point, I have a couple of options. We can schedule a technician to come out to your location and check the line from our junction point to your home, which might take three to five business days. Or, we could potentially send you a replacement modem to rule that out.

Customer: How long would the replacement take?

Agent: The replacement would typically arrive within two to three business days, but that still leaves you without internet in the meantime. The technician visit might actually be faster if you're available soon. We might have openings tomorrow or the day after.

Customer: (pause) Tomorrow would be really helpful. Let me check my schedule... Yeah, tomorrow works for me. What time are we talking?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available... I can schedule you for a window between 8 AM and 12 PM tomorrow. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, you're all set for tomorrow, December 14th, between 8 and noon. A technician will come out and check your line and your equipment. They'll have all the tools they need. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay, great. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope it gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I'm sure our technician will get you back online as quickly as possible. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Have a great day!
