# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So, um, my internet just went out completely. Like, it was working fine this morning, and now I can't get online at all.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... hold on. (pause) It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And your name?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Great, James. And just to confirm, you're completely unable to connect to the internet right now? Like, you're not getting any connection at all?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. I've got a laptop and my phone, and neither one will connect. And I tried unplugging the modem and router like... you know, the basic stuff.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on that. Sometimes that does the trick. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on your modem right now? Is it powered on?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's powered on. There's a light at the top that's... it's like a solid green light. But the internet light, I think, is amber or orange? It's definitely not green.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on, but the internet indicator is orange. That typically means we're not getting a signal to your modem. Let me just pull up your account here real quick. (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm showing that your service is active. Can you check your modem and make sure all the cables are plugged in securely? There should be a cable coming in from outside—it's usually a coax cable.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Yeah, okay, I'm looking at it now. Um, let me just... yeah, the cable looks pretty tight. It's definitely plugged in.

Agent: Alright. And do you see any damage on the cable itself? Like any pinches or anything?

Customer: No, looks okay to me.

Agent: Got it. Alright, let's try a reboot of the modem. Can you unplug it from the power for about 30 seconds and then plug it back in?

Customer: Sure, yeah. (pause) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) I'll wait... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in.

Agent: Great. Give it about a minute to boot back up. While we're waiting, is this the first time this has happened, or have you had connectivity issues before?

Customer: First time, actually. We've had the service for like... three years now? And it's usually pretty solid.

Agent: That's good to know. Okay, so are you seeing any changes in the lights yet?

Customer: (pause) Um... no, it's still the same. Still orange.

Agent: Hmm, alright. That's unusual. Let me check a couple other things. Have you experienced any weather recently? Like storms or anything that might have affected your line?

Customer: Oh, actually, yeah. There was some pretty heavy rain last night. Could that have something to do with it?

Agent: It's possible. Weather can definitely affect the signal coming to your home. Let me see if we're showing any outages in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any widespread outages, but that doesn't rule out damage to your specific line. Let me check something else here... (pause) Okay, so from our end, I'm not seeing a connection from your modem to our network. It's like we're not even picking up that your modem is trying to communicate.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is there something wrong with my modem?

Agent: It could be the modem, or it could be a line issue outside. Let me have you try a couple more things. First, can you check the coax cable on the modem itself and make sure it's hand-tight?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm checking it now. It seems tight to me.

Agent: Okay. And when you plug in your phone's charger, does that outlet work fine?

Customer: Yeah, why? The modem is plugged in fine, though.

Agent: Right, I know. I'm just ruling things out. Let me have you try a factory reset on the modem. There should be a small reset button. Do you see it?

Customer: Um... (pause) I see a button here that says "Reset." Is that it?

Agent: Yes, that's the one. You'll need something small like a paperclip to press it. Hold it down for about ten seconds while the modem is powered on.

Customer: Okay, hold on. (pause) Got a paperclip. (pause) Alright, I'm pressing it. (pause) How long did you say?

Agent: About ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, let go. Now what?

Agent: Now we'll let it reboot again. This might take a couple of minutes.

Customer: (pause) Alright. So while we're waiting... do you think it's the modem then?

Agent: It could be, but honestly, based on what we're seeing, it's more likely an issue with your external line or the connection point from our network to your house. But let's see what happens after this reset.

Customer: (pause) Nothing yet. The lights are... still the same. Orange.

Agent: (pause) Alright, James. I'm going to be honest with you—we've gone through the standard troubleshooting steps, and I'm not picking up any connection from your modem on our end. At this point, I think we need to get a technician out to your location to check your external line and the connection point.

Customer: Oh man, really? How long does that usually take?

Agent: Well, I can schedule one for you. We typically have availability within 24 to 48 hours, depending on your area. Would you prefer a morning or afternoon appointment?

Customer: Um, I mean... is there anything else we can try right now?

Agent: (pause) We could try one more thing. Let me see if we can remotely reset your connection from our end. Give me just one moment. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I've sent a reset command. Can you watch your modem lights and tell me if anything changes?

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) ...nothing. Same thing.

Agent: Yeah, that's what I thought. Unfortunately, I'm not able to reinitialize your connection on my end, which indicates it's likely a hardware issue or an external line problem. I really think we need a technician to come take a look.

Customer: Alright, alright. Yeah, go ahead and schedule that then. Can you do morning? Mornings are better for me.

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) I'm showing availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works. I'll be home.

Agent: Perfect. You should receive a confirmation email shortly, and we'll also send you a text message with the technician's information. Is the phone number on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Alright, James. I really do apologize for the trouble. Hopefully, our technician will have you back up and running tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too.
