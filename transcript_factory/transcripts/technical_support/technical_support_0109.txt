# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I'm supposed to be working from home today and I can't do anything without it.

Agent: I understand how frustrating that must be. I'm sorry you're experiencing service issues. I'd be happy to help you get back online. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... uh... (pause) 555-0847. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And what's your name?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Thank you. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Alright, I've got you here. So your service went down this morning—do you remember approximately what time that happened?

Customer: I'd say around... maybe 8 o'clock? I went to check my email and nothing was loading. Just kept timing out.

Agent: Okay. And just to confirm, you're not getting any internet at all right now, correct?

Customer: No, nothing. I've got the modem and router in my office and all the lights are... well, they're kind of blinking weird. Normally they're solid green, but now they're like, red and orange or something.

Agent: Alright, that's actually really helpful information. The lights usually indicate what's going on with the connection. So let me walk you through a few troubleshooting steps, okay? First thing—can you locate your modem? It's usually a box about this big, maybe six inches wide?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I see it. It's right here next to my router.

Agent: Perfect. I want you to unplug the power cable from the back of the modem. Just pull it out for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, done. Should I wait?

Agent: Yes, let's wait about 30 seconds. This'll give it a chance to fully power down. While we're waiting, have you noticed any outages in your area? Any storms or anything like that recently?

Customer: Not that I know of. I mean, it was a little cloudy this morning, but nothing major. No storms or anything.

Agent: Okay, good to know. (pause) Alright, 30 seconds should be up. Go ahead and plug that power cable back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in now. (pause) Um, it's starting up. I see some lights coming on.

Agent: Great. While that's booting back up, can you look at your router as well? Is it still powered on?

Customer: Oh, wait—you know what, I think I might've unplugged the router too by accident when I was fidgeting with the cables.

Agent: (chuckles) That happens more often than you'd think. Go ahead and make sure that's plugged in too.

Customer: Okay, it's plugged in. Both lights are on now... but I'm still not seeing internet. The modem lights are... (pause) okay, they're amber now, not red. Is that better?

Agent: Amber is actually a step in the right direction. It means the modem is trying to connect. Let's give it another minute or so to fully boot up and sync with our network. While we're waiting, can you tell me—did anything change with your equipment recently? Any power outages, any storms?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was just working fine yesterday. Everything was normal.

Agent: Okay. And you haven't called in for any service appointments or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Okay, so we've waited a minute now. Are you seeing any changes in those lights?

Customer: Um... (pause) They're still amber. Just the modem and router lights. Should I try restarting them again?

Agent: Let's try a different approach. Before we do that, can you check something for me? Look at your modem and tell me if there's a cable going into the wall—like a coax cable?

Customer: A coax? Um... (pause) Yeah, there's like a thick cable that screws into the back of the modem.

Agent: Perfect, that's what I'm looking for. Can you check if that cable is tight? Just try twisting it clockwise—don't force it, just see if it's loose.

Customer: (pause) Oh! Huh. Yeah, it actually—it was a little loose. I don't know how that happened. Let me tighten it up. (pause) Okay, it's tighter now.

Agent: Great catch! That could definitely be causing issues. Go ahead and let's wait another 30 seconds and see if those lights change.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Um, they're still amber. Not changing much.

Agent: Alright, still amber. Let me try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem again, but this time also unplug the router. We'll do a complete reset of both devices—what we call a cold reboot.

Customer: Sure. (pause) Both unplugged now.

Agent: Okay, let's wait about 60 seconds this time. I'm going to check on something in our system while we do that. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area, which is good news. It does look like there might be some network activity flagged on your line, though. We might need to investigate that further. (pause) Alright, 60 seconds should be up. Go ahead and plug the modem back in first.

Customer: Okay, it's plugging in. (pause) Lights are coming on again.

Agent: Now plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) Done. (pause) Still the same thing... amber lights, no internet.

Agent: (pause) Okay. David, I'm going to be honest with you—we've tried the standard troubleshooting steps and we're not seeing the modem fully sync to our network, which is unusual. At this point, I think we might be dealing with either a modem hardware issue or possibly a network-side problem that I can't see from my end.

Customer: So... what does that mean? How long is this going to take to fix?

Agent: Well, we have a couple of options. One is I can schedule a technician to come out to your home and do some diagnostics on-site. They can check the modem, the outside line, and everything to see where the issue is. Or, if you'd like, I can send a replacement modem out to you first and see if that resolves it.

Customer: How long would a technician take? Because like I said, I really need my internet back today if possible.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) It looks like we can get a technician out to you today, but the earliest available appointment would be between 2 and 6 PM. Would that work for your schedule?

Customer: Ugh... yeah, I guess that'll have to work. But I really can't be without internet much longer than that.

Agent: I hear you. We'll get someone out to you as quickly as we can. Let me get that scheduled for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, I have you down for a technician visit today between 2 and 6 PM. Your confirmation number is 847623. We'll send you a text message with a more specific time window closer to the appointment.

Customer: Okay. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure you're home and that you have access to the modem and router. The technician will likely need to check connections and possibly replace the modem, so just have that area accessible for them.

Customer: Alright. Well... I guess that's all I can do then.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get it resolved over the phone today, David. But our technician should be able to figure out exactly what's going on and get you back online. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Hopefully I'll be up and running later today.

Agent: I hope so too. And hey, if for some reason the technician can't make it or there's an issue, don't hesitate to call us back. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, David. Have a good day, and we'll see you later this afternoon.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
