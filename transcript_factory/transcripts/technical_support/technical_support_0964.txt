Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging everything and plugging it back in, but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm looking at your account now. So you're in Scottsdale, Arizona, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And you mentioned you've already tried the basic restart—unplugging the modem and router?

Customer: Yeah, I did that. I waited like thirty seconds and plugged everything back in, and the modem still won't light up at all. That's the problem. There's no lights on it.

Agent: Okay, so the modem has no lights at all. That could be a power issue. Let me ask you—can you see if the power cable is securely connected to the back of the modem? Sometimes it can get loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. It seems pretty tight, but let me... (sounds of movement) ...let me try wiggling it a little bit.

Agent: Sure, give that a try.

Customer: Okay, um... (pause) ...nope, still nothing. No lights.

Agent: Alright. And the power outlet itself—is it working? Do you have anything else plugged into that outlet that you know is working?

Customer: Oh, that's a good point. Let me try plugging my lamp in there. (pause) Yeah, the lamp turns on, so the outlet's fine.

Agent: Good, so we know it's not the outlet. Let me try a different power cable if you have one available. Do you have another power cord around the house that might fit?

Customer: Hmm... I mean, maybe? I'm not really sure what would fit. Isn't there something else we can try first?

Agent: That's fair. Let me... (typing sounds) ...let me check if there are any outages in your area that might be affecting your service.

Customer: Oh, is that a thing?

Agent: It can be, yeah. Sometimes we have maintenance or equipment issues on our end. (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any reported outages in your zip code at the moment. That's good news and bad news, I guess. It means the problem is likely with your equipment.

Customer: Great. (sighs) So what do we do?

Agent: Well, the modem not powering on at all is pretty unusual. Usually there's something drawing power. Um... (pause) ...do you happen to have a different power adapter that might work? Sometimes they're not proprietary. If you have another adapter from, like, an old router or modem lying around, you could try that.

Customer: I don't think so. I mean, I could look around, but... I don't know. Can't you guys just send me a new modem?

Agent: We can definitely do that, but I want to exhaust our troubleshooting options first, just to make sure. Um, let me ask you this—when did this happen? Did the modem just suddenly stop working, or did you notice anything leading up to it?

Customer: No, it just... I was working this morning, everything was fine, and then around noon I noticed the internet was down. I came over to check the equipment and the modem was just dark. No lights, no nothing.

Agent: Okay. And there wasn't a power outage or anything like that?

Customer: No, the power's been on the whole time. I mean, my TV is on, my computer's running on battery, everything else is fine.

Agent: Right, right. (pause) Okay, here's what I want to try. Can you unplug the modem one more time and just hold it unplugged for about two minutes? Sometimes that can reset the power supply.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, yeah, I can try that. (pause) Two minutes, right?

Agent: Yep, two minutes. I'll wait on the line with you.

Customer: Alright. (pause, then background noise of unplugging sounds) ...Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just, uh, just let me know when two minutes are up. (long pause, awkward silence) So, how long have you been a Frontier customer?

Customer: Oh, uh... (pause) ...I'd say about three years now?

Agent: Nice. And have you had any issues with your service before this?

Customer: No, actually, you've been pretty solid. This is the first real problem I've had.

Agent: That's good to hear. Okay, I think that should be about two minutes now. Go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Okay, it's plugged in. (pause, waiting) Still nothing. No lights.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay. That's... that's not ideal. Um, let me think about what else we can try here. (typing sounds) Have you checked to see if there's a power button on the modem that might be off?

Customer: A power button? (pause) Let me look at the back... No, I don't see anything like that.

Agent: What model modem do you have? It should say on the front or back.

Customer: (pause) It says... Frontier... FX-5000 or something like that. I'm not great with this stuff.

Agent: Okay, FX-5000. (typing sounds) Let me pull up the specs on that. (pause) Yeah, so that model should power on automatically when it's plugged in. There's no manual power button.

Customer: So it should just turn on?

Agent: Right, it should just turn on when there's power supplied to it.

Customer: (pause) Well, it's not doing that.

Agent: Yeah, I'm gathering that. (pause) I think at this point we might be looking at a hardware failure. The modem might have just... failed.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It means the modem itself is likely defective. We can definitely send you a replacement. It should arrive in about three to five business days with standard shipping.

Customer: Three to five days? (pause) Is there any faster option?

Agent: There is express shipping, but that does have an additional charge. It would be around $25 extra, and it would get to you in one to two business days.

Customer: (pause) Can't you guys come out and check it or something?

Agent: We could schedule a technician visit, but given that we've ruled out most of the troubleshooting steps, I'm pretty confident it's the modem itself. And a technician visit would likely have a service fee associated with it anyway.

Customer: [inaudible] ...this is frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand. I know this is a hassle. Tell you what, let me make a note on your account. When the replacement modem arrives, setup is really straightforward. And I'll send you an email with step-by-step instructions.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Can I just... can we try one more thing? Is there any chance it's something else? Like the ONT or whatever?

Agent: The ONT—that's the optical network terminal. That's actually a good thought. Those are usually mounted outside. Did you notice any lights on that?

Customer: Oh. I didn't even think to check. Let me go look. (pause, sounds of moving) Um, I'm outside now. There's a gray box on the side of my house. There are lights on it—I see like a red light and a green light.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing lights on the ONT. What color are they specifically?

Customer: Red and green. The red one's blinking.

Agent: Red and blinking, okay. That actually might indicate an issue on the line. Um, let me check our system here to see if there's anything showing on our end. (pause, typing sounds) (pause) Hmm, I'm not seeing any issues with the line from our side. The red blinking light usually means either a power issue or a connection issue with the modem.

Customer: But the modem has no power, so...

Agent: Right, so that's probably what's causing it. Because the ONT is trying to communicate with the modem and can't, so it's showing that error.

Customer: So it is just the modem then.

Agent: Yeah, I think so. It does appear to be the modem.

Customer: (pause) Alright. Can you just order the replacement? And, um, the express shipping is fine.

Agent: Absolutely. I can get that set up for you right now. The modem will be $0—it's covered under your service agreement—and it'll be $25 for the expedited shipping. So your total out of pocket is $25. Is that okay?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. (typing sounds) Okay, and I'm sending that replacement modem to your address on file at 2847 Palomino Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. You should receive it by... (pause) ...Wednesday or Thursday at the latest. And again, I'll send you instructions on how to set it up. It's really simple—just plug it in and it should connect to our network automatically. 

Customer: Okay. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: No, that should be it. Just keep an eye out for the package. If you don't receive it by Friday, give us a call back and we can track it down for you.

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Of course! I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online today, but we'll have you up and running very soon. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, perfect. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
