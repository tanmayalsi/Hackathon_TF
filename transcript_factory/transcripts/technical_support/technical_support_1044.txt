Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I can't figure out what's going on. I've got work calls coming up and I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you get back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Uh, yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm pulling that up now. And your name is...?

Customer: It's James. James Patterson.

Agent: Great, James. I've got you here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Yeah, it was around 7 AM. I woke up, tried to check my email, and nothing. The router's just... I don't know, it's not doing anything.

Agent: Okay, and just to confirm—do you have our Frontier router, or are you using your own?

Customer: It's yours. The white box thing.

Agent: Perfect. So here's what I'm gonna do. Let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what lights are showing on your router right now?

Customer: (pause) Um, okay, so there's... there's a light on top that's blinking red. And then there's another one that looks like it's not on at all.

Agent: Alright, so the red blinking light—that typically indicates there's a connection issue. Let's try a power cycle. Can you unplug the router for me? Just pull the power cable out completely.

Customer: Yeah, sure. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Just leave it unplugged for about thirty seconds while we wait.

Customer: (pause) Okay, thirty seconds... done. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yeah, go ahead and plug it back in now, and then let's give it a minute or two to fully boot up.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's plugging back in. I can see the lights are starting to... there's some activity.

Agent: Great. While that's booting up, let me ask you a couple of questions. Have you made any changes to your setup recently? New router placement, any work done on your house, anything like that?

Customer: No, no, nothing like that. It was working fine yesterday and just... stopped. This is really frustrating.

Agent: I totally understand. Okay, so those lights should be settling down now. What are you seeing?

Customer: (pause) Um, okay, so now I've got the red one still blinking, but maybe a little slower? And there's a green one that came on.

Agent: The red blinking is still a concern. Let me check your service status here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any outages in your area, so that's good news. But let me pull up your modem status. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing that we're not getting a connection from your modem on our end.

Customer: What does that mean? Is it broken?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. Let me have you check your cables. Can you see where the cable line comes into your modem?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it now. There's a cable that goes from the wall to the back of the router thing.

Agent: Perfect. Can you check that cable? See if it's plugged in all the way? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, it looks pretty tight to me. But let me try... (sound of movement) ...okay, I'm... I'm pushing it in a little more to make sure it's snug.

Agent: Good, good. Now let's wait just a minute and see if we get a change in those lights.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) No, it's still the same. Red blinking, green light.

Agent: Alright. Let me try something else. I'm going to do a factory reset on your modem from our side. This might take a couple minutes. You'll probably see the lights flash and change around a bit, so don't panic.

Customer: Okay, uh... alright.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm initiating that now. Should start in just a moment.

Customer: (pause) Oh, okay, yeah, I see... the lights are flashing now. Multiple lights. That's different.

Agent: That's good—that's what we want to see. Let's give this about two minutes to complete.

Customer: (pause) This better work. I'm supposed to be on a conference call at eleven and it's already quarter to.

Agent: I hear you. We'll get you sorted out. (pause) Okay, how are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) They're still... kind of doing the same thing. Still that red blinking.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay, James, I'm not seeing the modem re-establishing a connection on our end either. Let me ask you this—are you in a multi-unit building, or is this a house?

Customer: It's a house. Single family.

Agent: Okay. And you're positive the cable from the wall outlet is the Frontier cable and not like... a cable TV line or something?

Customer: Well... I mean, I think so? I just assumed it was connected right. [inaudible] ...isn't it?

Agent: It should be, but sometimes we do see them mixed up. Just to be sure, is there any other cable outlet near that one? Maybe for cable TV or anything?

Customer: Oh, actually, yeah, there is. There's one right next to it. You don't think—

Agent: Why don't you try swapping it? Pull the cable from the outlet next to it and plug that into your modem instead.

Customer: (pause) Okay, just to be clear, I'm unplugging this one—(sound of unplugging)—and plugging this other one in. (sound of plugging in)

Agent: Yep, that's it. And let's see what happens.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... (pause) The lights... they're, uh... (pause) ...no, it's still the same thing. Still red.

Agent: (pause) Okay. That's not it then. Let me check something in your account here. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm. James, when was the last time you paid your bill?

Customer: I mean, I paid it on time last month. It should be fine. Everything's current.

Agent: Okay, okay, everything's showing as current here, so that's not the issue. Let me try one more thing. I'm gonna check if there's a line issue from our side. (pause) Can you hold for just a moment while I see if I can get some information?

Customer: Yeah, sure. (hold music plays)

Customer: (hold music continues for about 30 seconds)

Agent: Okay, James, thanks for holding. So I spoke with our technical team, and they're actually showing some concern about your line. It's possible that your external connection might be damaged or compromised. Do you have any construction or digging happening in your neighborhood?

Customer: (pause) Now that you mention it, there was a contractor doing some work on the street yesterday. Gas line or something. Could that have...?

Agent: That's very possible, actually. They could've potentially damaged the line going to your house, or there could be a break somewhere between the street and your property. Unfortunately, that's something we'd need to send a technician out to check and repair.

Customer: Are you kidding me? How long is that gonna take?

Agent: Well, let me see what our availability is. (typing sounds) (pause) So our next available appointment would be... it looks like tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? I mean... I guess it has to, but I really need internet today. Is there any way—

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry. If there is a physical line issue, we do need to get a technician out there to diagnose and fix it. And unfortunately, that's really the only way forward if that's what's happening.

Customer: (pause) Alright. Yeah, okay. Can you just... can you make sure they call me before they come out or something?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm putting a note on your account right now, and they'll definitely contact you. Just to confirm, what's the best number to reach you at?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as before.

Agent: Perfect. And I'm gonna also put a note that this is related to possible infrastructure damage from contractor work in the area, so the tech knows to check that first thing.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I appreciate it. This is just... frustrating timing.

Agent: I completely get it, James. I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved today over the phone. But our technician should be able to get you back up and running tomorrow. We really do appreciate your patience.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, you should receive a confirmation call tomorrow morning. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, James.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: Have a good one.
