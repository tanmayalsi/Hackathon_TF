Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet has been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I work from home, so this is kind of a big deal.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment... and can I get the last name on the account?

Customer: It's Morrison. M-O-R-R-I-S-O-N.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Okay, I've got you here. So your internet went down this morning, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around 8 AM. I was trying to log into a meeting and just... nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: Alright. And just to clarify, are you experiencing a complete outage? Like, is your modem powered on and showing any lights?

Customer: Yeah, actually, that's a good question. Let me look at it. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at it now. The power light is on, it's green. But, um, the internet light—I think it's supposed to be green too, right?—that one is red.

Agent: Okay, good. That's helpful information. So the red light on the internet port typically means there's no connection coming from the line. Let's try a few things. First, can you go ahead and unplug the modem for me? Just pull the power cable out.

Customer: Unplug it? Like completely?

Agent: Yes, completely. Just pull the power cord out of the back.

Customer: (pause) Okay, done. Now what?

Agent: Now I want you to wait about thirty seconds. Just give it a little time.

Customer: (pause) Alright, still waiting...

Agent: Thanks for your patience. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Got it. Plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, it's back on.

Agent: Great. Now we're gonna give it about a minute or two to fully boot back up. While that's happening, let me just ask you a few quick questions. Are you directly connected to the modem with an ethernet cable, or are you using WiFi?

Customer: I'm using WiFi. Does that matter?

Agent: It can sometimes, but not in this case. Okay, so let's see... (pause) How's that modem looking now? Are you seeing any changes in those lights?

Customer: (pause) Um... no, still the same. Power is green, but the internet light is still red.

Agent: Alright, let me try something else. On your modem, there should be a small reset button, usually recessed. Do you see that?

Customer: A reset button? Where would that be?

Agent: It's usually on the back of the modem, and it might be in a little hole that you'd need to use a paperclip or something to press.

Customer: (pause) Oh, I think I see it. Yeah, there's a little hole here on the back.

Agent: Okay, so I'm going to be honest with you—resetting the modem will erase your WiFi settings, so you'll have to set that back up. But it might help. Do you want to go ahead?

Customer: Yeah, sure. Let's try it. What do I do?

Agent: Just take a paperclip or something similar and press and hold that button for about ten seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that now... (pause) ...and let go. Now what?

Agent: Now the modem's gonna restart. It might take a couple of minutes to fully come back online. Go ahead and give it a couple minutes and then check those lights again.

Customer: (pause, background noise of waiting) Okay, I'm gonna give it a minute... (pause) Alright, checking it now...

Agent: What are you seeing?

Customer: The power light is green still, but that internet light is... still red. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand. Let me check our system here on my end to see if there are any service issues in your area or anything like that. (typing sounds, pause) When was the last time you had your service working properly?

Customer: Everything was fine last night. I shut everything down around 6 PM, and then when I turned it on this morning around 8, nothing.

Agent: Okay. Let me just check... (pause) I'm not seeing any outages in your area or any issues on our end with your account. But I am noticing that your modem isn't registering a downstream signal. That's why you're getting that red light.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be an issue with the line coming into your house, or it could be that the modem itself has an issue. Let me have you try one more thing. Can you check the cable that's running from the wall to your modem? Just make sure it's securely connected on both ends?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let me see... (pause) Okay, I'm checking the connection at the modem and... it looks pretty tight. Let me check the other end at the wall. (pause) Yeah, that looks secure too.

Agent: Alright. And you're not seeing any visible damage to the cable itself? Like, is it bent or anything?

Customer: No, it looks fine.

Agent: Okay. (pause) I'm thinking at this point we might need to get a technician out to your location. It sounds like it could be something with the line itself or possibly the modem hardware. Do you have a pen handy? I'm going to get you scheduled.

Customer: Wait, how long would that take? I really need my internet working. I have back-to-back calls all day.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (typing sounds, pause) What does your schedule look like for tomorrow? Can you do an appointment between 9 and 5?

Customer: Um, tomorrow is tight with work, but I guess I could... do you have any evening slots?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) I'm seeing we have availability tomorrow evening between 5 and 7 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, I guess that's better than nothing. Let me do that.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, there will be a service call fee of $99 if there's no issue found with our infrastructure. But if it's on our end, there's no charge.

Customer: Okay, got it. So... is there anything else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: (pause) Honestly, I think we've gone through the main troubleshooting steps. Since the modem isn't registering any downstream signal, it's likely something that'll need hands-on diagnosis. Is there anywhere else you could work from today? A coffee shop or library, maybe?

Customer: Yeah, I could probably go to my local library or something, but... I mean, this is my home office. It's inconvenient.

Agent: I totally get that, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me make sure I have all your information correct for the appointment. You're at 555-0147, Morrison, and that's M-O-R-R-I-S-O-N, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: And your appointment is scheduled for tomorrow, [inaudible], between 5 and 7 PM. A technician will be out to assess the issue. You should receive a confirmation call about an hour before they arrive. Do you have any other questions for me?

Customer: No, I think... I mean, I'm not thrilled about the wait, but I guess it is what it is. Thanks for trying.

Agent: I really appreciate your patience today, and I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. Our technician should be able to get you back up and running tomorrow evening. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow evening. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
