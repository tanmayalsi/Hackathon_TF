# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I work from home and I've got meetings coming up.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... uh, 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get your name please?

Customer: It's David. David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. So your internet's completely down—you're not getting any signal at all?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. The modem's lit up but I'm not getting internet on any of my devices. I tried my laptop, my phone... nothing's connecting.

Agent: Alright, let's troubleshoot this together. First thing I want you to do is take a look at your modem—that's the Frontier equipment usually in a box. Can you tell me what lights you're seeing on it?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... I'm looking at it now. There's a power light that's green. Um, there's a blue light that's on. And then there's like... a red light that's blinking.

Agent: Okay, okay. So that red light blinking—that's actually what we want to look at. That typically means there's a connection issue. Have you noticed any outages in your area? Did you check your email for any notifications from us?

Customer: No, I didn't check. Let me... no, I don't see anything. Do you know if there's an outage?

Agent: Let me check that for you. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not showing any outages reported in your area code. Okay, so let's try a couple of things. First, can you unplug the modem from the power source for about thirty seconds?

Customer: Sure. (sounds of movement) Yeah, I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. So just hold it unplugged for about half a minute. This is called a hard reset and sometimes it clears things up.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's been unplugged. Should I plug it back in now?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (sounds of plugging in) Alright, it's powering back on. (pause) Um... okay, so the green light's back. And the blue light's coming back on. But... yeah, the red light's still blinking.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Still seeing that red light. Alright, let me ask you this—do you see a cable running from your modem to the wall? Like a coaxial cable?

Customer: Yeah, I see... there's like a cord thing going into the wall, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. Can you check where that connects to the modem and just make sure it's firmly plugged in? Sometimes these can come a little loose.

Customer: (sounds of movement) Oh, actually... let me... (pause) Hmm, it looks pretty tight to me.

Agent: Okay. And on the other end, where it goes into the wall, can you check that connection too?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that's... that looks secure as well.

Agent: Alright, I appreciate you checking that. Can you also tell me—when did this start? Did something happen this morning? Like a storm or power outage or anything like that?

Customer: Well, there was some weather early this morning. We had some heavy rain and wind, but the power didn't go out. The modem was working when I went to bed.

Agent: That could definitely be it. Sometimes weather-related issues can affect the connections. (pause) Okay, so we've got a couple more things we can try. Do you see a reset button on the modem? It's usually a small recessed button.

Customer: A reset button... let me look. I think there's a little button here, yeah. It looks really small.

Agent: Right, so we want to be careful with that one. Before you press it, I should mention that if we do a factory reset, it's going to clear all your Wi-Fi settings. So you'll need to set it back up.

Customer: Oh. Um, what does that mean exactly?

Agent: Well, it means your Wi-Fi network will essentially disappear and you'll have to reconnect your devices using the default network name and password. Do you have your setup information handy? It should be on a sticker on the back or bottom of the modem.

Customer: I... I'm not really sure. Do I have to do that?

Agent: Well, it's worth a try before we move to the next step. But if you'd rather not deal with that right now, we can try something else first. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) Can you tell me when you last restarted your modem before this morning?

Customer: I don't know... maybe a week ago? I don't really restart it much.

Agent: That's pretty normal. Okay, so let me explain what I'm thinking here. That red blinking light usually indicates a downstream connection issue. This could be something on our end with the line coming into your house, or it could be a problem with the modem itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it?

Agent: Well, based on what we're seeing and what we've tried, I think we might need to get a technician out to take a look at the physical line. There could be a problem with the connection from our network to your house, especially if that weather this morning affected the lines.

Customer: Oh no, really? How long would that take?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) (pause) I can get someone out to you... I'm looking at tomorrow or the day after. We have a window between 8 AM and 5 PM. Does either of those days work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow would be better. Tomorrow morning if possible.

Agent: (typing sounds) Actually, we do have a 9 AM to 11 AM slot available tomorrow. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works. But I really need internet today if possible. Is there anything else we can try?

Agent: (pause) I understand. Let me try one more thing. Can you unplug the modem again, but this time wait for a full minute?

Customer: A full minute? Okay. (pause) It's unplugged. (long pause) Okay, that should be about a minute now. Plugging it back in... (sounds of plugging in) (pause) Alright.

Agent: Alright, let's wait about thirty seconds for it to fully boot up.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Still have the green light, blue light, and... the red light's still blinking.

Agent: (pause) Okay, yeah. Unfortunately, that's still showing that same error. I wish I had better news, David. Based on this, I'm fairly confident we need to get someone out there to check the line. There could be water damage or a loose connection on the pole that's causing this.

Customer: Ugh, okay. So I'm stuck without internet until tomorrow?

Agent: I'm sorry about that. But yes, let's get you scheduled with a technician tomorrow morning. And they should be able to resolve it when they arrive. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I guess not. Just... get it working as soon as possible, please.

Agent: Absolutely. So just to confirm—I have you down for tomorrow, Tuesday, between 9 AM and 11 AM. You'll receive a confirmation email with the appointment details. The technician will be able to see the problem when they arrive. Your account number is 555-0847. Is that the best number to reach you if the technician needs to contact you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. And David, I want to apologize for the inconvenience. I know this is frustrating, especially working from home. Unfortunately, without being able to resolve this remotely, the technician visit is our best option.

Customer: Alright. Thank you, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. If you have any other questions before the appointment, feel free to give us a call back. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll get you back online tomorrow.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Have a good day, David.
