# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so my internet just went out completely. It was working fine this morning and now nothing. No connection at all.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me get some information from you so I can help troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm pulling up your account now. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, you're having no internet connection at all right now, correct?

Customer: Right, nothing. All my devices—my laptop, my phone on WiFi, nothing's working. I need this fixed today if possible. I work from home.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me help you get back online. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is your modem powered on? Do you see any lights on it?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's on. Let me look at it... (pause) Okay, so I see the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light—the one that should be blue, I think?—that one's not on. It's just dark.

Agent: Okay, that's actually really helpful information. The internet light being off could mean a few things. Let's try a quick restart of your modem. Can you unplug it for me?

Customer: Now?

Agent: Yes, please. Just unplug it from the power source and wait about 30 seconds.

Customer: (background noise of unplugging) Okay, it's unplugged. (pause) Waiting...

Agent: (pause) Alright, and while we're waiting, have you experienced any outages in your area recently? Or has anything changed with your setup?

Customer: Not that I'm aware of. I mean, there was a storm last night, but it wasn't anything crazy. Just some rain and wind.

Agent: That could potentially be related, actually. Weather can sometimes affect fiber connections. Okay, go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (sound of plugging in) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) It's booting up...

Agent: (pause) Good. Just let it fully boot up. That should take about a minute or two. You should see the lights coming back on.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see the power light again. Um... (longer pause) Hmm, the internet light still isn't turning on.

Agent: Still nothing? Okay, let's try a different approach. I'm going to walk you through a factory reset of the modem. This will clear any configurations that might be corrupted. Are you okay with that?

Customer: Will I lose my WiFi password and stuff?

Agent: You might need to reset your network name and password, yes. But we can help you reconfigure that after. Do you want to proceed?

Customer: Yeah, sure. Let's try it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so on the back of your modem, there should be a small reset button. It's usually recessed so you might need a pen or paperclip to press it.

Customer: Let me look... (pause) Yeah, I see it. I'm gonna grab a pen.

Agent: Go ahead.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm pressing it... (pause) How long do I hold it?

Agent: Hold it for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, holding it... (pause) Let go?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and release it. Now let's wait for it to fully restart. This might take a couple of minutes.

Customer: (pause) Alright. (longer pause) So while we're waiting... is this something that might be an issue on your end? Like, could there be something wrong with the line or service?

Agent: That's a good question. It's possible, though usually we'd see that in our system. Let me check... (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area, and your account is active and in good standing. But I can definitely check the status of your connection on our end. (pause) One moment...

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, so looking at your line here, it appears to be... hmm, that's odd. It's showing as inactive on the network side.

Customer: What does that mean?

Agent: It could mean the signal isn't reaching your modem from our equipment. That could be a line issue, or it could be something with the connection between our network and your home. (pause) The good news is we can send a technician out to check that.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet today.

Agent: Let me check availability... (typing sounds) (pause) I can get someone out there tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or there's an evening slot at 4 to 7 PM today. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Wait, let me check the modem one more time. (pause) Oh! Oh, I see something. There's a light flickering now. It's orange, I think? Is that good?

Agent: Orange is actually the network light searching for a connection. That might mean it's trying to reboot. Let's give it another minute.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (longer pause) Still orange. Still orange. (pause) Okay, now I'm seeing... wait, is it supposed to turn blue? It's turning blue!

Agent: That's excellent! You should be getting your connection back now. Let me have you test it. Can you try opening a web page or something on your laptop?

Customer: (pause) Uh, yeah, trying now. (longer pause) No, nothing. Still nothing. The page isn't loading.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, even though the light is showing blue now, we're still not getting a connection. (pause) Let me try one more thing on my end. Sometimes there's an authentication issue...

Customer: (background noise) It's still not working. This is... I really need this fixed.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for the trouble. Let me be honest with you—given that the line is showing as inactive on our network side and the light is blue but you're still not connecting, this is likely something that needs an in-person evaluation from our technical team. (pause) I really don't want to have you keep troubleshooting if it's a physical line issue.

Customer: So you're saying you can't fix this over the phone?

Agent: Based on what I'm seeing, I don't think this is something I can resolve remotely. The good news is we can get someone out to you. I can schedule that technician visit I mentioned. Would today's evening slot work for you, or would tomorrow morning be better?

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, tonight if possible. The 4 to 7 PM thing.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I have you booked for today between 4 and 7 PM. The technician's name will be James, and you'll receive a text confirmation with his contact information about an hour before he arrives.

Customer: Okay. And he'll be able to fix it?

Agent: He'll be able to diagnose what's going on and get you reconnected. If it's something simple, he can take care of it right there. If it's more complex, he'll work with our team to get you back online as quickly as possible.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate it, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Again, I'm sorry you're experiencing this. Is there anything else I can help clarify before you go?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... hopefully it gets fixed today.

Agent: Understood. Thank you for being patient with us, and we'll get your internet back up and running. Have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
