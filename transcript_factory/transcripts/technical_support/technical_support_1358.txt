Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so my internet just went out completely about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging everything and I'm just... I'm not really sure what else to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here real quick so we can get you sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm looking at your account now. It looks like you're on our Fiber 300 plan in the Riverside area, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right. We've had it for about two years now and it's been great, but this is the first time we've had any issues.

Agent: Got it. Well, let's see what we can figure out. First things first—can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Are there any lights on the modem?

Customer: Um, let me look. So the modem's over there... yeah, the power light is on, it's green. But the internet light—the white one—it's not on at all. It's just dark.

Agent: Okay, so the power is on but no internet light. That's helpful information. And how about the router? Do you have a separate router?

Customer: Oh yeah, I do. Let me check that too. (pause) The router's powered on but... I mean, none of the lights on it are lit up either. They're usually all blinking.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. So if the modem isn't connecting, the router won't be able to distribute a signal either. Let me ask you—have there been any storms in your area recently? Any power outages or anything like that?

Customer: Hmm, not that I know of. It was pretty nice earlier today, but now that you mention it, it is getting a little cloudy out. Nothing major though.

Agent: Okay. Well, what I'd like you to do is unplug the modem for about thirty seconds. Just pull the power cable out completely.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. While we're waiting, let me just check our systems here... (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area at the moment, so that's a good sign. Go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: Plugging it back in. (pause) Okay, it's back in. The power light just came back on, it's green again.

Agent: Perfect. Now let's give it about a minute to boot up and establish a connection to our network. Sometimes these things take a little time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm watching it. Still just the power light though. The internet light is still off. How long should it take usually?

Agent: Typically you'd see that internet light come on within about sixty to ninety seconds. Let's give it just a couple more seconds... (pause) Okay, still nothing on your end?

Customer: Nope, still just the one light.

Agent: Alright, that's unusual. Let me try a different approach. I'm going to send a reset command to your modem from our end here, and that should reboot it and try to re-establish the connection. This might take a few minutes, so just bear with me.

Customer: Okay, sounds good.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, I've sent the command. It should be processing now. Can you keep an eye on the modem and just let me know if anything changes?

Customer: Will do. (long pause) Okay, so... nothing's really happening. The modem's just... it's still the same.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let me check on my end to see if that command went through properly. (typing sounds) That's strange... it looks like the reset initiated, but I'm not seeing the modem check back in with us afterward. That could indicate a few different things. Let me ask you—is there anything plugged into the modem besides the power cable? Any ethernet cables?

Customer: Oh, yeah. There's an ethernet cable that goes from the modem to the router. Should I unplug that?

Agent: Actually, let's leave that connected for now. But let me have you try something else. Can you check the back of the modem and see if there's a small reset button? It might be recessed.

Customer: (pause) Um, yeah, I see it. There's a little button back here.

Agent: Okay, I want you to hold that button down for about ten seconds. Use something thin like a paperclip or a pen. Just press and hold it.

Customer: Got a pen right here. Okay, pushing it... (pause) ...holding... (pause) Okay, releasing it now.

Agent: Good. Now the modem should be doing a hard reset. This might take a couple minutes. Go ahead and watch for those lights again.

Customer: (pause) Okay... still just the green power light. Nothing else is coming on.

Agent: [inaudible] ...frustrating. Let me think here for a second. (pause) You know what, I want to make sure we're not missing something obvious. The modem is definitely getting power, right? The cable running into your wall—is that firmly connected?

Customer: Hold on, let me check. (pause) Yeah, I mean... it looks fine. It's going into the wall jack.

Agent: Okay. And you haven't changed anything with your setup recently? No new equipment or anything?

Customer: No, nothing at all. It was working fine this morning. I was streaming Netflix and everything was normal, and then it just... stopped.

Agent: Right. Well, okay, here's what I'm thinking. Because the modem isn't establishing that connection back with our network at all, even after the reset, there could be an issue on the line itself, or it's possible the modem is having a hardware failure. (typing sounds) I'm going to check our network diagnostics on our end to see if there's anything showing up... (pause) ...and it looks like we're not seeing any connection attempts from your modem at all, which is really unusual.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is my modem broken?

Agent: It could be, but I don't want to jump to conclusions just yet. I want to try one more thing if you don't mind. Do you have a smartphone that can access WiFi?

Customer: Yeah, I do.

Agent: Okay, can you open up your WiFi settings and tell me if you can see your router broadcasting any network names?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at the available networks and... no, nothing. I don't see ours at all. Nothing's showing up.

Agent: Right, which makes sense since the modem isn't connecting. But it's helpful to rule that out. Look, I think at this point we've pretty much exhausted the basic troubleshooting steps, and I'm concerned it might be a hardware issue with the modem. Unfortunately, what I can do is schedule a technician visit to come out and take a look at the line and the equipment. They'll be able to diagnose whether it's the modem itself or if there's an issue with our line coming into your house.

Customer: Oh man, really? How soon can someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... Okay, so we have openings tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM, or the day after that in the morning between 8 and 12. Which works better for you?

Customer: Uh, tomorrow afternoon would be better if that's available.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get you scheduled for tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. The technician will give you a call about thirty minutes before they arrive to confirm they're on the way. You should also receive a confirmation email and a text message to the number on your account.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that works. Is there any charge for this?

Agent: Since we haven't confirmed a problem yet, there's no diagnostic fee. If it turns out to be a modem issue, we can discuss your options—whether that's repairing or replacing it—at that time.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. So there's nothing else I can do in the meantime?

Agent: Unfortunately, at this point I think we've done everything we can from the troubleshooting side. You're welcome to try unplugging everything again and waiting a bit longer if you want, but based on what we're seeing, I think we need boots on the ground to figure this out. I'm really sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone for you.

Customer: Yeah, I understand. It's just frustrating, you know? I need my internet for work.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry about that. Hopefully the technician will be able to get you back up and running tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome! Thanks for being patient with me, and I'm sorry we couldn't solve this one remotely. You should receive that confirmation shortly, and remember, the tech will call you about thirty minutes before arrival tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
