Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. Um, I'm calling because my internet just went out about an hour ago and I've been without service ever since.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! I'd be happy to help you get back online. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. And just to confirm, this is for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Alright, perfect. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have you had any recent storms in your area, or has anything else unusual happened today?

Customer: No, no storms or anything. It was just working fine this morning, and then around... I don't know, 2 o'clock, it just died on me.

Agent: Okay, and just so I understand what you're experiencing right now—when you say it went out, are you seeing any lights on your modem or router?

Customer: Um... (pause) Let me walk over there real quick. (background noise) Yeah, so the modem has... it's got like a couple of lights on it, but they're red. Like, they're not the normal green ones that are usually on.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing red lights instead of the normal green. That's helpful. Can you tell me which lights are red? Is it the power light, the internet light...?

Customer: I'm not totally sure, to be honest. There's just... red lights. Maybe two of them?

Agent: No problem, no problem. Let me walk you through this. First, I want you to unplug the modem from the power outlet. Just give it a good unplug.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Done.

Agent: Great. Now I want you to wait about 30 seconds while it powers down completely. Just give it a minute to be safe.

Customer: Alright, I'm waiting... (long pause) Okay, it's been like a minute now.

Agent: Perfect. Now go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: Plugging it back in... (pause) Okay, it's back in. (pause) The lights are... they're still red though.

Agent: Still red. Okay. Um, that's unusual. Can you give it maybe another 30 seconds to fully boot back up? Sometimes it takes a moment after a reset.

Customer: Sure, I'll just... (pause) Yeah, I'm watching it. The red lights are still there though. It doesn't look like it's changing.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Let me ask you this—do you have a separate wireless router, or is your modem all-in-one?

Customer: I think it's all-in-one? It's the unit you guys provided.

Agent: Right, okay. So the modem and router are one device. Um, I'm going to check our system here to see if there are any service issues in your area. (typing sounds) Let me just pull that up real quick... (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any major outages reported in your area at this time, which is good news and bad news, I guess.

Customer: (nervous laugh) What's the bad news?

Agent: Well, the bad news is it means the issue is likely with your modem or something on your connection. But let me dig a little deeper. Can you tell me—when you're looking at the modem, is there any kind of display screen or just the lights?

Customer: Just the lights as far as I can tell.

Agent: Okay. And the ethernet cable—is that plugged into the wall properly?

Customer: The ethernet cable? I... which one is that?

Agent: So there should be a cable that goes from your wall outlet into the modem. It looks kind of like a phone cord but a little bigger. Does that make sense?

Customer: Oh! Oh yeah, I see it. It's in there, yeah. It's definitely plugged in.

Agent: Good, good. And you're not aware of anyone unplugging anything or moving the modem recently?

Customer: No, nothing like that. Everything's been the same.

Agent: Alright. Okay, I'm going to have you try one more thing for me, and then we might need to get a technician out there. I want you to try unplugging the modem again, but this time, I also want you to unplug your router if you have a separate one.

Customer: I thought it was all-in-one?

Agent: Right, it is, so you'll just be unplugging that one device again. I want you to leave it unplugged for about two minutes this time. A longer reset.

Customer: Two minutes? Okay... (pause) Unplugging it now. (pause) It's unplugged. I guess I'll just... wait?

Agent: Exactly. Just wait about two minutes. I can stay on the line with you if you'd like, or—

Customer: No, it's fine, I'll wait. I'll just... I don't know, check my phone or something.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, just to pass the time, let me check a few more things on your account here...

Customer: (after a long pause) Okay, it's been about two minutes. Should I plug it back in?

Agent: Yes, go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it in... (pause) Alright, it's back in. (pause) Hmm. Red lights again.

Agent: Still the red lights. Okay, um... (pause) That's... that's not what I was hoping for. So here's the thing. When you see those red lights, it typically indicates either a power issue or a connection issue to our network. And normally, a reset like that would fix it. The fact that it's not responding is telling me that there might be an issue with the line itself, or possibly the modem has gone bad.

Customer: Oh no. Does that mean I need a new modem?

Agent: It might be, yeah. Or it could be something on the line. Unfortunately, I'm not able to diagnose that fully from here without some specialized equipment. I think what we need to do is get a technician out to your place. They can check the line, the connection, all of that, and determine exactly what's going on.

Customer: How long would that take? Like, when could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at our next available appointments. We have someone who could potentially come out tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we have Friday afternoon as well.

Customer: Tomorrow would be better than Friday. That's the 15th, right?

Agent: (pause) Yes, tomorrow would be the 15th. Would the 1 to 5 PM window work for you?

Customer: I guess so, yeah. I mean, I don't have a choice, do I? (nervous laugh) I need my internet.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm putting in a work order now. The technician will arrive sometime between 1 and 5 PM tomorrow. Can you make sure someone's home during that time?

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here all day anyway since I can't work without internet.

Agent: Right, of course. Okay, so you're all set. You should receive a confirmation text and email with the details. Is the best number to reach you the one you called from?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. And just in case—if the internet miraculously comes back on before the technician arrives, you can call us back and we can cancel the appointment. But based on what we've seen, I'd say you're probably going to need that visit.

Customer: Okay... (sigh) Well, I guess that's better than nothing. So tomorrow between 1 and 5 then?

Agent: That's correct. And if you have any other issues or questions, don't hesitate to call back. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope they can fix it.

Agent: I hope so too. I'm sorry you're dealing with this. We really appreciate your business, and we'll get you back up and running as soon as we can. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good day.

Customer: Thank you. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
