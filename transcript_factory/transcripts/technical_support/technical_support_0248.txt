# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I've been trying to figure it out on my own but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: Robert Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Robert. I've got you here. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? Do you remember what time that was?

Customer: Yeah, sometime around like 8 or 9. I was working from home and just... it just stopped. All the lights went out on my router.

Agent: Okay. And have you had a chance to restart the modem and router yet?

Customer: I did, yeah. I unplugged it for like thirty seconds and plugged it back in. The lights came back on but... still nothing. Like, I don't have any internet.

Agent: Alright, that's a good first step. So when you say the lights are on, which lights are you seeing? Are you seeing the power light?

Customer: Uh, yeah, the power light's on. I think there's like a green light... or was it blue? There's definitely a light on. But there's no... what's it called... the internet light? That one's not on.

Agent: Right, so the internet light should be solid green typically. If that's not lit up, that indicates a connection issue on our end. Let me check your service here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your line right now. Have you noticed any weather in your area today? Any storms or anything like that?

Customer: No, it's been pretty clear actually. Why, does that affect it?

Agent: It can sometimes, yeah. Occasionally weather events can impact the line. But it sounds like clear skies on your end. Let me pull up your modem information. What model modem are you using? It should be labeled on the device.

Customer: (pause) Uh, let me look... (background noise) It says... Arris? I think it's an Arris SB something. SB8200 maybe?

Agent: Okay, the SB8200, that's a good modem. Let me try something here. I'm going to send a restart signal to your modem. Give it about two minutes and it should reboot on its own. Don't manually restart it this time, okay?

Customer: Okay, so I just... wait?

Agent: Yeah, just wait. I'm sending the command now. (typing sounds) It's queued up. Give it about ninety seconds to two minutes, and then check if those lights come back online.

Customer: (pause) ...Alright. I'm gonna... I'm just sitting here looking at it. (long pause) Okay, so the power light's back. Still no internet light though.

Agent: Hmm, okay. And you're not seeing any amber or red lights on there either?

Customer: No, just the power. Everything else is dark.

Agent: Alright. Let me check the upstream and downstream here. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm seeing some issues on our end with the signal. Robert, how long have you been a customer with us?

Customer: Oh, I don't know, maybe like three years? Something like that.

Agent: Okay, and this is the first time you've had this issue?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, nothing like this. It's usually pretty reliable, honestly.

Agent: I appreciate that. Let me take a look at the line history. (pause) I'm going to try one more thing. Can you check the cable connections on the back of the modem? Make sure the coaxial cable—that's the cable coming from the wall—is screwed in tight?

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, let me just... (pause) ...reach back there. (pause) Yeah, it looks... it feels pretty snug. I mean, I don't think I can really tighten it much more.

Agent: Okay, and then there's also an Ethernet cable potentially, if you're using a wired connection?

Customer: Oh, um, no, I'm using WiFi. But my router's separate. Should I check that too?

Agent: Actually, wait—your router's separate? So you have a modem and then a separate router?

Customer: Yeah, I got a WiFi router. Didn't that come with everything or...?

Agent: No, that's actually helpful information. So the modem I'm looking at in our system is the SB8200, but you're connecting through a router after that. Is that router powered on?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it should be. Let me look at it again. (background noise) No, actually... I don't see any lights on the router at all.

Agent: Ah, okay. Is the router plugged in?

Customer: (pause) ...Oh. Oh no. (nervous laugh) I think... yeah, the cable's not... it's not connected. It's just sitting there. I don't know how that happened. Let me plug it in.

Agent: (chuckles) Hey, it happens. Go ahead.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm plugging it in now. (pause) Okay, power's on... lights are coming on... (pause) Let me try to connect to WiFi on my laptop. (longer pause) I'm seeing my network... connecting... (pause) ...it's loading... (longer pause) Hmm.

Agent: Is it connecting?

Customer: It connected but I'm not getting internet. It says I'm connected to the network but no internet.

Agent: Okay, so the router's connecting but not getting internet from the modem. Let me go back to the modem. Are you seeing that internet light on the modem now?

Customer: (pause) No. Still nothing. It's just the power light.

Agent: Alright. Let me check the line again. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing a signal coming from the node on our end. This might be something that needs a technician to look at. Let me try one more diagnostic. I'm going to run a line test. (pause) Give me just a second here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, running the test now.

Customer: So what does that mean? Like, is it on your end?

Agent: It could be. There might be an issue with the line coming into your house, or it could be something at the node in your area. The test will help us figure that out.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay.

Agent: (longer pause) (typing sounds) Okay, the test came back and I'm seeing signal degradation on the line. This typically indicates either a problem with the external line or potentially the network interface device at your house. Unfortunately, I'm not able to resolve this remotely.

Customer: So... what does that mean?

Agent: It means we're going to need to send a technician out to your location. They can check the line, check the equipment, and get you back up and running. How does your availability look? Are you home most days?

Customer: Yeah, I'm home. I work from home, so... when could a technician come out?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) We have availability tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM, or we have Thursday afternoon, same window. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow, if that's possible. I really need this working.

Agent: I totally understand. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) I'm putting you down for tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. The technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive. You should receive a confirmation text and email as well.

Customer: Okay, great. And they'll be able to fix it?

Agent: They'll diagnose the issue and resolve it if possible. If there's something more complex, they'll communicate that with you. The good news is most of these line issues are pretty straightforward to fix.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate it. Sorry about the WiFi router thing.

Agent: (chuckles) No worries at all, Robert. That happens more often than you'd think. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. We really appreciate your business, and sorry for the inconvenience today. A technician will be out tomorrow, and we'll have you back online as soon as possible. Thanks for calling Frontier.

Customer: Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Take care.
