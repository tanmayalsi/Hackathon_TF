Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, so my internet just went out completely about an hour ago and I can't get it back on. I've tried unplugging the modem and everything but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that! We'll get this sorted out for you. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I'm seeing an account for Michael Chen at 447 Riverside Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned the internet went out about an hour ago. Have you had any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The power's fine, all my other stuff is working. It's just... the internet's completely dead. The modem's not lighting up or anything.

Agent: Alright, let's start with some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what color the lights on your modem are right now?

Customer: Um... they're not on. Like, I don't see any lights at all. It's just dark.

Agent: Okay, so the modem's powered off. Let's get that back on. Can you locate the power cable in the back of the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's plugged in.

Agent: Alright, and you mentioned you already tried unplugging it. When you did that, how long did you leave it unplugged for?

Customer: Maybe like... thirty seconds? I plugged it back in pretty quick.

Agent: Let's try that again, but this time we'll leave it unplugged for a full two minutes. That'll do a complete reset. Can you go ahead and unplug it now?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, unplugging it now.

Agent: Great. I'm gonna have you wait two minutes while it's unplugged. I'll be right here on the line with you.

Customer: Okay... (pause) So is this normal? Like, should this happen?

Agent: It can happen from time to time. Sometimes the modem just needs a reset to clear out any errors. We see it pretty frequently, actually. You doing alright?

Customer: Yeah, I'm fine. It's just frustrating because I was in the middle of working from home and... (pause) Okay, I think two minutes are up.

Agent: Perfect. Go ahead and plug it back in for me.

Customer: Okay, plugging it in now. (pause) Alright, it's in.

Agent: Good. Now we're gonna wait about three to five minutes for the modem to fully boot up. The lights should start coming on. What you're looking for is a solid green light, usually labeled "Internet" or sometimes "Online."

Customer: Okay, I'll keep an eye on it. (long pause) Um... still nothing. Just... still dark.

Agent: Hmm, nothing yet? Okay. When you look at the power button on the modem itself, does it feel warm to the touch?

Customer: (pause) Actually, yeah. It's pretty warm.

Agent: It's quite warm?

Customer: Yeah, it's hot actually. Like, uncomfortably hot.

Agent: Okay, that's not ideal. That could indicate a power supply issue. Let me pull up your account here and check if there have been any recent service alerts on your line. (typing sounds) 

Customer: Is that bad? Can you fix it remotely or...?

Agent: (pause) Let me see here... (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area, and your line looks active on our end. But if the modem itself is too hot to touch, that's usually a sign that the power adapter is failing.

Customer: So what do I do? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: Well, before we go down that road, let's try one more thing. Do you have a different power outlet you could try? Sometimes a faulty outlet can cause similar issues.

Customer: Yeah, I can try that. Let me... (pause) unplug it again and move it over here. (pause) Okay, I've got it in a different outlet now.

Agent: Good. Go ahead and plug it in.

Customer: (pause) It's in. (longer pause) Nope, same thing. No lights. And it's getting hot again pretty quickly.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I think we might be looking at a hardware issue with the modem itself. Let me check what we can do for you. Can you give me one moment?

Customer: Yeah, take your time.

Agent: (hold music, approximately 45 seconds) Thanks for holding. Okay, so here's what I'm seeing. We can definitely get you a replacement modem shipped out. That would take about three to five business days. In the meantime, unfortunately, you wouldn't have internet access.

Customer: Three to five days? I work from home, man. I need internet. Can't someone come out and like... can't you just fix this faster?

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry about that. Let me see if we have any expedited options. (typing sounds) We do have a same-day or next-day service call option available, but there would be a technician service fee of about seventy-five dollars for that.

Customer: So either I'm without internet for five days or I pay seventy-five bucks?

Agent: I know it's frustrating. If you go with the replacement modem shipped to you, there's no service fee. But if you need internet sooner, a tech visit would get you up and running today or tomorrow. Let me also check... (typing sounds) ...if there are any other troubleshooting steps we haven't tried yet.

Customer: Yeah, please do. I'd rather not pay if I don't have to.

Agent: Okay, give me just a second here. (pause) Have you tried accessing the modem through a different power source? Like, do you have a battery backup system or a different outlet?

Customer: I already tried that.

Agent: Right, you did. Um... (pause) Okay, and the modem is definitely from us, not a third-party device?

Customer: No, it's yours. You guys installed it.

Agent: Okay. I've gone through all the standard troubleshooting steps here, and unfortunately, given that the power adapter is getting dangerously hot and there are no lights coming on, I believe we're looking at a defective unit. There's really nothing else I can safely have you try.

Customer: (sighs) So what are my options then?

Agent: Your best options are the replacement modem shipped out, or we can schedule that technician visit. The tech can also potentially check your line and make sure there's nothing else going on that contributed to this failure.

Customer: How much longer is that gonna take on the phone?

Agent: The tech visit? If you call it in today, we might be able to get someone out tomorrow morning, possibly even later today depending on availability in your area.

Customer: And if I just wait for the modem?

Agent: Five business days, and that's pretty standard shipping. You'd get it and you could install it yourself, which is pretty straightforward.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, I'll... I'll schedule the tech visit. I just can't be without internet that long.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me get that set up for you. Can I put you through to our scheduling team? They'll get you all sorted out.

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. Just to recap before I transfer you, we've determined that your modem's power adapter is likely defective, the standard troubleshooting didn't resolve the issue, and you're opting for the expedited technician visit at the service fee of seventy-five dollars. Is all of that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. I'm gonna transfer you now. Your wait time should be under two minutes. Thank you for your patience today, Michael, and we're sorry for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Transferring you now. (dial tones, call transfers)
