Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging everything and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at... and I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. Got it. So the internet went down this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, around 8 AM. I was working from home and just... it just stopped working. And I need it back up ASAP because I have meetings this afternoon.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you seeing any lights on your modem right now? Like, is it powered on?

Customer: Um, yeah. It's on. I see the lights. There's a... there's a blue light and then there's like a red light blinking. Is that bad?

Agent: Okay, so the red light blinking is actually what we want to troubleshoot. That usually means it's not connecting to our network. Let me walk you through a few steps. First, can you unplug the modem for about 30 seconds and then plug it back in?

Customer: (pause) Sure, yeah. Okay, I'm unplugging it now.

Agent: Perfect. Just give it about 30 seconds while it's unplugged.

Customer: (background noise of waiting) Okay... it's been 30 seconds.

Agent: Great, go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: Alright, plugging it back in now. (pause) Um... I'm waiting for it to boot up. (pause) Still the same thing. Blue light and then that red blinking light.

Agent: Okay, that didn't resolve it. Let me check something on our end. (typing sounds) I'm going to check if there's an outage in your area or any issues we're experiencing...

Customer: Is there an outage? Because my neighbors' internet looked like it was working yesterday...

Agent: Let me see here. No, I'm not showing any outages in your area code. So it's not a widespread issue. Can you tell me... do you have a router as well, or are you using just the modem?

Customer: I have both. There's a modem and a router.

Agent: Okay, good. And the router, is that powered on?

Customer: Yeah, it's on too. No lights on it though. Usually it has some lights and I'm not seeing anything.

Agent: Okay, so the router isn't lighting up at all. That could be part of the issue. Can you check the cable that goes from the modem to the router? Make sure it's... it's plugged in on both ends?

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, let me check. (pause) Um, it looks plugged in. It's tight on both sides.

Agent: Okay. And you're using an ethernet cable, correct?

Customer: Yeah, ethernet. Yellow cable.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, here's what I want to try. Can you unplug that ethernet cable from the modem, wait about 10 seconds, and plug it back in?

Customer: Sure. (pause) Doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged. Ten seconds... (pause) Plugging it back in.

Agent: (pause) Alright, now give the router a moment to power back up. You should see lights come on the router within about 30 seconds.

Customer: (waiting sounds) ...Nothing. Still nothing on the router.

Agent: Hmm. Okay. Can you try unplugging the router for about 30 seconds and plugging that back in as well?

Customer: Yeah, okay. (pause) Unplugging it now. (pause) This is frustrating, man. I really need to get this working.

Agent: I understand. We'll get through this. Just give it those 30 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been 30 seconds. Plugging it back in. (pause) Nope. Still... still nothing. The modem still has that red light blinking.

Agent: Let me put you on a brief hold while I escalate this to our technical team to see if there might be an issue with your modem itself. This should just take a moment.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: (hold music plays and then stops) Thank you for holding. I've escalated your case. I'm looking at some notes here from our technical team. The red blinking light combined with the router not powering up is typically indicating either a modem failure or a connection issue on our line. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it remotely or...?

Agent: Unfortunately, based on what we're seeing, we likely need to get a technician out to your location to diagnose the issue with the line itself or potentially replace the modem. But before we schedule that, I want to try one more thing. Can you check the power cable on the modem? Make sure it's fully inserted into the wall outlet and the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's plugged in. It's definitely plugged in. I tried a different outlet too earlier.

Agent: Okay, so you already tried that. (pause) Alright, let me see what we can do here. I can schedule a technician to come out. They'd be able to come by tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have a later window on Thursday from 1 to 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better. But I really need this working today if possible. Is there anything else we can try?

Agent: I wish I had better news. We've gone through all the remote troubleshooting steps I have available, and all signs are pointing to either a hardware failure with your modem or an issue with the line that'll require hands-on diagnosis. The technician will be able to determine exactly what's going on and get you up and running.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, I guess tomorrow morning it is. But this is... I really needed this to work today.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry we weren't able to get it resolved over the phone. The good news is our technicians are really skilled at getting these sorted quickly. Let me just confirm that appointment for you. That's tomorrow, [inaudible], between 8 and 12 PM, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. We'll have a technician out to you then. You should receive a confirmation text and email shortly with all the details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's it. Hopefully this gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: We'll definitely get you back online as soon as possible. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: You take care.
