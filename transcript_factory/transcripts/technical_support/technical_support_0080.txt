# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you out here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up for you... Alright, I see your account here. You're on our Fiber 100 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So when you say the internet's been down since this morning, have you had any recent storms or power outages in your area?

Customer: Not that I know of. The power's been fine all morning. It's just the internet that went out.

Agent: Okay, and are any of your lights on the modem or router showing anything unusual? Like, are they lit up at all, or is everything just dark?

Customer: (pause) Um, let me go look at it. (background noise of footsteps) Okay, so the modem has a red light on it. Just one red light, and everything else is... it looks like it's off.

Agent: A red light typically indicates there's no connection coming in from our network. That's actually helpful to know. And you mentioned the other lights are off?

Customer: Yeah, yeah. The router too. Everything's basically just... dark except for that one red light.

Agent: Alright. Have you tried unplugging the modem and leaving it unplugged for about 30 seconds, then plugging it back in? Sometimes that can clear things up.

Customer: No, I haven't. Should I do that now?

Agent: Yes, if you don't mind. Go ahead and do that for me.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Alright, I'll wait like you said. (longer pause) Okay, plugging it back in.

Agent: Perfect. Now this might take a couple minutes to fully boot back up. While we wait, let me ask you—have you made any changes to your setup recently? Any new equipment or anything like that?

Customer: Uh, no. Nothing that I did. Although, now that you mention it, there was a Frontier technician out here about a week ago to upgrade some stuff. But everything was working fine after that.

Agent: Okay, that's good context. (typing sounds) And you've had no issues since then until this morning?

Customer: Right, no issues at all. It was working fine when I went to bed last night.

Agent: (pause) Alright, so typically we should be seeing some lights come back on by now. How's it looking on your end?

Customer: (pause) Um... still just the red light. Everything else is still dark.

Agent: Still just the red one, okay. That's unusual. Let me try a couple other things here. Can you check the cable connections for me? The cable going into the modem and coming out of the wall—just make sure they're both plugged in firmly?

Customer: (background noise) Okay, checking now. (pause) Yeah, the one from the wall is definitely plugged in. And the one going into the modem, too. They both feel pretty solid.

Agent: Good. Alright, and does your modem have a battery backup on it by chance?

Customer: (pause) I... I'm not sure. How would I tell?

Agent: There would typically be a button or a switch on the back or bottom of the unit. Does it have anything like that?

Customer: (background noise) Let me flip it around. (pause) I see a power button, but... I don't think there's anything else. No battery backup thing.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. No battery backup. Let me just do a quick check on our end to see if there's any service issues in your area. (typing sounds) (pause) Hmm. So I'm not seeing any reported outages in your neighborhood, which is odd given what we're seeing with your modem.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it could be a few things. The modem might have an internal issue, or there could be a problem with the line coming into your house. I'm wondering if maybe a technician should come out and take a look at it physically.

Customer: Okay, but like... is there anything else we can try first? I just got through on the phone and I'm trying to avoid a service call if I can.

Agent: I understand. Um, let me try one more thing. Can you hold the reset button on the modem for about ten seconds? There should be a small button, might be recessed. You might need a pen or something to press it.

Customer: (background noise) Hold on, I'm looking for it. (pause) Okay, I think I found it. It's on the back. (pause) Alright, holding it down... (longer pause) Okay, I've been holding it for about ten seconds.

Agent: Good. Now let's give it a minute or two to fully reset and reboot.

Customer: (pause) Okay. So we're just waiting?

Agent: Yes, just waiting. While we do, I can actually get a technician scheduled for you, just in case. That way, if this doesn't work, we're already on the books and we can get someone out here as soon as possible.

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, alright. How soon could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Looking at the schedule... I can get someone out there tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need this working today if possible.

Agent: I totally understand. Let me see if there's an emergency slot available... (typing sounds) (pause) Unfortunately, it looks like today's pretty booked up. Tomorrow's the earliest I can get someone out there.

Customer: [inaudible] That's frustrating. Alright, fine. Tomorrow then.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. But hey, let me check your modem one more time. Are you seeing any changes with the lights?

Customer: (pause) No, it's... it's still just that red light. Nothing's changed.

Agent: Alright. Unfortunately, this is pointing to something that's going to need hands-on troubleshooting from our technician. I'm going to go ahead and lock in that appointment for tomorrow between 12 and 4 PM. Your confirmation number is 834621. Do you have a pen?

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (pause) Okay, go ahead.

Agent: 834621. I'll also send you a confirmation email and text message with all the details. Is the phone number and email address on your account still current?

Customer: Yeah, they should be.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know what to expect: the technician will check the modem, the lines, and potentially the connection point outside your house. Depending on what they find, they might need to do some repairs or equipment replacement. But they'll be able to diagnose exactly what's going on.

Customer: Okay. So I'm just without internet until tomorrow?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. I really am sorry about that. I know this isn't ideal. But the good news is our technician should be able to get this resolved for you pretty quickly tomorrow.

Customer: Alright. Well... I guess that's all we can do then.

Agent: I really wish I could get it working over the phone for you today. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding the appointment?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. Just get someone out here tomorrow, I guess.

Agent: Absolutely. We'll take care of you. Again, your confirmation number is 834621, and someone will be there between 12 and 4 PM tomorrow. If you have any questions before then, you can always give us a call back.

Customer: Okay. Thanks for trying, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We really appreciate your patience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
