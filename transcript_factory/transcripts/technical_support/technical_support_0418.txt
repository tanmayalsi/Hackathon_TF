Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, uh, my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it working. I've got work calls starting in like twenty minutes.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that must be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847. That's my cell phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing service at 412 Maple Street, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So, internet service isn't working as of this morning. Have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time?

Customer: No, first time. Everything was fine last night. I woke up this morning and tried to check my email and nothing. It's completely dead.

Agent: Okay, I hear you. Let's run through some basic troubleshooting. First, can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Is the modem powered on?

Customer: Yeah, the modem's on. I can see... let me look at it... the power light is on, but I think the internet light is red or orange or something. It's definitely not green.

Agent: That's helpful information. And the router—do you have a separate router, or are you using the modem's built-in WiFi?

Customer: I've got a separate router. It's sitting right next to the modem.

Agent: Okay, perfect. Can you check if the router is powered on as well?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's on. The lights are on, but... hmm, I'm not sure they're all lit up the way they usually are.

Agent: Right. So what I'd like you to do is unplug the modem first. Just pull the power cable out of the back.

Customer: Okay, doing that now. It's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Now let's wait about thirty seconds for it to fully power down. (pause) Go ahead and count it out if you want, or I can wait here.

Customer: (pause) Okay, thirty seconds should be up.

Agent: Perfect. Now plug the modem back in and let's give it a minute or so to fully restart. You should see the lights cycle through as it boots back up.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's plugged back in. The power light came on right away... (pause) ...and now I see some other lights starting to flash.

Agent: Excellent. That's what we want to see. Now, while we're waiting for that to stabilize, go ahead and do the same thing with the router. Unplug it for about thirty seconds.

Customer: Okay. (pause) Unplugging now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: (typing sounds) While we're waiting, let me check a few things on my end. (pause) Okay, I'm not showing any outages in your area currently, which is good news. And your modem is showing as active on our network.

Customer: Oh, okay. So it might just be the router then?

Agent: Well, possibly, but let's finish this restart and see where we're at. Go ahead and plug the router back in.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's plugged back in. (pause) Okay, the lights are coming back on... and... (long pause) ...hmm, okay so the power light is on, but I'm still not seeing... I don't think the internet light is green. It's still kind of... it looks orange or amber or something.

Agent: Alright, can you tell me what color all the lights are? Just run through them for me.

Customer: Um, okay. So there's a power light—that's green. Then there's like... I think it says "internet" or maybe "WAN"? That one's definitely orange. And then there's like two more that are... they're kind of flickering between off and on.

Agent: Okay, so that orange light on the internet or WAN port—that's the key one. That should be solid green when everything's connected properly. The fact that it's orange tells me the router isn't getting a signal from the modem.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it the router?

Agent: Not necessarily. Let me have you check the connection between the modem and the router. Can you see the cable that connects them?

Customer: Yeah, I can see it. I'm looking at it right now.

Agent: Okay, can you unplug it from the modem side and then plug it back in firmly? Just make sure it clicks all the way in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm unplugging it... (pause) ...and plugging it back in. It seems pretty snug. I mean, it's in there.

Agent: And on the router side, can you check that connection too?

Customer: Yeah, let me see... (pause) This one's plugged in too.

Agent: Great. Now let's give it another minute for them to reconnect with each other. (pause) While we wait, I'm going to ask you a couple of other questions. Have there been any storms in your area recently? Any weather events?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been clear all week.

Agent: And you haven't made any changes to your setup? No new devices added or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing. Same setup as always.

Agent: Okay, let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) (pause) So I'm looking at your account history and... (pause) ...actually, I am seeing that your modem did lose connection to our network around 6:47 this morning. It's been offline since then.

Customer: Okay, so what does that mean? Is it something with the modem itself?

Agent: That's what we need to figure out. Can you tell me what model modem you have? You can usually find it on a sticker on the back.

Customer: (pause) It's a... Frontier... model number... [inaudible]... looks like FI-GW-3...something. I can't quite read the last part.

Agent: That's okay, I can look that up. The FI-GW is what I need. Now, at this point, I want to try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? This will wipe all the settings and restore it to factory defaults.

Customer: Wait, will that... I mean, will I have to reset everything? My WiFi password and all that?

Agent: That's a good question. Yes, you would need to set up your WiFi again, but given that we're not even getting an internet connection right now, we need to rule out a software issue. But let's only do that if you're comfortable with it.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, let's try it. What do I do?

Agent: There should be a small reset button on the back of the modem. You'll need something like a paperclip to press it—hold it in for about ten to fifteen seconds while the modem is powered on.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I found it. I've got a paperclip. (pause) Okay, I'm pressing it and holding it... (pause) The lights just went out. (pause) Okay, they're starting to come back on.

Agent: Perfect. Now this is going to take a couple minutes to fully reboot and reinitialize. Why don't we wait a few moments and then check the status.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, it's been a couple minutes. The power light is green again, but... (pause) ...that WAN light is still orange. The internet light is still not green.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's... that's concerning. Let me check something. (typing sounds) (pause) [inaudible] (pause) Okay, so after the reset, the modem should have automatically reconnected to our network, but I'm still not seeing it come back online. That suggests there might be a hardware issue with the modem itself, or possibly an issue with the line coming into your house.

Customer: So what does that mean? How do I fix it?

Agent: Well, the first thing I'd recommend is checking if there's a cable that comes from outside your house into the modem. It's usually a coaxial cable—looks kind of like an antenna cable. Can you locate that?

Customer: Um, yeah, I think so. There's a cable that comes through the wall right over there. Is that it?

Agent: That's likely it. Can you trace where it connects to the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it's connected to... it looks like the "in" port on the back of the modem.

Agent: Good, okay. Can you unplug that cable and check if the connector looks clean? Sometimes debris or damage can cause connection issues.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I've unplugged it. (pause) It looks... I mean, it looks okay to me. I don't see any damage or anything. It's pretty clean.

Agent: Alright, go ahead and plug it back in. Make sure it's tight.

Customer: (pause) Okay, it's plugged back in. (pause) But nothing's changed. The light's still orange.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I understand this is frustrating. At this point, I've exhausted most of the basic troubleshooting steps I can do remotely. The modem isn't reconnecting to our network even after a factory reset, and the issue persists even after reseating all the cables. 

Customer: So what does that mean? Am I just stuck without internet?

Agent: Not at all. What I'd like to do is get a technician out to your location. They can diagnose whether it's a hardware issue with the modem, a line issue, or something else. Let me see what's available.

Customer: How long would that take? I really need internet today.

Agent: I understand. Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) I can get someone out to you today, actually. I have an appointment available this afternoon between 2 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) That's... yeah, that could work. But that's still a couple hours. I have work calls I need to do.

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately, that's the earliest I can get someone there today. If something opens up sooner, I can put you on the priority list and give you a call. Would that be acceptable?

Customer: (long pause) Yeah, okay, I guess I'll have to make it work. Can I get a confirmation on that appointment?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me get that set up for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I have a technician appointment for today, 412 Maple Street, between 2 and 4 PM. I'm going to send a confirmation to the number on your account. You should receive that shortly via email and text.

Customer: Okay, thank you. Is there anything else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: Unfortunately, we've covered all the main troubleshooting steps. The best thing to do at this point is just to let the equipment rest until the technician arrives. Don't keep trying to restart it, as that can sometimes make things worse.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate your help anyway, Marcus.

Agent: Of course, I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved over the phone. The technician should be able to take care of this for you this afternoon. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We really appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day!
