Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So my internet's been down since this morning and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the router and everything.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get this sorted out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see your service address is on Maple Street in Boise. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned you unplugged the router already—that's a good first step. Let me ask you a few questions. When you say the internet isn't working, do you see any lights on the modem or router at all?

Customer: Um, yeah. The modem has a red light on it. It's been red all morning.

Agent: Okay, so the red light typically means there's no connection coming into your modem. Before we go further, have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: No, this is the first time. The internet was working fine yesterday. I woke up this morning and it was just... gone.

Agent: (pause) Alright. Let me check our system here to see if there are any known outages in your neighborhood. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm not seeing any reported outages on our end in your area right now.

Customer: So what does that mean? Is it my equipment?

Agent: Well, that's what we're going to figure out. So I want you to try a few things for me. First, can you locate your modem? It should be a small box, usually black or white.

Customer: Yeah, I see it. It's right here next to the router.

Agent: Perfect. Now I need you to unplug the power cable from the back of the modem—the one that goes into the wall outlet—and just hold it unplugged for about 30 seconds. Can you do that?

Customer: (pause) Okay... unplugging it now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just... go ahead and hold it there for a few more seconds... (pause) Alright, now go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugging it back in. (pause) Hmm, the lights are... they're cycling through some different colors. We got green, blue... okay, now we're back to red.

Agent: Still red? Okay, that's interesting. (pause) Let me ask you—is there a cable that runs into your modem from the wall? Like a coaxial cable?

Customer: A... coaxial cable? I'm not really sure. There's a cable that comes from the outlet in the wall, yeah.

Agent: Right, okay. Can you check if that cable is plugged in securely? It should look like a thick cable, kind of silver-ish color, with a connector on the end.

Customer: (pause) Oh, um... it's plugged in. Yeah, it looks pretty secure to me.

Agent: Alright. And let me just double-check—you've got power going to the modem, right? Like the device is actually turning on?

Customer: Yeah, it's definitely on. I can see the power light and everything. It's just that red indicator light that won't go away.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm making some notes here. You know what, let me try to send a signal to your modem from our end and see if we get any response. (pause) Give me just a moment... (longer pause) Okay, I'm not getting a response from your modem, which usually means the signal isn't making it to your device from our equipment.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Is my modem broken?

Agent: It could be a few things. It could be the modem, or it could be that the line coming into your house is disrupted somehow. Um, let me try one more thing. Can you check your router too? Is that powered on?

Customer: Yeah, the router's on. But I mean, if the modem's not working, the router wouldn't work anyway, right?

Agent: That's actually a really good point, yes. You're right. (pause) Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I've tried the standard troubleshooting steps, we've got no outages in your area, and the modem's not responding to our signal. At this point, I think we might be looking at either a hardware issue with your modem or possibly a line issue that I can't diagnose from here.

Customer: So what do I do? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: Well, that's one possibility. But before we go down that road, I'd really like to have one of our technicians come out and take a look. They can check the connection coming into your house and test your equipment properly. Would you be available for a technician visit?

Customer: When would that be? I really need to get this working. I work from home.

Agent: (typing sounds) I completely understand. Let me see what we have available. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at our schedule and... we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could do sometime next week, maybe Wednesday or Thursday.

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be better if possible. I can't really be without internet for a whole week.

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 and noon. The technician will bring a replacement modem just in case, and they'll check all the lines coming into your home.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I just... I really hope it gets fixed tomorrow.

Agent: I understand completely. Before you go, let me just confirm your contact number one more time so the technician can reach you if needed. Is 555-0147 still the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yes, that's my cell phone, so I'll have it on me.

Agent: Perfect. And your appointment is confirmed for tomorrow, anytime between 8 AM and noon. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying at least.

Agent: I'm sorry we couldn't get it working today, but our technician should be able to take care of this tomorrow. Thanks for choosing Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your patience.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
