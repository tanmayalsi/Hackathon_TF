Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, uh, my internet just went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back online. I've tried unplugging the router and everything, and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. First, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... (pause) ...it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 2341 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet went out about an hour ago. Have there been any storms in your area recently, or have there been any changes to your setup?

Customer: No, no storms or anything like that. It was just working fine this morning, and then around noon it just... stopped. The router's lights are all dark except for one red light on the power button.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. The red power light is actually normal, so that's good. Can you tell me—is your modem powered on? That's the separate device, usually a box that's different from your router.

Customer: Oh, um... let me check. (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's got a couple lights on it, but they're not lit up like they normally are. It's mostly dark.

Agent: Alright, so the modem's powered on but the lights aren't showing activity. Let's try a restart on that. Can you unplug the modem from the power source?

Customer: Yeah, doing that now. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Let's leave that unplugged for about 30 seconds while I look into your account here. (typing sounds) I'm just checking to see if there are any service interruptions in your area... (pause) ...and I'm not showing anything on my end. Okay, go ahead and plug the modem back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Plugging it back in... and... okay, it's back in. So now what? Should I wait for the lights to come back?

Agent: Yes, exactly. It should take about two to three minutes to fully boot up. While we're waiting, let me ask—do you have the coaxial cable that connects from the wall to the modem? Is that cable plugged in securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks like it's plugged in. It's been like that for months, so...

Agent: Okay, good. And that cable, it's screwed in pretty tightly?

Customer: I mean, it looks fine to me. I'm not really sure what you mean by—

Agent: It should feel snug when you touch it, you know? Not loose or wobbly. Just give it a gentle tug to make sure.

Customer: (pause) Oh. Okay, I'm checking it now. Hmm, actually, it does feel a little loose. Let me tighten it up. (pause) Yeah, I got it a bit tighter. Does that matter?

Agent: It could definitely matter, actually. Loose connections can cause connectivity issues. Now, are you seeing any lights coming back on the modem yet?

Customer: (pause) Um... a little bit. I see a light, but it's still mostly dark. It's like... half-lit? I don't know, it doesn't look right.

Agent: Okay, let's give it another minute or so to fully boot up. While we wait, is your router plugged in and turned on?

Customer: Yeah, it is. The power light's on, like I said.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Alright, let's check on that modem again. What are you seeing now?

Customer: Still pretty much the same. There's like one or two lights that are on, but the internet light or whatever it's supposed to be... it's not lighting up.

Agent: The internet light—that's usually labeled as "Online" or sometimes just "Internet." That's the key one. Let me try something else. Can you check the back of the modem and see if there are any other cables connected besides the coaxial?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, there's an ethernet cable going from the modem to the router.

Agent: Okay, that's correct. Can you unplug that ethernet cable for me real quick?

Customer: (pause) Done.

Agent: Now go back and plug it in. Make sure it clicks into place.

Customer: (pause) ...clicking it in now. (pause) Okay, it's in.

Agent: Great. Do you see that Internet light coming on now?

Customer: (long pause) ...No, I don't. It's still not lighting up. I've got maybe two green lights on the power side, but nothing on the internet side.

Agent: Hmm. (pause) Let me put you on a brief hold while I check something on the backend here. It'll just be one moment.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (hold music plays for about 20 seconds, then disconnects) Thank you for your patience. I'm back. Unfortunately, I'm not seeing a signal coming in from the street to your modem. That typically means the issue is with the line itself or at the pole.

Customer: Oh, so... what does that mean? Is my internet just broken?

Agent: Well, not necessarily broken, but it does mean the problem is on our end rather than with your equipment. Normally I'd schedule a technician to come out and check the line, but I want to try one more thing first.

Customer: Okay, what's that?

Agent: I'm going to remotely power cycle your modem from our system. Just bear with me for about a minute. (pause, typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I've initiated the restart. It should take a couple minutes.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, so... I'm just waiting?

Agent: Yep, just let it cycle through. Should see some activity pretty soon.

Customer: (pause) ...and...? Anything?

Agent: What are you seeing on your end now?

Customer: Same thing. One or two lights, but still no internet light.

Agent: Alright, unfortunately... (pause) I'm going to be honest with you—at this point, I'm fairly confident this is an external line issue. Without that signal coming into your modem, there's not much more we can troubleshoot remotely.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long is this going to take to fix?

Agent: I'd need to get a technician scheduled to come out and check the line. They can usually get out within the next couple of business days, depending on our availability. Let me see what I can get you. (typing sounds) How about Thursday afternoon? We have a window between 1 and 5 PM.

Customer: Thursday? That's like two days away. There's nothing sooner?

Agent: I wish I had something sooner, I really do. Let me check... (pause, typing sounds) Unfortunately, tomorrow's pretty booked. But I can put you on a cancellation list if something opens up, or we can go ahead and lock in Thursday.

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, okay. Go ahead and book Thursday. But I need internet before then. Is there anything else I can do?

Agent: I understand, and I'm sorry. In the meantime, if you have a mobile phone with data, that's really your best option. And just to be thorough, we did go through all the equipment steps. The technician will be able to check the physical line when they arrive.

Customer: Alright, fine. So Thursday between 1 and 5.

Agent: Yes, Thursday the 19th, between 1 and 5 PM. You should receive a confirmation email within the hour, and if the technician finds they need to reschedule, they'll give you a call. Is there a preferred contact number?

Customer: The number I called from is fine.

Agent: Perfect. I have that. And I do want to apologize again for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: (pause) No, I guess not. I'll just... I'll wait for Thursday.

Agent: Alright, thank you for your patience today, and again, I'm sorry we couldn't resolve this over the phone. You should be all set once our technician gets out there.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier. Have a good day.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
