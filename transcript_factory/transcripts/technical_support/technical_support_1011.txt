Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so my internet just went out completely. It's been down for like an hour now and I can't figure out what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account really quick here. Can I get your phone number or account number, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at the account for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, Robert, so you're experiencing a complete internet outage right now. Have you tried unplugging your modem and router yet?

Customer: Uh, I did that actually. I unplugged everything for like a minute and plugged it back in, but nothing happened. Still no lights, nothing.

Agent: Okay, okay. So when you plugged it back in, did you wait a full two minutes? Because sometimes it takes a bit for the modem to fully restart and establish a connection.

Customer: I... maybe not a full two minutes, no. I waited like thirty seconds and then I just gave up. But I'm looking at it now and... let me see... yeah, there's still no lights on the modem at all. Not even the power light.

Agent: Alright, that's actually really helpful information. The fact that there's no power light tells me it might be a power issue rather than a service issue. Can you check if the power cable is fully plugged into the modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks plugged in to me. It's definitely in the outlet.

Agent: Is the outlet working? Like, do you have anything else plugged into it you could test?

Customer: Good point. Let me... (background noise, shuffling) Okay, I'm plugging in a lamp right now and... yeah, the lamp is on. So the outlet is fine.

Agent: Good, so the outlet's working. Let me have you try something else. Can you unplug the power cable from the modem itself and wait about thirty seconds, then plug it back in? And this time let's wait a full two minutes and see if we get any lights.

Customer: Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Alright, I'm waiting. This is taking forever.

Agent: I know, I know. (typing sounds) While we're waiting, let me just verify a few things on our end. Can you tell me, did anything change with your setup recently? Any storms, power outages, anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The weather's been fine. Actually, now that you mention it though, we did have an electrician here yesterday doing some work in the house. But they weren't near the modem or anything.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Well, that could potentially be... it's probably not related, but you never know. Alright, it's been about two minutes now. Are we seeing any lights on the modem?

Customer: (pause) No. Nothing. Still completely dark.

Agent: Okay, let me try a different approach here. Can you check the power cable itself? Is it plugged into the modem all the way? Sometimes these connections can get a little loose.

Customer: Let me look. (rustling sounds) It looks pretty tight to me, but... (pause) Oh, wait. Actually, I think I might see... is there supposed to be a little pin on the power connection? It looks like something might be... I don't know, it might be bent or something inside the port.

Agent: Oh, that could definitely be it. The power connector does have some small pins in there. If one of those is bent, that would prevent power from getting to the modem. Have you tried wiggling the cable in there or adjusting it at all?

Customer: No, I don't want to break it further. That seems risky.

Agent: Fair enough, that's actually pretty smart. (pause) Okay, so here's what we're looking at. It sounds like there might be a physical hardware issue with your modem, possibly the power connection. Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to fix that over the phone.

Customer: So what does that mean? Do I need to buy a new one?

Agent: Well, let me check your account here. (typing sounds) You know what, we might be able to get you a replacement modem shipped out. Before we do that though, I do want to try one more thing. Do you have a different power cable? Maybe from another device? Just to rule out whether it's the cable itself?

Customer: Uh... (pause) I might have one. Let me look around. (background noise, drawers opening) Okay, I found one. It looks like it would fit. Let me try... (pause) Plugging it in now.

Agent: Great.

Customer: (long pause) Nope. Still nothing. This one doesn't work either.

Agent: Alright, so we've tried two different power cables. That's... that's pretty conclusive that it's the modem itself. I'm going to go ahead and get a replacement unit shipped out to you at no charge. It should arrive in about three to five business days.

Customer: Okay, but in the meantime, I have no internet. Is there any way you can expedite that or... I mean, I need internet for work.

Agent: I totally understand. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) (pause) Unfortunately, our fastest shipping option is still going to be three to five business days. I'm not able to expedite beyond that. However, what I can do is apply a credit to your account for the days you're without service.

Customer: Alright, I guess that's something. How much credit are we talking about?

Agent: (typing) I can give you a credit for five days of service, which would be... about twenty-two dollars. How does that sound?

Customer: I mean, it's not ideal, but... okay. Can you at least make sure the replacement modem arrives as soon as possible?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to mark this as expedited on our end, which won't change the shipping time but it will make sure it's prioritized. Is the address on file still correct?

Customer: Yeah, 447 Maple Street. That's correct.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And just to confirm, we're looking at a ship date of tomorrow, so you should be looking at receiving that by... Thursday or Friday at the latest.

Customer: Okay. And when I get it, I just plug it in and it should work?

Agent: Yeah, exactly. It's a pretty straightforward swap. Just unplug the old modem, plug in the new one, and you should be good to go. The connection should establish automatically. If you have any issues when it arrives, feel free to give us a call back and we'll walk through it.

Customer: Alright. I guess that's... that's all I can do then.

Agent: I know this is frustrating, Robert. I really am sorry about this. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just hope it arrives soon.

Agent: I completely understand. We've applied that credit to your account and your replacement modem is on the way. You should receive an email with a tracking number once it ships tomorrow. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. Bye.

Agent: Take care, Robert.
