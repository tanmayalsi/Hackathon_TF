Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet went out about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've got work I need to do and it's really frustrating.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we can get to the bottom of this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's, uh, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. Okay, so your service address is on Maple Drive, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, you're experiencing a complete outage? Your modem and router aren't showing any lights or connection at all?

Customer: Correct. Nothing. It's all dark. I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, but still nothing.

Agent: Okay, that's actually a good first step that you already tried. Let me just check on our end real quick... (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area at the moment. That's actually good news because it means this is likely something we can troubleshoot. 

Can you tell me what type of modem you have? It should say on the front or back of the device.

Customer: Um... it's a white box. Says... Arris? I think? Yeah, Arris SB8200.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. And your router—do you have a separate router or is it combined?

Customer: Separate. It's a Netgear, I think. Black one.

Agent: Okay, good. So here's what I'd like you to do. Can you go ahead and check the cable connection on the back of your modem? There should be a coaxial cable going into it from the wall. Can you just verify that it's connected securely?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it now. It seems... it looks connected to me, but let me try tightening it just to be sure.

Agent: Good idea.

Customer: (pause) Okay, tightened it. Still nothing though.

Agent: Alright, no worries. Is there a power cable connected to the modem as well?

Customer: Yes, it's plugged in. I can see the outlet and everything.

Agent: And when you plug it in, do you see any lights come on at all? Even for a second?

Customer: (pause) No. Nothing. It's completely dark. That's what's weird about it.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That does sound like it could be a power issue. Let me ask you this—are other things plugged into that same outlet working fine?

Customer: Oh, good question. Let me... (pause) Yeah, I have a lamp plugged in next to it and the lamp is working fine.

Agent: Okay, so power to the outlet is fine. Let me have you try something. Can you unplug the modem completely, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in? And then let me know if you see any lights at all.

Customer: Sure. (pause) Unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, waiting... (pause) And plugging it back in... (pause) [inaudible] ...still nothing. No lights.

Agent: Still nothing at all?

Customer: Nope. It's dead.

Agent: Okay. Unfortunately, that does sound like the modem might have a hardware failure. Before we go down that path though, let me just ask—did anything unusual happen before the internet went out? Like a power surge, or did you notice any burning smells or anything odd?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I was just working this morning, everything was fine, and then suddenly it just stopped.

Agent: Right, okay. Well, let me check something on our system here. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, so I'm going to run a quick diagnostic on your line and see if there's any signal coming through... (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm actually not getting any signal from your modem at all, which does confirm that there's likely an issue with the equipment itself.

Customer: So what does that mean? How long is this going to take to fix?

Agent: Well, so we have a couple options here. The most common issue would be that the modem needs to be replaced. I can definitely send you a replacement modem overnight, and typically you'd receive it tomorrow, and then you'd just swap it out.

Customer: Overnight? I need internet today though. Is there any way to...

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what else we can do here. (pause) (typing sounds) Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day replacement options available at the moment due to staffing, but the overnight should get you back up and running very quickly. Would that work for you?

Customer: I guess it has to. But I'm going to be without internet for the whole night. This is really not ideal.

Agent: I totally get it. Let me see if there's anything else we can try first before we go that route. Um, just to cover all our bases—is the coaxial cable that connects to your modem... do you see any visible damage on it? Any kinks or cuts?

Customer: (pause) Hmm, I'm looking... no, it looks fine. It looks normal.

Agent: Okay. And you don't have another modem in the house that we could try, do you?

Customer: No, I don't.

Agent: Alright. (pause) Let me try one more thing here. Can you try a different outlet? Just to be absolutely sure it's not a power issue?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Let me... (pause) I'm going to move it over to the kitchen. (pause) Okay, plugging it in... (pause) Nope. Still nothing.

Agent: Alright, well, unfortunately I think we've exhausted our troubleshooting options on my end. This really does appear to be a modem hardware failure. The good news is that I can get that replacement sent out to you right now for overnight delivery.

Customer: (sighing) Okay, fine. Yeah, go ahead and send the replacement.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to process that for you. Can I just verify the service address one more time? 247 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great. And the best number to reach you at when the modem arrives is the number on file, 555-0147?

Customer: Actually, I prefer you text me. Can I give you my cell number?

Agent: Of course, absolutely.

Customer: It's 555-0198.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got that down. Okay, so your replacement modem will be arriving tomorrow between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. You'll receive a text notification when it ships out, and another text when it's out for delivery. When it arrives, you'll just unbox it, plug in the power and the cable, and it should be up and running within a few minutes.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope, that should be all. The modem will come pre-configured, so you shouldn't need to do anything on your end besides connect the cables. Your service should automatically activate once it gets a signal.

Customer: Alright. Well, thanks for trying at least. I'm just frustrated about losing internet today.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm really sorry we couldn't get this resolved immediately. But you should be back online tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess not. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
