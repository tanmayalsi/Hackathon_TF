# Frontier Communications Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, uh, yeah. Hi Marcus. So my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I need to get it working pretty soon if I can.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, is this the account under James Mitchell?

Customer: That's right, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your internet's been down since this morning. Have there been any changes to your setup recently? Any new equipment or anything like that?

Customer: No, not really. Everything was working fine yesterday, and then I woke up this morning and... nothing. The router's not showing any lights or anything.

Agent: Okay, got it. So the router lights aren't coming on at all. Let's start with the basics. Can you check if the power cable is securely connected to the router? Sometimes it can come loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, hold on. (rustling sounds) Let me... okay, I'm looking at it now. It looks pretty plugged in, but let me make sure it's all the way in.

Agent: Sure, go ahead.

Customer: (rustling) Okay, I pushed it in a bit more but... no, the lights still aren't coming on.

Agent: Alright. And when you look at the power adapter itself, does the adapter light up? Is there a small LED on the power brick?

Customer: The power brick? Um... (pause) I'm not sure what you mean exactly. Is that like the... the box thing?

Agent: Yeah, exactly. The box that plugs into the wall outlet. Does it have any light on it?

Customer: Oh, okay. No, I don't see any light on it. It's just black.

Agent: Okay, so that tells me the power adapter might not be getting power. Can you try unplugging it and plugging it back in? Maybe use a different outlet if you have one nearby?

Customer: Sure, let me try that. (pause) I'm unplugging it... (pause) ...and I'm going to plug it into the outlet over here by the couch.

Agent: Good. Now let's wait a moment and see if anything lights up on the adapter or the router.

Customer: (pause) Uh... nothing yet. Still nothing. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand. These things can be annoying. Let me ask you this—do you remember if you had any power outages or storms in your area last night? Sometimes surge damage can affect the equipment.

Customer: Actually, yeah. Now that you mention it, there was some pretty heavy rain and a couple lightning strikes that I heard. Could that be it?

Agent: That could very well be it. Power surges can damage the equipment. Let me see if I can look at what's happening on our end with your modem. (typing sounds) I'm going to check the modem status for your account real quick.

Customer: Okay, yeah, please.

Agent: (pause) Hmm. Okay, so I'm showing that your modem is offline right now, which matches what you're seeing. The modem itself might not be communicating with our network at all.

Customer: So what does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: Well, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. I want to try a few more things. Do you have any other outlets you could try? Sometimes a particular outlet can be faulty. And maybe try a different power cable if you have one around?

Customer: (pause) I mean... I have a phone charger cord around here somewhere, but that's probably not the right one, right?

Agent: (pause) No, actually, you need to use the specific power adapter that came with the modem. Using the wrong adapter could cause more issues. But trying the different outlet is still worth a shot.

Customer: Okay, hold on. Let me see if there's another outlet nearby that might work better. (pause) There's one over here that seems to work pretty well. Let me unplug this and move it over there.

Agent: Sure, go ahead.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, I'm plugging it back in over here and... (pause) ...still nothing. The power adapter still doesn't have any light.

Agent: Alright. And I want to confirm—are you looking at an outlet that you know is working? Like, is something else plugged into that outlet that's currently on?

Customer: No, actually, now that you say that, I'm not sure if this outlet works. Nothing else is plugged in here.

Agent: That might be your issue. Can you plug it back into the original outlet and then try plugging something else—like a lamp or your phone charger—into that outlet to make sure it's working?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, good thinking. Let me try that. (rustling sounds) I'm plugging my phone charger in... okay, the phone charger light is on, so that outlet definitely works.

Agent: Great. So we know the outlet is working. That means the issue is likely with either the power adapter or the modem itself. Since the power adapter isn't showing any lights, I'm suspecting the surge might have damaged it.

Customer: So what do I do? Can you send me a new modem?

Agent: That's definitely something we can do. But before we go down that route, let me see if there's a technician available to come out to your place. Sometimes they can bring equipment and get you back online faster than waiting for mail delivery. Let me check what appointments we have available. (typing sounds) (pause)

Customer: Okay, how long would that take?

Agent: Let me see here... (pause) Looking at your area, I've got an opening tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 4 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's pretty soon, I guess. Yeah, I can do that.

Agent: Perfect. But I do want to mention, if it's just the modem and power adapter, I might be able to get you a replacement shipped out today, and you could have it by tomorrow as well. Let me call and check with our fulfillment center real quick to see what we can do. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (brief hold music plays) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I checked, and we can get a replacement modem and power adapter out to you, but the earliest it would arrive is the day after tomorrow. So your faster option would be to have a technician come tomorrow. 

Customer: Alright, yeah, let's do the technician then.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm getting you set up for that. Before I finish up, let me just make sure I have the right information. Your address is still 447 Maple Street, unit B?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And is the phone number on file still 555-0294?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell phone, so that's good.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, James, I've scheduled a technician visit for tomorrow, March 15th, between 2 and 4 PM. They'll be able to take a look at your modem and power adapter, and if they need to replace them, they'll bring new equipment. Is there anything else I can help you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I really hope they can get it fixed. I've got a lot of work to do from home, and I really need the internet.

Agent: I completely understand. The technician should be able to get you back up and running. They'll give you a call about 30 minutes before they arrive, so just keep an eye on your phone.

Customer: Got it. Thanks for your help, Marcus.

Agent: Of course. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and sorry you had this issue. We'll get you taken care of tomorrow. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
