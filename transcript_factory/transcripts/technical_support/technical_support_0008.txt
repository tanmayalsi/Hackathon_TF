Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet went down this morning and I've been without it all day. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. So you're completely without internet service at the moment?

Customer: Yeah, completely. Nothing. I've got the modem and the router and neither one is doing anything.

Agent: Alright, let me ask you a few quick questions. When did this start exactly?

Customer: Um, this morning around 7 or 8 AM. I went to check my email and just... nothing. The lights on the modem are off, I think. Or they're not blinking like they usually do.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. First thing I'd like to try is a quick power cycle. Can you unplug the modem for me? That's the device that usually has the Frontier branding on it.

Customer: Yeah, hold on. (background noise) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Let that sit for about 30 seconds while I'm here with you.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, how long now?

Agent: You can go ahead and plug it back in.

Customer: (background noise) Alright, it's plugged back in. Now what?

Agent: Just give it a minute to boot back up. You should see some lights come on—usually a power light, maybe a couple others. Let me know when you see that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I'm seeing some lights now. There's like a green one and it's blinking.

Agent: Perfect. That's normal. And do you see any lights that are red or orange?

Customer: Um... (pause) No, I don't think so. Just the green one blinking.

Agent: Good, good. Now let's check the router. Can you unplug that as well? The router is usually a separate device, a bit smaller usually, maybe has antennas on it.

Customer: Oh yeah, I see it. (background noise) Okay, unplugged.

Agent: Same thing—let that sit for about 30 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Alright, and... plug it back in?

Agent: Yep, go ahead.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, done. It's lighting up now too. So now I should have internet?

Agent: It should be coming up now. Can you try opening your web browser and going to a website? Maybe Google or something?

Customer: (pause, typing sounds) Um... no, still nothing. The page just keeps loading. It's not even timing out, it's just... stuck.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, let's try something else. Can you tell me what you're seeing on the modem right now? Like, which lights are on or blinking?

Customer: There's a power light that's solid green, and then there's like... I think it says "Internet" on it? And that one is blinking green too.

Agent: Okay, so the Internet light is blinking, which means it's trying to connect. Can you also check—is there any light on the modem that might be labeled "Online"?

Customer: (pause) I'm looking... I don't see one that says "Online" but there's one that's just... off. It's not lighting up at all. I think it might say something but I can't quite... (pause) I think it's the WAN port maybe?

Agent: The WAN port light being off is actually... hmm. Let me see here. (typing sounds) Just to cover our bases, can you check the cable? The one that goes from the modem to the wall outlet—is it fully plugged in? Sometimes these can get loose.

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, let me check. (pause) It looks pretty tight to me. I mean, I can try wiggling it... (brief pause) No, it seems secure.

Agent: Alright. I'm going to be honest with you—it sounds like there might be an issue on our end, possibly with the line coming into your house. The fact that the Internet light is blinking but not solid green suggests the modem isn't establishing a connection with our network.

Customer: Oh no. So what does that mean? How long is this going to take to fix?

Agent: Well, let me put in a trouble ticket for you. I can schedule a technician to come out and check the line at your house. They'll be able to see if there's an issue with the connection. (pause) The earliest I can get someone out there is tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Are you sure there's nothing else we can try right now?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me try one more thing. Can you do a factory reset on the modem? There's usually a small reset button on the back. You'll need something like a paperclip or a pin.

Customer: (pause) Let me find something. (background noise, rustling) Okay, I'm holding down the reset button... how long?

Agent: Just hold it for about 10 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing it. (longer pause) Done. Now what?

Agent: Now let's let it boot back up completely. This might take a few minutes.

Customer: (long pause) Okay... I'm waiting. (pause) Nothing's changed. The same lights as before.

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately I think we're looking at an external issue. The modem should be getting a stronger signal than what it's showing right now. I really think we need a technician to check the line.

Customer: (sighs) Alright. Yeah, schedule the technician. Tomorrow between 1 and 5?

Agent: That's correct. Let me just confirm your address to make sure they go to the right place. You're at 447 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And just to set expectations, the technician will check the line coming into your house, check the connection points, and if it turns out to be equipment, we can swap that out as well. The visit is complimentary since this is a service issue.

Customer: Okay, good. Is there anything I need to do in the meantime?

Agent: Just leave the modem and router plugged in so the technician can see them in their current state. And if by some chance your internet comes back on before they arrive, just give us a call to let us know so we can cancel the appointment.

Customer: Yeah, I'll do that. (pause) So I'm all set then?

Agent: You are. You should get a confirmation email shortly, and you can also check your account online for the appointment details. The technician will call before they arrive.

Customer: Alright, thanks I guess. I mean... I wish we could've fixed this today but I appreciate the help.

Agent: I'm really sorry we couldn't get you back online right now. We'll definitely get this resolved tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
