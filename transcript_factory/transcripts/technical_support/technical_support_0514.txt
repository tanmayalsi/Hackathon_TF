Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I can't figure out what's going on. I really need to get it back up and running.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. One moment... Alright, I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in... Riverside?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So your internet went down this morning. Have you tried restarting your modem yet?

Customer: Actually, yeah, I did that like an hour ago. Unplugged it, waited a few minutes, plugged it back in. Nothing.

Agent: Okay, good to know. And when you say it's down, what exactly are you seeing? Is there any light on the modem at all?

Customer: Um, yeah, so the power light is on, and I think... I see like a blue light, but it's not the solid light like it usually is. It's kind of flickering?

Agent: Okay, so the power is on but the internet light is flickering. That usually indicates it's not getting a good connection signal. Let me check our network in your area real quick. (pause) (typing sounds) Have you experienced any outages or issues before this?

Customer: No, not really. It's been working fine for like two years now.

Agent: That's good. Alright, I'm not seeing any active outages in your zip code right now, so let's try a few more things. Can you try unplugging the modem for about thirty seconds? Maybe a full thirty seconds this time?

Customer: Yeah, okay. (background noise of unplugging) Alright, it's unplugged.

Agent: Just let it sit for a bit. In the meantime, is your ONT—that's the box that connects to your house from outside—is that powered on? It might be in a closet or near your router.

Customer: Oh, um, let me... I think there's something in my hallway closet? (background noise) Yeah, there's like a white box with some lights on it.

Agent: Perfect, that's it. Can you check what lights are on? We're looking for a green light, ideally.

Customer: (pause) Um, I see... red and green lights. The green one is solid but the red one is on too, and I think it's also kind of blinking?

Agent: Okay, so red and blinking is not ideal. That usually means there's a connection issue between the ONT and our network. Did you happen to move anything recently? Unplug anything? Any recent storms?

Customer: No, nothing like that. And, uh, it was working fine yesterday, so...

Agent: Right, I understand. Okay, can you go ahead and plug the modem back in now?

Customer: (background noise) Okay, it's back in.

Agent: Give it about sixty seconds to boot up completely. While we wait, let me just pull up your account here. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I'm not seeing any billing issues or anything that would cause a service interruption on our end.

Customer: Okay...

Agent: Do you have a computer or phone you can try connecting to? Either through WiFi or with an ethernet cable?

Customer: Um, I've got my phone here. Let me see if... (pause) No, I'm not seeing the WiFi network at all. It's not showing up.

Agent: It's not showing up. Okay. And the modem should be fully booted now. Can you check those lights again on the modem?

Customer: Yeah, same thing. Power's on, blue light is still flickering, and I don't see... wait, is there supposed to be a light on the back?

Agent: There might be a couple other indicators on the back, but the main ones are on the front. The flickering blue light is the issue here. Let me try something. Can you locate the reset button on the modem? It's usually a small hole.

Customer: Oh, um... yeah, I see it. Should I press it?

Agent: Not yet. That would reset everything to factory settings and we'd have to go through the whole setup again. Let me check one more thing first. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at your modem here and it should have registered with our network this morning, but I'm not seeing a connection timestamp more recent than... yesterday at 11 PM.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It means the modem lost connection to our network sometime overnight or early this morning. Now, this could be a few different things. It could be the modem itself, the ONT, or potentially a line issue outside your house. (pause) I wish I had better news, but I think this might require a technician visit.

Customer: Are you serious? I need this working today. Can't we figure it out over the phone?

Agent: I totally understand. Um, let me try one more thing. Let's do a factory reset on that ONT in your closet. There should be a small reset button on that as well. But just to set expectations—if this doesn't work, we're likely looking at a hardware issue.

Customer: Alright, where's the button?

Agent: It's usually on the back or bottom. There might be a label that says "reset."

Customer: (background noise) I think I found it. Do I just press it?

Agent: Yeah, hold it for about ten seconds. You might see the lights flicker or turn off.

Customer: (background noise) Okay, holding it... (pause) ...Okay, everything went dark and now the lights are coming back. I see green... and the red light is still blinking.

Agent: Still blinking?

Customer: Yeah.

Agent: (sigh) Alright. Um, that's unfortunate. Okay, let's give it another minute to fully reboot, and then we'll check if your modem has re-established a connection.

Customer: (pause) It's been like a minute. Still the same. The WiFi network still isn't showing up on my phone.

Agent: Yeah, I'm not seeing an updated connection on my end either. [inaudible] I'm really sorry, but I think we've hit a wall with what we can do over the phone. The red light on the ONT typically indicates a signal issue coming into your house from our network line, or a problem with the ONT itself. And since resetting didn't help...

Customer: So what do I do?

Agent: We can schedule a technician to come out and diagnose the issue. They can check the external line, test the ONT and modem, and get everything working again. I can get you scheduled for tomorrow if that works?

Customer: Tomorrow? I mean... do you have anything sooner? Like today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) Unfortunately, today's pretty booked, but I can put you on a list for an emergency slot if something opens up. Otherwise, I can get you first thing tomorrow, between 8 AM and 12 PM?

Customer: [inaudible] ...Alright, fine. Tomorrow morning.

Agent: Perfect. Your confirmation number is 847-FNC-2019. Is this phone number the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Alright, our technician will arrive between 8 and noon tomorrow. We really do apologize for the inconvenience, and thank you for your patience working through this with us.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and again, sorry about your service today. We'll get you back online tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
