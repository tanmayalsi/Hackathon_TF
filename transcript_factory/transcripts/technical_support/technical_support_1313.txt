# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, my internet's been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I need to get this fixed pretty urgently if possible.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get a name please?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) Alright, I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan at that address. So your internet's completely down—is that correct? No connection at all?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. I tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in, I checked all the cables... nothing's working.

Agent: Okay, that's good that you already tried that. Let me ask you a few things. Can you look at your modem for me? It's the box usually near your router. What color lights are you seeing on the front of it?

Customer: Um... (pause) there's like, no lights at all, actually. It's completely dark.

Agent: Okay, so no lights on the modem at all. Is it plugged in?

Customer: Yeah, I checked that. It's definitely plugged into the outlet and everything.

Agent: Alright. And can you see the power cord? Is it fully connected to the back of the modem?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... yeah, it looks like it's connected pretty tight.

Agent: Try unplugging the power cord from the modem itself, not the wall outlet, just from the modem. Hold it for about thirty seconds.

Customer: Okay... (pause, some rustling sounds) ...alright, holding it.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and plug it back in now.

Customer: (more rustling) Done. (pause) Hmm, still nothing. The modem's still dark.

Agent: Okay, still no lights. Let me check your account real quick to see if there's any issues on our end. (typing sounds, pause) David, I'm not seeing any outages reported in your area. Can you tell me, is the modem you're looking at—do you know if it's a Frontier-provided modem?

Customer: I think so? I mean, I didn't buy it separately or anything. It came with the install when they set everything up.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. Okay, so here's what might be happening. There could be a power supply issue with the modem itself, or there might be something with the connection coming into your house. But before we go down that road, let me have you check one more thing. Can you look at where the coaxial cable—that's the thick cable—comes into your modem? Do you see one of those connected?

Customer: The thick cable? Yeah, I see it. It's connected.

Agent: Perfect. And can you try disconnecting it from the modem and plugging it back in, just to make sure it's seated properly?

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, unplugging it... plugging it back... yeah, it's in there pretty good.

Agent: Alright. Still no power lights on the modem at all?

Customer: (pause) Nope. Nothing.

Agent: Okay, I'm going to be honest with you, David. It sounds like the modem itself might be the issue. We can definitely arrange a technician to come out and replace it. But let me try one more thing first. Is there any chance you have access to a different power outlet? Maybe in a different room?

Customer: Um, yeah, I could try the living room outlet.

Agent: Great. Go ahead and try plugging the modem into a different outlet if you can, just to rule out a bad outlet.

Customer: (pause, sound of moving things) Okay, trying it now... (pause) Still nothing. No lights.

Agent: [inaudible] unfortunately at this point, I'm fairly confident the modem needs to be replaced. Let me get you scheduled with a technician. How does your schedule look for the next couple of days?

Customer: Well, I really need this working today if possible. Is there any way someone could come out today?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds, pause) Unfortunately, today's pretty booked up. But I can get someone out to you tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's... okay, I guess I don't have much choice. Yeah, tomorrow works.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, before the technician comes out, there's still absolutely no power on the modem?

Customer: Right, nothing. It's dead.

Agent: Alright. I'm scheduling you for tomorrow. But just in case, is there anything else I should know about your setup? Any recent storms or power fluctuations?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It just... stopped working overnight.

Agent: Okay. Well, unfortunately these things happen sometimes. The modem might have had a power supply failure. The technician will bring a replacement unit tomorrow, and they'll get you up and running. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes, and you can always call back if you need to reschedule.

Customer: Alright. Is there anything I should do between now and then?

Agent: Just keep trying the power connection if you want, but honestly, I think you're good just waiting for the tech. If by some chance the modem powers on before they arrive, give us a call back and we can get you sorted.

Customer: Okay, I will. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome, David. I do apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get you back online tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help with?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
