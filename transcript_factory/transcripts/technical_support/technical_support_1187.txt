Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, my internet just went out like an hour ago and I've tried everything I can think of to get it back up and it's just... nothing.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at that now. And just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're experiencing a complete outage—no internet connection at all right now?

Customer: Right, nothing. My phone's connected to my mobile data, so that's why I'm calling you. The Wi-Fi just... died.

Agent: Okay, understood. Before we dig in too deep, let me ask you a few quick questions. First, is your modem powered on? Do you see any lights on the front of it?

Customer: (pause) Let me look... Yeah, I can see it from here. Uh, there's a red light. Just one red light.

Agent: Okay, one red light. So normally you should be seeing... you know, a few lights. Green and maybe some blue. A solid red light typically means there's no connection to our network. Let's try a reset. Can you unplug the modem for me and count to about ten?

Customer: Sure, yeah. (sounds of movement) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great, just... take your time. Count to ten.

Customer: (pause) One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten. Okay, plugging it back in now.

Agent: Perfect. Let's give that about a minute or two to boot back up. So while that's doing its thing, have you experienced any outages in your area recently? Or did anything happen before the internet went out? Like a storm or anything?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It was working fine this morning. I was on a call with my daughter, and then I went to make some lunch and when I came back it was just gone. Weird.

Agent: Hmm, that does sound sudden. Okay, so the modem should be booted up by now. Are you seeing any different lights?

Customer: (pause) Let me check... No, it's still the same. Still just that red light.

Agent: All right. The red light is persisting. That's... that's telling us the modem isn't establishing a connection to our network. Let me check something on my end. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm not seeing any outages in your area currently, but let me look at your modem status here... (pause) Hmm.

Customer: What? What is it?

Agent: I'm actually not seeing your modem registering on our system at all right now. That's unusual. Okay, let me ask you this—do you have a battery backup unit plugged in as well, or just the modem?

Customer: Just the modem. Well, it's plugged into a power strip.

Agent: Okay, can you try plugging it directly into the wall outlet? Just to rule out any power strip issues.

Customer: (background noise of things shifting) Okay, give me a second... Yeah, I'm unplugging it from the strip. (pause) Plugging it in directly. (pause) Okay, it's in.

Agent: Good. Let's give that another minute to cycle through and see if we get a different response.

Customer: (pause) Still nothing. Same red light.

Agent: All right. I'm going to try something from this end. I'm going to restart your modem remotely. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm sending that command now. This should take about... two to three minutes.

Customer: Okay, um... how long have you been with Frontier?

Agent: (chuckles) That's... that's a good question. I've been here about four years. Not as long as some folks, but long enough to know my way around most issues.

Customer: Right, well, hopefully you can figure this out because I really need this working. I'm supposed to be working from home the rest of the week.

Agent: Yeah, I totally understand. That's definitely stressful. Okay, so the restart command should be completing here in just a moment. Are you still seeing that red light?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at it right now and... wait. Is it supposed to be blinking?

Agent: Yes, actually! Blinking means it's in the process of connecting. That's a good sign. Let's wait just a little bit longer. Should settle out in the next minute or so.

Customer: Okay, cool. (pause) Still blinking...

Agent: Yep, that's normal. Just hang tight...

Customer: (longer pause) Okay, so... it's been like a minute and it's still just blinking.

Agent: Hmm. Okay, that's... that's taking a little longer than usual. The blinking should resolve. Let me check the logs on the modem. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I'm looking at some error codes here that are... they're not typical. Let me try one more thing. I'm going to resend the provisioning signal to make sure the modem's got all the right information.

Customer: Is that bad? The error codes?

Agent: It's... not great, but it's not necessarily the worst-case scenario either. Could be a few different things. Could be a configuration issue, could be something with the line itself. Let's just see if this next step helps. (typing sounds) Sending that now.

Customer: (pause) Okay.

Agent: All right, let's give that about ninety seconds and then check in again.

Customer: (pause) How much longer do you think this is gonna take? Not to rush you or anything, I just...

Agent: I know, I know. This should be one of our last troubleshooting steps before we'd need to look at scheduling a technician to come out. So hopefully we get this sorted in the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay, that's... that makes sense.

Agent: (pause) All right, how are those lights looking now?

Customer: (pause) Still blinking. Hasn't changed.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Yeah, unfortunately it looks like that provisioning signal didn't resolve it. I'm seeing the modem is still throwing those same error codes. And at this point, I think what we're dealing with is likely either a hardware issue with the modem itself, or possibly a line-level problem on our end.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: Well, it means we've exhausted the basic troubleshooting on your end. What I'd recommend is we get a technician scheduled to come out to your location. They can check the line, verify the signal coming into your home, and if it's the modem, we can potentially replace it.

Customer: And how long would that take? For someone to come out?

Agent: Let me check the availability. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so our next available appointment would be... tomorrow between one and five PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I kind of need it working today.

Agent: I completely understand. And I wish I could get someone out there sooner. Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day appointments available. But I can put you down as a priority call, which means when the technician comes tomorrow, they'll be one of our first stops.

Customer: (sigh) Yeah, okay. I mean, I don't really have much of a choice, do I? Tomorrow one to five is fine.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. I'm going to put that under the phone number on file, and you should receive a confirmation text and email with the technician's contact information. They'll call you if they're running ahead or behind schedule.

Customer: Okay, sounds good.

Agent: I apologize again that we couldn't get this resolved over the phone today. But hopefully the technician will have you back up and running tomorrow.

Customer: Yeah, thanks for trying, I guess. I appreciate it.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: All right, well thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, sorry for the inconvenience. Have a good rest of your day.

Customer: Yeah, you too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
