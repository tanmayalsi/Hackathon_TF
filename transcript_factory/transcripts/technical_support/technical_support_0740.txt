Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not sure what's going on. I really need to get this fixed because I'm working from home today.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and we'll get you back online. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my home phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I found you. I'm seeing your account here. So your internet service went down this morning, you said?

Customer: Yeah, I woke up around 8 AM and it was already out. I waited like an hour thinking maybe it was just a temporary thing, but nothing changed.

Agent: Okay, and are you still not seeing any connection right now?

Customer: No, nothing. My router's got lights on it, but the internet light isn't... you know, it's not doing what it usually does.

Agent: That's helpful information. Let me ask you a few questions. Are you looking at your router right now?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it. It's right here in front of me.

Agent: Great. Can you tell me what color the lights are? Like, are they green, red, or amber?

Customer: (pause) Um, okay, so I've got a green light on the power, and then there's like an amber light next to it. And the rest are just... off, I guess?

Agent: Okay, that amber light is typically your internet indicator. So what we're going to try first is just doing a simple restart of your modem and router. Have you had a chance to try that yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. How do I do that?

Agent: It's real easy. Just unplug the power cable from the back of your modem—that's usually the bigger device—and then unplug your router if it's separate. Leave them unplugged for about 30 seconds.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, unplugging now.

Agent: Perfect. While those are powering down, let me just ask—have you experienced any outages in your area recently, or is this the first time this has happened?

Customer: First time. And my neighbor has Frontier too and I asked him earlier and his internet's working fine, so I don't think it's an outage or anything.

Agent: Good troubleshooting on your part. (pause) Okay, go ahead and plug those back in when you're ready.

Customer: (rustling) Okay, plugging them back in now. (pause) Alright, it's... it's booting back up, I think.

Agent: Great. Let's give it about a minute to fully start up. While we wait, can you walk me through what happened right before it went down? Was there a power outage, or anything like that?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I just... I don't know, I went to bed, everything was fine, and then this morning it was just dead.

Agent: (pause) Alright, and do you see any change in those lights now?

Customer: Um... still the same. Green power light, amber internet light. Everything else is dark.

Agent: Okay, that amber light is still the issue. Let me try something else. Can you check if there's a coax cable—that's a thicker cable, kind of silvery—connected to the back of your modem?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I see it. It's plugged in pretty tight.

Agent: Good. Can you try unplugging that coax cable from the modem and then plugging it back in? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: Sure. (rustling sounds) Okay, unplugging... and... (pause) ...plugging back in.

Agent: And how long has it been since the restart now?

Customer: Maybe two minutes now?

Agent: Okay, let's give it another minute. Sometimes it takes a bit. In the meantime, is there anything else unusual you noticed? Any clicking sounds from the modem, or anything weird like that?

Customer: No, it's just... quiet. It's doing nothing.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, let me check something here. I'm looking at your modem registration status... (pause) Hmm. Okay. Are you seeing any change in the lights yet?

Customer: No, man. Still the same thing. The internet light is still just... amber.

Agent: Okay, we might need to try a factory reset. Before we do that though, let me check something in our system. (pause) When's the last time you had any service issues or service work done at your location?

Customer: I don't... I don't think I've had any work done. I've had this internet for like three years without any problems.

Agent: That's great to hear. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing some information here that might be relevant. Let me try one more thing. Can you locate the small reset button on your modem? It's usually recessed, so you might need a pen or a paperclip.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think I see it. It's like, super tiny, right? On the back?

Agent: That's the one. Now, before you press it, I want to make sure you're ready, because this is going to completely reset your modem. You'll have to go through the setup process again.

Customer: Uh, okay. Do I need to do anything special?

Agent: You'll need to just press and hold it for about 10 seconds until the lights flash. Once you release it, just give it a couple minutes to reboot. Go ahead when you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Okay, pressing it... and... holding... (pause) I see the lights flashing now.

Agent: Perfect. That's what we want to see. Now just let it sit and reboot. This should take about two or three minutes.

Customer: (pause, background noise of the customer's computer keyboard clicking) Alright, I'm waiting. How long now?

Agent: We're probably... (pause) ...about a minute in. We'll give it another couple minutes. While we're waiting, do you have your Frontier account information handy? Once it reboots, we might need to do some additional setup.

Customer: Um, I've got my bill here somewhere... (rustling) Yeah, I found it.

Agent: [inaudible] just keep an eye on those lights. Let me know when you see—

Customer: —Hey, the lights are... they're doing something different. The power's still green, but the internet light is still amber and... actually, wait. It's still not... (pause) ...it's not changing.

Agent: Okay, it might just need a bit more time. What does the rest of the status look like?

Customer: I mean, I don't really know what I'm looking at, man. There's just... lights. The internet one is still amber.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, I've got to be honest with you—we've run through the basic troubleshooting steps and that amber light typically indicates an issue with the modem's ability to register with our network. At this point, I think we might be looking at a hardware issue with your modem.

Customer: So... what does that mean? Do I need a new modem?

Agent: It's possible. What I'd recommend is we get a technician out to your location to diagnose exactly what's happening. They can do a more comprehensive check of your line and your equipment. How does your schedule look? Are you available for a technician visit?

Customer: Um... I mean, I'm working from home today, so I kind of need this fixed ASAP. Can they come today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... (pause) I'm showing we have a service window available tomorrow between 2 PM and 5 PM. Is that something that could work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I... I really need this today. This is a work thing for me.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check if we have any same-day availability. (pause) Unfortunately, it looks like today's pretty booked up. But I can try to flag this as urgent and see if we can squeeze you in...

Customer: (sighs) No, I mean... tomorrow afternoon is probably fine. I can work from somewhere else today, I guess.

Agent: I appreciate your flexibility. Let me get you scheduled. The window is 2 PM to 5 PM tomorrow. You'll receive a confirmation call about an hour before the technician arrives. Do you have a contact number they can reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, it's the phone number on the account.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm the address one more time—you're at 447 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. The technician will be able to diagnose what's going on and either repair or replace your modem. In the meantime, I wish I had better news for you today. I know this is frustrating.

Customer: Yeah, it's definitely not ideal, but I appreciate you trying. So, tomorrow, 2 to 5 PM, someone will call me an hour before?

Agent: That's correct. Do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that's... no, I think that covers it.

Agent: Alright, well, I'm sorry we couldn't get this resolved today. You should be all set for tomorrow's appointment. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll get you back online as soon as possible.

Customer: Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a good day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
