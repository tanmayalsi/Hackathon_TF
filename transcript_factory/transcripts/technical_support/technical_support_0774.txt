Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so my internet's been down since this morning and I'm not really sure what's going on. I work from home and I really need to get this figured out.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing an outage. I definitely understand how frustrating that can be, especially when you're working from home. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now... Alright, I've got you here. I'm seeing an account for James Morrison at 412 Elm Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So just to confirm, your internet service is completely down right now?

Customer: Yeah, completely. I've got nothing. I tried unplugging the modem and router this morning but that didn't help.

Agent: Okay, that's a good first step that you already took. Let me ask you a few questions here. When you look at your modem—do you know what kind of modem you have? Is it one that we provided, or...?

Customer: Uh, I think it's the Frontier one. It's white and it's got a couple lights on the front. Some of them are blinking but I'm not sure what they're supposed to be doing.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. So the lights are blinking—that's actually normal for some of them. Can you tell me which lights are on and which ones are blinking? Specifically, are you seeing the internet light or the online light?

Customer: (pause) Um... there's a power light that's on, solid. And then there's a couple others that are blinking green and... I think one might be red? Or orange? It's hard to tell in the lighting here.

Agent: Alright, so if you're seeing a red or orange light, that could indicate a connection issue. Let me walk you through a few troubleshooting steps, okay? First, can you check the back of the modem and make sure all the cables are plugged in securely? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, let me... (rustling sounds) Alright, I'm looking at the back. There's the power cable, and then... is it the coax cable I should be checking?

Agent: Exactly, yes. The coax cable is the thick one, usually looks like it's got a metal connector on the end. Can you make sure that one's nice and tight? Sometimes just twisting it a little bit tighter can help.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, yeah, I'm... I'm tightening it. It did feel a little loose actually. Let me see if... (pause) Nope, still not working. The lights are still the same.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Let me try a different approach. I'm going to do a remote restart of your modem from my end here. That sometimes helps reset the connection. It's going to take about two to three minutes for the modem to fully boot back up, so just give me one second. (typing sounds)

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I've sent the restart command. So what you should see is the lights are going to flicker and then the modem's going to go dark for a moment. Just keep an eye on it and let me know when you see the internet light come back on and stay solid.

Customer: Okay, I'm watching it now. (pause) Yeah, so the power light went off... and now it's coming back. (pause) The lights are cycling through... (longer pause) Okay, they're settling down now, but I'm still... I'm not getting internet. Same thing. Red light, or orange, still blinking.

Agent: Hmm, alright. Let me check on my end and see if I'm showing any connection issues on the line. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any activity coming from your modem on our network, which tells me there might be a physical line issue or possibly a problem with the modem itself. 

Let me ask you—have there been any recent storms in your area or any construction work?

Customer: Um, no storms that I know of. There was... actually, come to think of it, there were some utility workers out on my street yesterday doing something with the telephone lines, but I don't think they were near my house.

Agent: Okay, that could potentially be related. Sometimes work on the utility lines can affect service. Let me try one more thing with you. Can you unplug the modem and wait about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in? But this time, let's make sure it's completely booted up before we assume anything's wrong.

Customer: (sighing) Yeah, sure. (rustling sounds) Unplugging it now. (pause) Okay, waiting... (pause) Alright, plugging it back in. (pause) And now we wait, I guess?

Agent: Yeah, exactly. Just give it a minute or two to fully restart.

Customer: (pause, longer pause) Okay, so it's all lit up again. The power's on, I've got the green lights blinking... (pause) Nope. Still no internet. I'm trying to load a website on my phone using WiFi and it's still not connecting.

Agent: Alright, I appreciate your patience here. Unfortunately, from what I'm seeing, this doesn't appear to be something we can resolve over the phone. It's likely either a line issue from outside, or there could be a problem with the modem hardware itself. What I'm going to do is get you scheduled with a technician who can come out and take a look at your line and your equipment. They'll be able to diagnose what's actually going on.

Customer: Okay... so how soon can they come out? I really need my internet working today if possible.

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at today's schedule. We have a technician who can come out... (pause) it looks like we have availability this afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: This afternoon? Yeah, I guess that could work. I mean, it's not ideal because I was supposed to have a meeting at 3, but... yeah, I'll make it work.

Agent: Great. I'm going to go ahead and schedule that for you. The technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive to confirm they're on their way. And just to let you know, the service call fee is $99 if this ends up being something on our end, but if it's an issue with your equipment, you might be responsible for modem replacement, which could be around $150, depending on what we find.

Customer: Wait, so I might have to pay for this? But I haven't done anything wrong. The internet just stopped working.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. We do charge for service calls if the issue is determined to be with the customer's equipment rather than our line or network. However, the technician will do a full diagnostic when they arrive, so they'll be able to tell you exactly what's going on and what your options are before you're charged for anything. Does that make sense?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess so. So I'm scheduled for today between 1 and 5?

Agent: That's correct. I have you down for this afternoon, and the technician will call you around 30 minutes before arrival. Is the phone number on your account still 555-0147?

Customer: That's my house phone, but I don't really use it much anymore. Can they call me on my cell instead? It's 555-0892.

Agent: Absolutely, let me update that in the system here. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got your cell phone number updated. They'll call you on 555-0892. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. I just hope they can get this fixed.

Agent: I understand. I know this is inconvenient, but our technician is really good and they'll get to the bottom of what's happening. I'm sorry we couldn't resolve it over the phone. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you this afternoon. Have a great day.

Customer: You too.
