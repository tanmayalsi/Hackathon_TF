Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, so my internet's been down since this morning and I really need to get it back up. I've got work stuff I need to do.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... um, 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And what's the best name to have on the account?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. Thank you. So you're saying your internet went down this morning? When exactly did you first notice it?

Customer: Um, around 7:30 or so. I tried turning off my router, waiting a few minutes, turning it back on, you know... nothing. The lights aren't even coming on.

Agent: Okay, so the router lights aren't illuminated at all. Got it. Let me ask you a few questions. Can you see the modem—that's the device that connects to the wall—is that powered on? It should have some lights on it too.

Customer: (pause) Oh, hold on. Let me look behind the TV here. Yeah, okay, I'm looking at it. The modem... it's got a couple lights. There's like a green one and... I think it might be amber or orange? It's blinking.

Agent: Alright, so you've got one green light and one that's amber or orange that's blinking. That's actually helpful information. Is there a power cable coming out of the modem?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I can see it plugged into the wall outlet.

Agent: Good. And when was the last time your internet was working normally?

Customer: Yesterday evening, I think? Everything was fine last night. I shut everything down before bed, and this morning when I turned it on, nothing. Just... dead.

Agent: Okay. Sometimes after a restart, the modem needs a minute to boot back up. Have you left it powered on for at least five or ten minutes this morning?

Customer: (pause) I... I don't think so, actually. I turned it back on right away. Should I wait longer?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Why don't we try this: unplug the power cable from the back of the modem, count to about thirty seconds, and then plug it back in. While we're waiting for it to come back up, I'm going to check if there are any service issues in your area. Can you do that for me now?

Customer: Sure, yeah. (pause) Unplugging it now. Okay, thirty seconds... (pause) ...and plugging it back in.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great. Now just give it a moment to boot up. You should start seeing those lights come back on. While we wait, let me check the system here. Can you tell me if you've noticed any outages or anything weird going on in your area lately?

Customer: No, nothing. Just today. I mean, the neighbors seem to have power and everything, so...

Agent: Alright. (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any widespread outages reported in your service area as of this morning. Um... what are you seeing on the modem now?

Customer: Okay, so the green light is back on, but that amber one is still blinking. It's been like, what, thirty seconds now?

Agent: Yeah, give it about another minute or so. When the internet connection is fully established, you should see that amber light either turn green or stop blinking altogether. Let me just confirm—you're looking at the modem, not the router, right?

Customer: Right, the modem. The thing plugged into the wall. Not the Wi-Fi box.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, go ahead and give it another minute. I'll be right here.

Customer: (pause) Alright. (pause) Okay, it's been a minute and... the light is still amber and blinking. Is that bad?

Agent: Well, that light blinking usually means it's trying to connect but can't establish a stable connection. Have you checked the cable that runs from your wall into the modem? Sometimes those can get loose or disconnected.

Customer: (pause) Let me look at that. Um... (pause) [inaudible] ...yeah, it looks plugged in. It's tight.

Agent: Okay, good. And you're not seeing any visible damage to the cable or anything?

Customer: No, I don't think so. Looks normal.

Agent: Alright. Let me pull up your account and see what's showing on the network side. (typing sounds) Hmm. (pause) Let me try a couple more things. Sometimes there's an issue with the signal coming to the modem. Let me have you do a factory reset. On the modem itself, there should be a small reset button—usually recessed, so you might need a paperclip or something thin.

Customer: A reset button? Um... okay, let me look. (pause) I don't see a button. Are you sure it's there?

Agent: It should be, yeah. Look for a small hole on the back or bottom of the modem. It might be labeled "Reset."

Customer: (pause) Oh, wait. I see it. There's a little hole on the back here. Is that it?

Agent: That's probably it. Okay, so here's what you're going to do: press and hold that button for about ten to fifteen seconds. This will reset the modem to factory settings, so be prepared that it's going to restart.

Customer: (pause) Holding it. (pause) Okay... let go. Should I wait again?

Agent: Yes, let it reboot. This will take a few minutes. While we're waiting, can I ask—have you had any recent storms or anything that might have affected your equipment?

Customer: No, not that I can remember. It's been pretty clear.

Agent: Okay. (pause) Just checking the account notes here. It looks like your service is active and paid up. Everything should be working on our end. Let me know when the modem finishes restarting. Look for those lights again.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, it's coming back up. The green light is on again... but that amber one is still blinking. This is frustrating.

Agent: I understand. Let me try one more thing. We might need to manually restart your service connection from my end. Let me do that real quick. (typing sounds) Give me one moment here... (pause) Okay, I've initiated a refresh on your connection. This should take about a minute or two to process. Why don't you give it two minutes and then tell me what you're seeing?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... nothing's changed. Still the same amber blinking light.

Agent: Alright. Okay, James, I'm seeing a couple of things here. That amber light that keeps blinking—it's indicating that the modem is unable to establish a stable connection to our network, but I'm not seeing any network issues on my end, and I've confirmed your account is active.

Customer: So what does that mean? What do I need to do?

Agent: Well, this could be a few different things. It could be a signal issue from our network to your home, it could be a defective modem, or there could be an issue with the line coming into your house. Unfortunately, I can't fully diagnose that over the phone. I think what we're going to need to do is send a technician out to your location to take a look at everything.

Customer: A technician? When can they come out?

Agent: Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I can schedule someone for... we have availability tomorrow afternoon, between 2 and 4 PM, or the day after that in the morning between 10 AM and noon. What works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon, I guess. Is there any chance you could come out today?

Agent: Unfortunately, we don't have any same-day availability right now, but tomorrow should work. Let me get that set up for you. And just to confirm, is 555-0147... that's the best number to reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, James, I've got you down for tomorrow between 2 and 4 PM. A technician will come out and take a look at your equipment and your line. They'll bring any necessary replacement equipment if needed. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I guess that's it. I'll just have to wait until tomorrow. This is pretty inconvenient, but...

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. We really do apologize for the inconvenience. If you do see the connection come back before the technician arrives, feel free to give us a call back, and we can cancel that appointment. Otherwise, we'll see you tomorrow. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: Alright, thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a good day, James.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
