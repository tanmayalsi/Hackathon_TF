# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I have no idea what's going on. I really need to get this fixed.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing an account here under the name... David Martinez. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, David. So you're experiencing a complete internet outage since this morning. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, completely down. I tried unplugging the modem and router this morning, let them sit for like thirty seconds, and plugged them back in, but nothing. Still no internet.

Agent: Okay, good thinking on that. Um, let me ask you a few questions. When you plug in your modem, do you see any lights on it at all?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, actually. There's a light that's... it's like a steady red light on the front. Is that bad?

Agent: Okay, so a solid red light typically means there's no signal being received. That's helpful information. And your modem—do you know what model you have? It should say on the front or back.

Customer: Uh... (pause) it says... Frontier... and then it's like an MB8600 or MB8000? I can't quite read it.

Agent: No problem. That's helpful enough. Alright, so let me walk you through a few things we can try. First, I want you to locate the power cable going into your modem, okay?

Customer: Okay, I'm looking at it right now.

Agent: Great. I'm going to have you unplug it, but this time let's leave it unplugged for a full minute. This will do a hard reset.

Customer: Alright... (pause) ...it's unplugged.

Agent: Perfect. While we're waiting, let me just ask—have you experienced any outages in your area recently that you're aware of? Or any recent storms?

Customer: No, nothing like that. It's been fine all week until this morning. And I didn't change anything with my setup or anything.

Agent: Okay, that's good to know. (pause) Alright, it's been about a minute. Go ahead and plug the modem back in for me.

Customer: (pause) Okay... plugging it in now. (pause) So now I just... wait?

Agent: Yeah, just wait about two to three minutes for it to fully boot up. While that's happening, can you tell me—is your router a separate device or is it all in one?

Customer: No, it's separate. I have like a white box that's the router.

Agent: Okay, good. Once the modem fully boots up and the lights stabilize, we'll do the same thing with the router. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, sounds good. (pause) Um... I'm still seeing the red light though.

Agent: (pause) You're still seeing red? Okay, and how long has it been since you plugged it in?

Customer: Maybe... two minutes?

Agent: Alright, let's give it just a bit longer. Sometimes these can take up to three or four minutes. (pause) While we're waiting, David, have you had any recent billing issues or anything like that with your account? Sometimes that can affect service.

Customer: No, I don't think so. I pay my bill on time every month.

Agent: Perfect, and I'm not seeing anything flagged on my end either, so that's good. (pause) Okay, how's that light looking now?

Customer: Still... red. Yeah, it's still red.

Agent: Hmm, that's unusual. Okay, um, let me try a different approach. I'm going to check if there are any outages reported in your area. Can you give me your service address?

Customer: It's 422 Westbrook Drive, apartment 3B, in Henderson.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, checking that now... Alright, I'm not seeing any active outages in that area. The system shows your service should be active. (pause) Let me ask you this—are you in an apartment complex?

Customer: Yeah, I am.

Agent: Okay. Is it possible that an external line or connection point could have been disturbed? Like, have you noticed any maintenance work happening in your building?

Customer: No, I haven't seen anything. But I mean, I work nights, so I'm not here most of the day.

Agent: (pause) That's good context. Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. That red light on the modem is telling me that it's not detecting a signal from our network. That could be a few things—it could be an issue with the line coming into your apartment, or it could be an issue on our end that we need to investigate further.

Customer: Okay, so... what do we do?

Agent: Well, let me try one more thing with you first. Can you go ahead and unplug the router as well? The white box?

Customer: Sure, one sec. (pause) Okay, it's unplugged.

Agent: Good. Now leave that unplugged for now, and let's focus on just the modem. I want to make sure we get that working first. (pause) David, do you see any cables running from the modem to like a wall outlet or something?

Customer: Yeah, there's a cable that goes from the modem into the wall. Like, it's a coaxial cable, I think you called it last time I had an issue.

Agent: Perfect, yeah, that's the coaxial cable. That's the one bringing the signal in. Can you check if that cable is... [inaudible] ...sorry, can you check if that cable is snug? Like, twist it slightly to the right.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay... it's pretty tight already. (pause) Wait, actually, I think I felt it tighten a bit. Let me just... (pause) There. Is that going to help?

Agent: That was worth a try. Go ahead and wait about thirty seconds and see if the light changes.

Customer: (pause) Okay... (pause) Nothing yet. Still red. (pause) This is really frustrating.

Agent: I understand, David, and I really appreciate your patience here. (pause) Okay, so at this point, I think what we're looking at is likely an issue on the line itself, or it could be something at the network level that I can't troubleshoot from here. I want to get a technician out to you to physically check the line and your equipment.

Customer: How long would that take? Do I have to take time off work?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me check what appointments we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) So, I'm seeing we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could do Thursday evening between 4 and 8 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Um... I mean, I can probably do Thursday evening. I'm sleeping during the day anyway since I work nights.

Agent: Perfect, Thursday evening it is. So that's this Thursday, the... (pause) ...the 21st. We'll have someone out there between 4 and 8 PM. The technician will contact you about thirty minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that works. Is there anything else I can try in the meantime? Like, I'm without internet for two days.

Agent: I completely understand how inconvenient that is. Um, unfortunately, without that signal coming in, there isn't much else we can try on your end. I don't want to have you keep troubleshooting if the issue is external. Your best bet is to use mobile data if you have it, or maybe a library or coffee shop nearby?

Customer: Yeah, I've got data on my phone. It's just... annoying.

Agent: I know, and I'm really sorry. Let me make a note on your account that you're without service and we'll make sure the technician prioritizes this. And just so you know, if this ends up being a line issue on our end, we may be able to credit your account for the days you were without service.

Customer: Oh, okay. That's... that's something at least.

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. So I'm going to confirm: we have you down for Thursday the 21st between 4 and 8 PM. Your service address is 422 Westbrook Drive, apartment 3B. Is that all correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'll just... wait for the technician on Thursday.

Agent: Alright, David. Thank you for being so patient with me, and I apologize we couldn't get this resolved today. The technician will take good care of you on Thursday. You have a great rest of your day, okay?

Customer: Thanks. You too.

Agent: Thanks for calling Frontier. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
