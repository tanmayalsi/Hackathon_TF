Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So, um, my internet went down about an hour ago and I can't get it back up. I've tried unplugging the modem and everything, and nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. First, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account here. And your name is...?

Customer: James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. Thanks for that. So you mentioned the internet went down about an hour ago. And you've already tried restarting the modem?

Customer: Yeah, I unplugged it, waited like a minute, and plugged it back in. The lights came back on and everything, but I still can't connect to anything.

Agent: Alright, that's a good first step. Let me check a few things on my end. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area, which is good news. Can you tell me... when you say the lights came back on, what colors are they? Are they all solid, or is anything blinking?

Customer: Um... (pause) There's like a blue one and a green one that are solid, but there's... I think a white one that keeps blinking? Or is that normal?

Agent: Okay, the blinking light typically means it's trying to establish a connection. That's actually... well, it's kind of in between normal and not normal, if that makes sense. Can you tell me, are you able to see your WiFi network when you look at your available networks on your phone or computer?

Customer: Let me check. (pause) No, nothing. It's not even showing up.

Agent: Got it. Okay, no WiFi network visible. That tells me the modem might not be fully booting up. Let me have you try something. Can you unplug the modem again, and this time wait for about three minutes before you plug it back in?

Customer: Three minutes? That's longer than before.

Agent: Yeah, I know it seems like a long time, but sometimes it needs that full restart cycle to reset properly. While you're doing that, I'm also going to check if there's anything on our end that might be causing this.

Customer: Okay, unplugging it now. (pause) Yeah, it's unplugged.

Agent: Great. Just... go ahead and wait those three minutes. I'll be right here.

Customer: (pause) Alright, it's been a couple minutes. I'm just... I'm checking my email on my phone to kill time.

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, that's smart. We're almost there. Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: Okay, plugging it in now. (pause) Alright, the lights are... they're coming back on. There's that blue light again, and the green, and... yeah, the white one's blinking again.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and do you see the WiFi network now?

Customer: (pause) No, still nothing. This is... this is weird.

Agent: Alright, let me try something else. Can you look at the back of the modem and tell me if there's a cable connected to the wall? Like, is there a coaxial cable going in?

Customer: Yeah, there's like a thick cable, a silver one going into the modem.

Agent: Okay, good. Can you check if that's firmly connected? Sometimes these can work themselves loose.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, it looks pretty tight to me. I mean... (pause) wait, let me try wiggling it a little bit. Oh! Oh, wait—do you see anything on your end? Because I think something just... (pause) No, never mind. Still no WiFi.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm still showing that connection as down on your modem. James, I'm wondering if... is this a new modem, or have you had it for a while?

Customer: Oh, I don't know, probably a couple years? Maybe three? It's the one you guys sent when I first signed up.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful info. You know, it's possible the modem itself might be failing. Before we go down that road though, let me try one more thing. I'm going to send a reset signal to your modem from here. This might take a minute or two to process. Just keep an eye on those lights, and let me know if anything changes.

Customer: Alright, watching them now.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, the signal's being sent. How are those lights looking?

Customer: (pause) Same as before. Blue, green, and the white one blinking. Nothing's changed.

Agent: (pause) Okay... (pause) Alright, James, I've got to be honest with you. I'm not seeing a good connection on my end, and the modem doesn't seem to be responding to the reset signals I'm sending. At this point, I think we need to look at potentially replacing the modem.

Customer: Really? I mean... how long is that going to take? I really need my internet. I work from home and I've got... I've got a call later today.

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately, I don't want to waste your time with more troubleshooting if the modem is the issue. Let me see what we can do. (typing sounds) Okay, so I can actually set you up for a modem replacement. We can get one shipped out to you, but it typically takes about 5 to 7 business days.

Customer: Five to seven days? That's... that's going to be a problem. Isn't there anything faster?

Agent: Let me check. (pause) (typing sounds) We do have some locations where you can pick up a replacement modem in person, but I'd have to check if we have one in your area. Can you tell me your zip code?

Customer: It's 92104.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see... (pause) Unfortunately, our closest service center is about 30 minutes from you, and they don't have any in-stock modems available right now. They're expecting shipments later in the week, but I can't guarantee a specific day.

Customer: Man, okay. So I'm just without internet for almost a week then?

Agent: I know this isn't ideal, James. I'm really sorry. Is there... do you happen to have a mobile hotspot or anything you could use in the meantime?

Customer: I've got limited data on my phone, so I could probably... I could probably do that for email, but not for my work meetings. This is frustrating.

Agent: [inaudible] I totally understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me at least expedite the shipping on this modem for you at no extra charge, and I'm going to put a note on your account. When you call back once the modem arrives, just reference this call, and we'll make sure you get any courtesy we can offer.

Customer: Alright, well... I guess that's something. So what do I need to do? How do I place the order or whatever?

Agent: Great question. Actually, I can process that right now for you. I'm going to need to verify a couple of things first, though. Let me confirm your service address.

Customer: It's 412 Maple Street, San Diego.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 412 Maple Street, San Diego. Got it. And I'm going to have the modem shipped to that address. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, I've got the replacement order submitted. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with tracking information. The new modem should arrive by... let me see... probably around Wednesday or Thursday of next week.

Customer: Okay, so Wednesday or Thursday. Got it.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today, James?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I mean, hopefully this modem works when it gets here. I'm just... I'm frustrated, but I appreciate you trying to help.

Agent: I completely understand. And again, I'm sorry we weren't able to get you back online today. But I'm confident once you get that new modem, everything will be working perfectly. If you have any issues when it arrives or if you need any help setting it up, please don't hesitate to call back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
