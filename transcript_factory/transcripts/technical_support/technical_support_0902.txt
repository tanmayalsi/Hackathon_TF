# Frontier Communications Customer Support Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, uh, yeah. Hi Derek. So my internet just went out completely. Like, I was working from home and everything just... stopped. And I've been without connection for like twenty minutes now.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be, especially when you're trying to work. Let me help you get back online. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) hold on, let me find it. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm pulling up your account here. And your name?

Customer: It's James. James Peterson.

Agent: Thanks, James. So you're experiencing a complete service outage—no internet connection at all right now?

Customer: Yeah, nothing. And I tried unplugging the modem and the router, you know, the whole restart thing, but that didn't help.

Agent: Okay, that's actually a good first step that you already tried. Let me check a few things on my end here. (pause) Alright, I'm showing that your service is active and I'm not seeing any outages in your area currently. So let's dig into this a bit more. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Like, is the modem powered on?

Customer: Yeah, the modem's on. It's got the lights on it and everything. The router's on too. It's just... I'm not connecting to anything.

Agent: Okay. And when you look at the modem, are all the lights, um... like, what color are they? Are they green?

Customer: Uh, some of them are green. There's like a... wait, let me look closer. There's one that's like, orange? Or yellow? It's like blinking.

Agent: Okay, that could be something. Which light is that? Is it near the internet symbol or...?

Customer: It's, uh... (pause) it's kind of hard to tell actually. Everything's kind of clustered together on this thing.

Agent: I totally understand. So what I'd like to do is have you unplug the modem completely. Just for like thirty seconds. And while you're doing that, can you also check if there are any cables that look loose or disconnected? Especially the ones going into the back of the modem.

Customer: (pause) Okay, unplugging now. (pause) Yeah, I'm looking at the cables. They all seem pretty tight. They look fine to me.

Agent: Good. Let's wait another fifteen seconds or so, and then plug it back in. (pause) Go ahead and plug it back in whenever you're ready.

Customer: (pause) Okay, plugged in. We're waiting for it to boot back up, right?

Agent: Yeah, exactly. This usually takes about a minute or two. Just give it a minute and see if those lights stabilize.

Customer: (pause, background noise) Okay, lights are... they're doing something. Let me, um... let me try to connect to the WiFi on my phone to see if that works. (pause) Nope. Still nothing. The WiFi's not even showing up on my phone.

Agent: Hmm, okay. That's interesting. So the WiFi network itself isn't broadcasting?

Customer: That's correct, yeah.

Agent: Alright. Let me check something. Do you have a computer or device you can plug directly into the modem with an ethernet cable? Just to rule out the WiFi component?

Customer: Uh... yeah, I have a laptop. But I don't think I have an ethernet cable handy. I could probably find one, but it might take me a minute.

Agent: That would be really helpful if you could find one. It'll help us figure out if this is a WiFi issue or an internet connection issue.

Customer: (pause, sounds of moving around, drawers opening) Okay, I'm... I'm looking. (pause) Alright, I found one. Let me plug this in.

Agent: Perfect. (pause)

Customer: (pause, more rustling) Okay, it's plugged in. Now what?

Agent: Now open a web browser and try to go to a website. Like Google or something.

Customer: (pause, typing) Okay... (pause) No. Still nothing. It's like, it's not finding anything.

Agent: Okay, so no internet connection at all, even when hardwired. That's helpful to know. Um, let me check a couple more things on my end. (typing sounds) I'm looking at your modem status here. (pause) Alright, so I'm seeing that your modem is registered on our network, but I'm not seeing a downstream connection established. That means the modem isn't properly syncing with our network equipment.

Customer: (pause) Okay... what does that mean? Is that... is that something I can fix?

Agent: It could be. The most common cause is something wrong with the cables. Did you check the coaxial cable? That's the thicker cable, usually has a...

Customer: The thick one? Yeah, I see it. It's coming from the wall.

Agent: Right. Can you unscrew that and then screw it back on? Sometimes they can get a little loose.

Customer: (pause) Okay, trying that. (pause) It seems pretty... oh wait, actually, it did turn a little bit. Let me tighten it down.

Agent: Good call.

Customer: (pause) Okay, tightened. Let me... let me wait a second and see if the lights change on the modem. (pause) Um, nope. Still the same.

Agent: Still the same. Alright. (pause) James, I've got to be honest with you—this is a bit unusual. Normally when we see this issue, it's the coaxial cable. I want to check something with our network team. I'm gonna put you on a brief hold while I look into this a little deeper, okay?

Customer: Sure, okay.

Agent: Just one moment. (hold music plays briefly)

Agent: Okay, James, I'm back. So I've reviewed everything, and it's looking like there might be an issue on our end with your line coming into the house. I've got a couple options here. We can schedule a technician to come out and check your installation, or...

Customer: How soon can they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) I'm showing... the earliest I have available is tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 6 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? I really need my internet today. I've got meetings and... can't they come sooner than that?

Agent: I wish I could get someone out there sooner, but that's really the earliest availability we have. I know that's frustrating. (pause) What I can do in the meantime is apply a service credit to your account for today's outage, and I can make a note that this is urgent so the technician prioritizes you.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, I guess that's... I mean, it's not ideal, but... yeah, fine. Tomorrow afternoon.

Agent: Alright. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I've got a technician appointment scheduled for tomorrow, May 3rd, between 2 and 6 PM. You should receive a confirmation call from the tech about thirty minutes before they arrive. And I'm putting a note on here that you're working from home and this is a priority.

Customer: Yeah, thank you. I appreciate that. So there's nothing else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: (pause) Um, well... if you want to, you could try power cycling everything one more time—modem, router, unplug them for a full minute. Sometimes that helps. But honestly, based on what we're seeing, this is most likely going to need a technician to physically inspect the line.

Customer: Okay. So I'll just... I'll just sit tight until tomorrow then.

Agent: Yeah, I'd say that's your best bet at this point. And I did apply a $15 service credit to your account for today, so you should see that reflected on your next bill. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. Thanks for trying, Derek.

Agent: Of course, James. I'm sorry we couldn't get you back online today. We'll get this sorted out tomorrow. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and have a good rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
