# Frontier Communications Support Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications customer support. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, my internet has been down since this morning and I can't get it back online. I've tried restarting the router a couple times but nothing's working.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I know how frustrating that can be. Let me help you get this sorted out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up here... and I'm showing that's under the name... Robert Chen?

Customer: That's right, yeah.

Agent: Great, Robert. Thanks for verifying that. So you mentioned you've restarted the router already—that's good. Can you tell me what you're seeing right now? Like, is the router powered on? Are there any lights on it?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's powered on. I see the power light is green, but like... I think the internet light—it might be red? Or maybe orange? I'm not entirely sure. The whole thing's kind of confusing, to be honest.

Agent: No worries, that's actually really helpful information. The light you're describing—is it solid or blinking?

Customer: It's solid. It's definitely solid, not blinking.

Agent: Okay, a solid red or orange light typically means there's no connection coming from the modem. Do you have a separate modem from your router, or is it a combo unit?

Customer: I... I think it's a combo? It's just the one box that Frontier sent me.

Agent: Perfect, that makes sense. So what I'd like you to do is—let's try unplugging that device completely. Just pull the power cable out and wait about 30 seconds, then plug it back in. That'll do a full restart and sometimes that clears things up.

Customer: Okay, I'm doing that now. (pause) It's unplugged.

Agent: Great, just let it sit for about 30 seconds.

Customer: (pause) Okay... counting down... (longer pause) Alright, I'm plugging it back in.

Agent: Perfect. And now we're going to wait for it to boot back up. That usually takes about a minute or two. While that's happening, can you tell me—have you had any storms in your area recently? Or any power outages?

Customer: Oh, actually, yeah. There was a pretty bad storm last night. I didn't think about that until you mentioned it. The power went out for maybe twenty minutes or so around midnight.

Agent: Ah, that could definitely be related. Sometimes power surges can affect the equipment. Okay, so it should be coming back online now. Are you seeing any change in the lights?

Customer: (pause) Um, the power light is still green, but that other light... it's still not... I mean, it doesn't look different. Still looks orange or red.

Agent: Still not lit up green?

Customer: Right, still not green.

Agent: Alright, let's try a different approach. I'm going to check our systems to see if there are any outages in your area. Can you give me your service address?

Customer: Yeah, it's 1247 Maple Street, Apartment 3B. That's in Columbus.

Agent: (typing sounds) 1247 Maple Street, Apartment 3B, Columbus. (pause) Let me just... okay... I'm not seeing any reported outages in your area right now. The network looks good on our end. 

Customer: So the problem's with my equipment then?

Agent: It could be, yeah. Let me have you try one more thing before we look at that option. Can you check if there's a cable running from the wall into the modem? Like, where it connects to the building?

Customer: Oh, hold on. (pause) Yeah, I see it. There's like a coaxial cable, I think? It's the thick one?

Agent: That's the one, yeah. Can you just wiggle it a little bit where it connects to the modem? Just make sure it's tight?

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm doing that... it felt like maybe it wasn't fully in? I'm pushing it in more now.

Agent: Good, good. Let me know if anything changes.

Customer: (pause) Hmm... nope. Still the same. Still red or orange or... whatever.

Agent: Okay, still no change. (pause) Robert, let me try checking something on my end. Can you look at the back of the modem where that cable comes in? Is there any visible damage to the port or the cable itself?

Customer: (pause) I mean, not that I can see? It looks... normal? Both the cable and the port look fine to me.

Agent: Alright. And just to double-check—your computer or phone that you're using right now, that's not connected to the internet at all? Like, you can't see any WiFi networks?

Customer: [inaudible] ...the WiFi network isn't showing up. I checked my phone too, and nothing.

Agent: Yeah, that confirms what we're seeing. The modem's not broadcasting a signal at all. (pause) Robert, I wish I had better news, but based on what we've troubleshot here, it sounds like there might be an issue with the modem itself—possibly from that power surge you mentioned from the storm last night. Sometimes that equipment just doesn't recover from that kind of event.

Customer: So what does that mean? I need to buy a new one?

Agent: Well, here's the thing—if the damage is from a power surge that came from outside, that might actually be covered under our equipment protection. And even if it's not, we can send you a replacement modem at no charge. But I do need to escalate this to a technician who can actually get eyes on your situation and maybe do some further diagnostics.

Customer: Okay, so I need to schedule someone to come out?

Agent: Let me see what we can do. (typing sounds) The soonest we have a technician available is... it looks like Friday between 2 and 4 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: This week? It's only Tuesday. I don't have internet for four days?

Agent: I understand the frustration. Unfortunately, Friday is our next available appointment in your area. If this is an emergency situation, I can note it as urgent and—

Customer: No, no, I guess Friday is fine. It's not ideal, but okay.

Agent: Alright, I have you down for Friday from 2 to 4 PM. The technician will either repair or replace your modem at that time. And Robert, if you do manage to get it working before then, just give us a call back and we can cancel that appointment.

Customer: Will do. Is there anything else I can try in the meantime?

Agent: (pause) You know what, I don't think so. At this point, I think we'd just be spinning our wheels. The technician will take it from here on Friday. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for trying anyway.

Agent: No problem at all, Robert. We appreciate your patience and we'll get you back online as soon as we can. You should receive a confirmation email within a few minutes with your appointment details. Is that email address still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's still good.

Agent: Perfect. Have a good rest of your day, and we'll see you Friday.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
