Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Marcus. So, I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm pretty happy with the service, but I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I appreciate that, and I'm glad to hear you've been satisfied with us. I'd be happy to help you explore upgrade options. (typing sounds) Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 503-555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Perfect, got it. So, I'm seeing you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've got it, like, pretty much maxed out these days. I'm working from home a lot more now, and my wife streams constantly, and... I don't know, pages are just loading slower than they used to.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. With multiple users and streaming, 100 Mbps can definitely get congested. What kind of speeds are you thinking about upgrading to? We've got some really great options available in your area.

Customer: Um... I'm not really sure. What do you have?

Agent: Excellent question. So, in your area, we offer several tiers. You could go with our Fiber 300 plan, which gives you 300 Mbps download speeds for about... let me see here... (typing sounds) that would be $79.99 per month for the first 12 months. After that, it goes to $99.99.

Customer: Oh, wow. That's... that's quite a bit more than what I'm paying now.

Agent: I understand. What are you currently paying, if you don't mind me asking?

Customer: I think it's around $60 a month, maybe $65?

Agent: (pause) Let me just confirm that. (typing sounds) Okay, so you're actually at $69.99 per month right now. So the upgrade to Fiber 300 would be about $10 more for the first year, and then $30 more after that. But I will say, with the increased speed, you're going to notice a massive difference in performance.

Customer: Right, okay. Um... what about something in between? Do you have like a 150 or something?

Agent: That's a great question. We actually just discontinued our Fiber 150 plan in your area, unfortunately. But we do have Fiber 200. That gives you 200 Mbps, and that's $69.99 per month for the first year, then $89.99 after.

Customer: Hmm, wait, so that's the same price as the 300?

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Oh, I apologize. I misspoke there. The 300 is $79.99 for the first year. So the 200 would actually be $69.99, which is... well, it's actually $10 less. That might be a good middle ground for you.

Customer: Okay, so if I go with the 200... like, is there any promotion or anything? Any way to get a better deal?

Agent: That's a fair question. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) (pause) You know what, because you've been such a loyal customer for three years, I can actually apply a loyalty discount. I can get you the Fiber 200 plan at $64.99 per month for the first 12 months instead of $69.99. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh, that's... that's actually really good. That's basically what I'm paying now, right?

Agent: Exactly. And you'd be getting double the speed. That's a solid deal.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I think I want to do that. Do I need to do anything with my equipment or...?

Agent: Great choice! So, with Frontier Fiber, the good news is your current equipment is compatible. You shouldn't need to swap anything out. I can push through an upgrade on my end here, and the new speeds should activate within the next 24 to 48 hours. You might experience a brief service interruption—maybe 5 to 10 minutes—but it should be pretty seamless.

Customer: Okay, cool. And that's it? I don't have to wait for a technician or anything?

Agent: Nope, we've got you covered. It's all remote. (typing sounds) Just to confirm everything: I'm upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 200, loyalty rate of $64.99 for 12 months, then $89.99 after. Your service address is still... (pause) ...2847 Riverside Drive in Portland, correct?

Customer: That's right.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I've submitted the upgrade request. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour or so. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks, Marcus. I appreciate you taking care of that for me.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being such a loyal customer. If you have any issues with the transition or questions down the road, please don't hesitate to give us a call. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
