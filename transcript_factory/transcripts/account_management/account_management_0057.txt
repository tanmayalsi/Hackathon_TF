Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've had the same plan for like three years now and I think it's time for something faster.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. One moment... Okay, I've got you here. I see you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. A hundred megs, right?

Agent: That's right—100 megabits per second download. And how long have you been with us?

Customer: Like I said, probably about three years. Maybe a little longer. I've been pretty happy with it, but honestly, it's been getting a little sluggish lately. I work from home now, and I'm doing a lot of video calls and uploading files, and... I don't know, it just feels slow sometimes.

Agent: I totally understand. Working from home definitely puts more demands on your connection. The good news is we've got some great options for you. What kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you thinking maybe double what you have now, or...?

Customer: Well, what do you recommend? Like, what's the next step up?

Agent: (pause) So we have our Fiber 300 plan at 300 megabits per second, and then we also have our Fiber Gig plan, which is gigabit speeds—that's 940 megs down. The 300 would be really solid for remote work with multiple video calls and file uploads. The Gig is more if you've got a whole household using the connection heavily at the same time.

Customer: How many people are we talking about? Like, how many devices?

Agent: Well, that depends on how many people are in your home and what they're doing. Are you living alone, or...?

Customer: No, I've got my spouse and my two teenagers. So there's four of us. My kids are always on their laptops for school stuff, and my spouse streams during lunch breaks... yeah, I guess that's quite a bit going on at once.

Agent: Okay, so with four people potentially using bandwidth simultaneously, I'd honestly recommend at least the Fiber 300. That would give you plenty of headroom. But the Fiber Gig would really future-proof you, especially with the kids doing schoolwork online.

Customer: What's the price difference?

Agent: (typing sounds) Good question. Let me pull up the current promotions... So right now, the Fiber 300 is $79.99 a month for the first year, then it goes to $99.99. And the Fiber Gig is $119.99 for the first year, then $139.99 after that.

Customer: Okay, so... (pause) how much more is that compared to what I'm paying now?

Agent: What are you currently paying per month for the Fiber 100?

Customer: I think it's like $59.99, but honestly I'm not sure. Could be higher.

Agent: Okay, so the Fiber 300 would be a $20 increase per month to start, and then $40 after the first year. The Gig would be $60 more now and $80 after year one.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Can I do the 300 plan for now? I can always upgrade later if I need to, right?

Agent: Absolutely, yeah. You can always upgrade whenever you want. So let me get some details here. Is the service address still the same as what I'm showing on the account?

Customer: Yeah, 842 Riverside Drive, that's the same.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you're looking at the Fiber 300 plan. I can get you set up at $79.99 for the first year. Now, I do have to let you know there's a one-time equipment fee of $99.99 for the new modem and router, but—actually, hold on, let me see if there's a promotional waiver on that. (typing sounds) (pause) You know what, because you're a loyal customer and you're upgrading, I can get that equipment fee waived for you.

Customer: Oh, really? That's great. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. So you'd be saving about a hundred dollars right there. Now, when would you like to schedule the installation? We can typically get a technician out within 3 to 5 business days.

Customer: Um, let me think... this Friday? Would Friday work?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability... Yeah, we've got an open window on Friday between 9 AM and 1 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Actually, I work during those hours. Do you have anything in the afternoon?

Agent: We do have a 1 PM to 5 PM window available on Friday as well.

Customer: Yeah, 1 to 5 works better. I can make that happen.

Agent: Perfect! (typing sounds) I've got you scheduled for this Friday, [inaudible] the 1 to 5 PM appointment. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive. They'll install the new modem, set up your router, and make sure everything's running smoothly. The whole thing usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour.

Customer: Cool. And I don't need to do anything ahead of time?

Agent: Nope, just make sure someone's home at that address, and we'll take care of the rest. Oh, and just so you know, you might experience a brief service interruption during the installation—maybe a few minutes—but that's totally normal.

Customer: Okay, got it. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: (pause) Let me think... You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details. And if you have any questions before Friday, you can always call us back. When the technician arrives, they'll also walk you through how to use the new equipment if you need it.

Customer: Great. That all sounds good. Thanks for helping me with this.

Agent: My pleasure! Thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer, and thanks for upgrading with us. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Have a good one.

Agent: You too! Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you Friday!

Customer: Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
