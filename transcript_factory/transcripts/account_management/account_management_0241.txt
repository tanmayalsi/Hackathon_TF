# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. I've got the 100 meg plan right now, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've had a lot of customers mentioning that, especially with everything being streamed and worked from home these days. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're on our 100 Mbps Fiber plan. Can I ask what's driving the upgrade? Are you working from home, or...?

Customer: Both, actually. My wife and I both work from home now, and we've got two kids doing remote school stuff. So there's like... a lot of devices going at once. We're getting buffering on video calls, and it's just frustrating, you know?

Agent: Oh yeah, that makes total sense. With multiple people streaming and video conferencing simultaneously, 100 megs can definitely get stretched thin. (pause) The good news is we have some great options available at your address. We can bump you up to our 500 Mbps plan, or if you want to go all out, we've got our 1 Gig plan.

Customer: Wow, okay. What's the price difference? Like, how much more would that be?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here. So you're currently paying... $69.99 a month for the 100 meg plan, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: Alright, so for the 500 Mbps plan, we can get you set up at $89.99 per month for the first year with our promotional rate. After that, it goes to $99.99. And then the 1 Gig plan is $129.99 for year one, then $139.99 after.

Customer: Hmm, so that's like twenty bucks more for the 500 meg plan?

Agent: Exactly, yeah. Twenty dollars for the first twelve months. And honestly, for your situation, I think the 500 would be a really solid middle ground. It's a huge jump from what you've got, and it should handle multiple video calls and streaming without any issues.

Customer: What about the gig plan? Is that like... noticeably better, or would I be overpaying?

Agent: (pause) That's a fair question. So the 1 Gig is definitely overkill for most households, even busy ones like yours. You'd see maybe marginal improvements in real-world usage compared to the 500. The 500 is really where you get the best bang for your buck. Plus, you can always upgrade later if you need to.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. I think the 500 sounds good. Do I need a new modem or anything?

Agent: Great choice. (typing sounds) Let me check what equipment you currently have... You're on our standard router. Yeah, so we'll need to send you an upgraded modem and router combo to handle those speeds. There's no charge for that—we'll swap it out.

Customer: Oh nice. How long does that take?

Agent: We can get that shipped out to you within three to five business days, and it's totally plug-and-play. I can email you instructions, but honestly, it's just a matter of connecting it and powering it on. Your old equipment, you'll just return in the prepaid shipping label we include.

Customer: Perfect. And when would this upgrade take effect? Like, do I have to wait for the equipment?

Agent: (typing sounds) So we can activate the plan immediately—today, if you'd like. The speed upgrade goes live right away on your current equipment, though you won't experience the full 500 until the new modem arrives. But you should definitely see an improvement once that's here.

Customer: That's awesome. Okay, let's do it. What do I need to do?

Agent: Alright, I'll just need to confirm a few things. Your service address is still 412 Maple Street, unit 3B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) And the best contact number is this 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell. That's fine.

Agent: Great. So just to recap—we're upgrading you from the 100 Mbps plan to the 500 Mbps plan. Your new monthly rate will be $89.99 for the first twelve months, then $99.99 after that. We'll be sending out new equipment at no charge, and you should receive it within three to five business days. The speed upgrade takes effect today. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm processing that now. (pause) One moment... (more typing) And... all set! Your upgrade is confirmed. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with your order details and tracking information for the equipment shipment.

Customer: Awesome. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Just keep an eye out for that shipment. If you have any issues installing the new equipment or if something doesn't work right once it arrives, just give us a call back and we'll walk you through it. But honestly, it's pretty straightforward.

Customer: Great. I think that's all I needed. Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. Enjoy that faster internet!

Customer: Will do. Thanks again, have a good one.

Agent: You too. Take care!
