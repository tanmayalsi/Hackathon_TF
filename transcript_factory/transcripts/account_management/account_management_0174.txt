# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I want to look into upgrading my internet. I currently have the 100 meg plan and I'm thinking I might need something faster.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 423 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Awesome. So I'm seeing here that you've been with us for about three years on our Fiber 100 plan. What's prompting the upgrade? Are you having any issues with your current speeds, or has your usage just increased?

Customer: Well, honestly, it's been fine for a while, but I've been working from home more now, and my roommate is streaming stuff constantly. Like, it was okay before, but now when we're both online it gets kind of slow. I was thinking maybe the 500 meg plan or something?

Agent: That makes total sense. Working from home and sharing bandwidth can definitely increase your needs. Before we talk about the 500, let me ask you a couple quick questions. Are you doing things like video conferencing for work?

Customer: Yeah, I'm on Zoom calls pretty much all day.

Agent: Okay, and does your roommate stream in 4K or just standard HD?

Customer: I think it's just regular HD, but he's on Netflix like constantly. (pause) Sometimes we both have stuff going on at the same time and pages just take forever to load.

Agent: Right, I totally get it. So here's the thing—with your usage pattern, honestly, the 500 plan would probably be overkill. I'd actually recommend our Fiber 300 plan. It's perfect for multiple users with streaming and working from home. You'd be getting a really nice boost without paying for more than you need.

Customer: Oh, okay. How much more would that run me?

Agent: Let me pull that up for you. (typing sounds) So you're currently at $69.99 a month, right?

Customer: Yeah, sounds about right.

Agent: The Fiber 300 plan is $89.99 a month, so you're looking at about a $20 increase. But here's what's great—we're running a promotion right now where if you bundle it with our phone service, we can knock that down to $79.99 for the first year. Do you currently have phone service with us?

Customer: No, I actually have... I don't know, I think it's through some VOIP thing. Honestly, I barely use it. Do I need to add that?

Agent: You don't *have* to, but it's a nice way to save if you want the bundle. But no pressure. The main thing is getting you that faster speed, right?

Customer: Yeah, I think just the internet upgrade is what I want to focus on for now.

Agent: Perfect, no problem at all. So we'd be upgrading you to Fiber 300 at $89.99 a month. I should mention the installation is free since you're already a customer, and the upgrade typically takes three to five business days. We can schedule a technician to come out and upgrade your equipment.

Customer: Oh, do I need new equipment?

Agent: So you'll need a new modem and router to get the speeds from the 300 plan. The technician will bring that, install it, and get everything set up for you. It usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes.

Customer: Okay, that's fine. When could I get that done? Like, can I do it soon?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. What does your schedule look like? Do you have any preference for mornings or afternoons?

Customer: Um, I need to work from home, so maybe early morning before my first meeting? Like, before 9 AM?

Agent: That's perfect. Let me look at... (pause) Okay, how about this Friday, October 18th, between 7 and 9 AM?

Customer: This Friday? Yeah, that works.

Agent: Excellent. I'm going to set that up for you now. (typing sounds) And just to confirm, we'll have a technician at 423 Maple Street between 7 and 9 AM on Friday the 18th. You'll get an email confirmation, and we'll also send you a text reminder the day before.

Customer: Great, thank you.

Agent: Just one more thing—is the phone number 555-0147 still the best way to reach you if our technician needs to contact you?

Customer: Yes, that's my cell, so that's perfect.

Agent: Perfect. So let me just recap everything for you. We're upgrading your service from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, which increases your speed to 300 megabits per second. Your new rate is $89.99 a month starting next month. The installation is scheduled for Friday, October 18th between 7 and 9 AM, and it's completely free.

Customer: Sounds good. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home to let the technician in, and... honestly, that's about it. They'll handle everything else. Oh, and if you have any questions before Friday, just give us a call back.

Customer: Will my internet go down during the installation?

Agent: Yeah, there will be a brief window where it's down—probably just 15, 20 minutes or so—while they're making the switch. So just plan for that if you have any early morning calls.

Customer: Oh, okay. I probably should let my work know then.

Agent: Yeah, that might be a good idea. Just to be safe.

Customer: All right, I think that's everything. Thank you for helping me with this.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think I'm all set.

Agent: Great! Have a fantastic day, and we'll see you on Friday.

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
