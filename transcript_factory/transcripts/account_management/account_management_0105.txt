Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with your service, but I'm thinking I need to upgrade. My internet's been feeling pretty slow lately.

Agent: Great, I appreciate that feedback. I'm glad you've been happy with us. Let me help you figure out what would work best. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 503-555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. Okay, so I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 300 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. 300 megs, I think?

Agent: Exactly. So 300 megabits per second download speeds. What kind of activities are you doing that's making you feel like you need more speed? Just so I can recommend the best option for you.

Customer: Well, I work from home, so I'm on video calls basically all day. And my wife, she likes to stream shows in the evening, and then my kids are always downloading games or... (pause) I don't know, doing whatever kids do online. It just feels like everything's buffering, you know?

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally understand. That's a pretty common situation, especially with multiple people using the connection at once. Video conferencing definitely needs consistent bandwidth. So with Fiber 300, you've got plenty for one or two activities, but when everyone's online simultaneously, that's when you'd feel the slowdown.

Customer: Right, exactly. So what would you recommend?

Agent: Well, we have a few options. We could move you to our Fiber 500 plan, which would give you 500 megs down. That's a pretty popular sweet spot. Or if you want to really future-proof yourself, we have Fiber 1 Gig, which is our top tier—that's one gigabit per second.

Customer: Wow, okay. What's the price difference on those?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Good question. So you're currently paying... let me see here... $79.99 a month for the 300 plan, is that right?

Customer: Uh, I think so. Maybe a little more now? I feel like it went up last year or something.

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, I hear that a lot. It looks like you might be on a promotional rate that's expired. Let me see what we can do for you. If we move you to the Fiber 500, I can get you that for $99.99 a month for the first year, and then it would go to $119.99 after that. For the Fiber 1 Gig, we're looking at $149.99 for year one, then $169.99.

Customer: Hmm. Okay, so would the 500 be enough, or should I just bite the bullet and go with the gig?

Agent: That's really up to your needs and budget. Honestly, for your situation—with the work-from-home video calls, streaming, and gaming—the 500 would probably handle everything really well. The gig is amazing if you want that extra headroom, but it's also almost fifty bucks more a month.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think... I mean, the 500 sounds pretty reasonable. And I can always upgrade later if I need to, right?

Agent: Absolutely. You can always upgrade anytime you want. So let's go ahead and get you set up with the Fiber 500. I should mention, since you're upgrading, there's no installation fee, and we can actually get this activated within the next two business days. Do you still have the same equipment, or would you want us to send out a new modem and router?

Customer: Oh, I didn't think about that. What's the difference? Are they better?

Agent: Our newer equipment is definitely more powerful and has better Wi-Fi coverage. If you're in a bigger home or farther from where your modem is, the newer router can make a noticeable difference. Plus, it handles the gigabit speeds better, and honestly, it just tends to be more reliable.

Customer: (pause) Sure, yeah, let's go with the new equipment then.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm setting that up for you now. We'll ship that out today, and you should receive it... looks like that would be Wednesday or Thursday. You'll get an email with a tracking number. The activation is super easy—you just plug it in, and it should automatically connect to your account.

Customer: Nice. Do I need to do anything on my end before they arrive, or...?

Agent: Nope, nothing at all. Just keep your current modem and router plugged in until the new ones arrive. Once you get the new equipment, you can unplug the old stuff and return it in the shipping box that comes with the new ones. You can either mail it back or drop it off at any Frontier retail location.

Customer: Okay, that's pretty straightforward. And this pricing, the $99.99, that's locked in for a year, right?

Agent: (pause) Yes, for the first twelve months. After that, it would go to the regular rate of $119.99 unless we have any promotions running at that time.

Customer: Alright, sounds good. Um, is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Let me just confirm everything for you. So we're upgrading you from Fiber 300 to Fiber 500, same address, new modem and router being shipped out today, $99.99 for the first year, and we'll have you activated within two business days. You should see speeds improvement pretty much immediately once everything's set up.

Customer: That all sounds perfect. I'm really happy with this.

Agent: Excellent. I'm glad I could help. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details of your upgrade and your tracking information for the equipment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. If you have any questions once the equipment arrives, just give us a call back or you can chat with us online. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Thanks again. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
