Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. I've been with you guys for like, what, three years now? And honestly, my speeds have been pretty slow lately.

Agent: I appreciate you calling in. I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me just pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm showing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I think it was fine when I first got it, but now I'm working from home more, and my wife streams a lot of Netflix, so... it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. That's actually one of the most common reasons we see people upgrading. So with multiple people using the connection at the same time, you're probably experiencing some lag and buffering, yeah?

Customer: Exactly. Like, I'll be in a video call and the quality just tanks if she starts watching something. It's pretty frustrating.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. So let me tell you what we have available in your area. We currently offer Fiber 200, Fiber 500, and our Fiber 1 Gig plan. The Fiber 1 Gig is really our premium offering—that's 1,000 megabits per second. (pause) That would definitely handle both of you streaming and video conferencing at the same time without any issues.

Customer: Wow, 1,000? That seems... like a lot. Is that overkill for what I need?

Agent: It might be, honestly. Let me ask you this—besides your wife streaming and your video calls, do you do anything else that's pretty data-heavy? Gaming, uploading large files, that kind of thing?

Customer: Not really, no. I mean, I work in marketing, so I'm uploading files to the cloud sometimes, but nothing huge. Just regular office stuff.

Agent: Right. In that case, I'd probably recommend our Fiber 500 plan. That's 500 megabits per second, and that'll give you plenty of headroom for both of you using the connection simultaneously, plus any file uploads you might need to do. And it's a nice sweet spot price-wise too.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that sounds more reasonable. What's the difference in price?

Agent: (typing sounds) So you're currently paying $59.99 a month for the Fiber 100. The Fiber 500 would be $79.99 a month for the first year. After that, it goes to $89.99, but we can revisit that when your promotional period ends.

Customer: Hmm. So an extra twenty bucks a month... that's manageable. What's the deal with the first year thing?

Agent: Good question. So we have promotional pricing for the first 12 months, which locks in that $79.99 rate. After the first year, it adjusts to the regular rate of $89.99 a month. But like I said, we can look at what promotions might be available at that time, so your rate might stay the same or we could find something else.

Customer: Okay, that's fair. Do I need new equipment or anything?

Agent: Let me check here. (pause) (typing sounds) So you have our standard fiber gateway now, which is compatible with the Fiber 500 plan, so you shouldn't need a new modem. However, I would recommend a router upgrade to really take full advantage of those speeds. We have a premium WiFi 6 router we can send out, and that's... $15 a month to lease, or you could purchase one yourself if you prefer.

Customer: What's the difference between leasing and buying?

Agent: Well, with leasing through us, if anything goes wrong with it, we'll replace it for free. If you buy your own, that's all on you. But obviously, if you buy, you own it outright and don't have that monthly fee. A good WiFi 6 router runs about... $150 to $200 if you're buying on your own.

Customer: (pause) I think I'll just lease it from you guys. Seems easier, and I like the warranty thing.

Agent: Smart choice. So let me recap what we're looking at here. We'd be upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500, adding the premium WiFi 6 router lease, and your new total would be $94.99 a month for the first year. (pause) How does that sound?

Customer: Yeah, that works for me. When can you get that set up?

Agent: Great! So I can process this upgrade for you right now. (typing sounds) The good news is that since you already have fiber to your address, we don't need a technician to come out. I can provision this on our end, and your speeds should increase within the next 24 hours. In the meantime, I'll have that router shipped out to you, and it should arrive within 5 to 7 business days.

Customer: Oh perfect. That's faster than I thought.

Agent: Yeah, we try to keep it quick. (pause) And I'll send you an email confirmation with all the details of your new plan, your new billing information, and a tracking number for the router once it ships out.

Customer: That's great. Anything else I need to do?

Agent: Not really on your end. Just keep an eye out for the router, get it set up when it arrives—I can email you instructions, but it's pretty straightforward—and you should be all set. Once you power cycle your gateway after the upgrade goes through, you should see those speeds right away.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. I appreciate your business, and enjoy those faster speeds! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: Nope, that's everything.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
