Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on the 500 megabit plan, and honestly, I'm thinking about upgrading. My internet's been pretty good, but I've got three kids now doing remote school and we're all working from home, so...

Agent: Oh wow, three kids! (typing sounds) Yeah, that can definitely add up bandwidth-wise. I totally understand. Let me pull up your account here real quick.

Customer: Thanks. We've got like... I think we have five devices going at once sometimes? Tablets, laptops, and my youngest is always on YouTube.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so you're looking at quite a bit of concurrent usage. I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years, and you're in the Austin area?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. We're actually in Round Rock, north of Austin.

Agent: Perfect. So with the 500 meg plan you're on now, that's pretty solid, but you're right—with that kind of usage, we might want to look at something beefier. Have you been experiencing any slowdowns?

Customer: Um, yeah, actually. Like, sometimes when everyone's on at the same time, things just... bog down? My wife will be on a Zoom call and suddenly her screen's freezing up. It's kind of annoying.

Agent: Yeah, that's definitely frustrating, especially when you're trying to work. So we've got a couple options for you. We can upgrade you to our gig plan—that's one gigabit per second—or there's our 750 meg option if you want something in between. What kind of budget range are you thinking?

Customer: Honestly, I don't know what the pricing looks like. What's the difference between the two?

Agent: (typing) Great question. So the 750 meg is gonna run you $89.99 a month for the first year, and then it goes to the regular rate of $119.99. The gig plan is $109.99 for the first year, then $149.99 after that. Both come with our equipment rental included, and you'd be getting our newest router.

Customer: Wow, okay. That's... (pause) that's a decent jump from what I'm paying now. What am I paying currently?

Agent: You're at $69.99 a month right now on the 500 meg plan.

Customer: Okay, so the gig would be like forty more a month initially. And you said the speeds would be... one gigabit?

Agent: Exactly. One gigabit down. That's about two times what you're getting now. Honestly, with what you described with the freezing and multiple devices, I'd probably recommend the gig. It's got way more headroom, and you won't run into those congestion issues.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that makes sense. Is there like... any kind of promotion or anything? Do I get a discount for being a long-term customer or...?

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) Let me see what I can do here for you. You've been a great customer for three years, so... (more typing) Okay, I can apply a one-time $50 credit to your account as a loyalty bonus. That'll help offset the upgrade cost.

Customer: Oh, nice! That's helpful. Okay, so I think I want to go with the gig plan then.

Agent: Awesome choice. I think you're gonna love it. So just to confirm everything—we're upgrading your service to one gigabit per second, which starts at $109.99 a month for the first twelve months. You'll get a $50 loyalty credit applied, and we're sending out a new modem and router, which should arrive within three to five business days.

Customer: Wait, three to five business days? We kind of need it sooner. Can it come faster?

Agent: (pause) Let me check our expedited shipping options. Unfortunately, with your zip code, I'm not seeing expedited available right now. However, if you need to upgrade immediately, you could swing by one of our retail locations and pick up equipment today. There's one on North I-35 in Round Rock, actually. But most customers are fine with the standard delivery.

Customer: No, three to five days is probably okay. We can work around it. I just wanted to ask.

Agent: That's totally fair. One thing I should mention—once your new equipment arrives, you'll want to set it up before your service officially upgrades, so you're ready to go. Do you feel comfortable doing that, or would you like to schedule a technician to come out and do it for you?

Customer: I think I can handle it. I've set up routers before, so...

Agent: Perfect. You'll get an email with setup instructions once the equipment ships out. And actually, there's a QR code you can scan for a video walkthrough if you need it. So, um... (pause) can I also interest you in our phone service today? We've got some pretty competitive rates if you're looking to bundle.

Customer: (laughs) No, no. We're good on phone. We've got our cell phones.

Agent: (chuckles) Totally understand. Can't blame you. Alright, so we're all set then. Let me just... (typing) ...get your confirmation number here. You're gonna receive an order confirmation email in just a moment. That's 4-7-8-9-2-5-C. Got that?

Customer: Yeah, 478925C. Got it.

Agent: Perfect. And you're gonna see the $50 credit reflected on your next bill, and the new charges start on your next billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Marcus. I appreciate it.

Agent: Hey, you're very welcome! Thanks for being such a loyal Frontier customer, and I really think you're gonna be happy with those speeds. If you have any questions during the install process, you can always reach out to us at the number on your bill. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Thanks again.

Agent: Bye now!
