Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan, and honestly, I'm thinking about upgrading. My work from home situation has gotten a lot more intense lately, and I feel like I'm hitting some speed bumps.

Agent: Okay, great! I'm glad you reached out. I'd be happy to help you explore some options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account real quick?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's Marcus Chen.

Agent: (pause) Alright Marcus, I'm pulling up your account here... Okay, so I can see you've been with us since 2019 on that 500 meg plan. And you mentioned you're experiencing some slowdowns?

Customer: Well, not exactly slowdowns, but like... I do a lot of video conferencing, and sometimes when my partner is streaming in the other room, things get choppy, you know? Plus, I've got smart home stuff set up now, and I read that fiber speeds are way faster. I figure if I'm gonna invest in this, might as well go all the way.

Agent: That makes total sense. Video conferencing and multiple devices can definitely tax your bandwidth. The good news is you're already in a fiber area, so we can absolutely get you bumped up. (typing sounds) Let me show you what we have available. So we've got our 1 gig fiber plan, which is our top tier. That's 1,000 megabits up and down, so it's symmetrical.

Customer: Okay, wow. That seems like... a lot. Is that overkill for what I described?

Agent: (chuckles) Well, it depends on your usage, but let me break it down. For what you're doing with video conferencing and streaming simultaneously, you'd honestly be really comfortable on our 750 meg plan. That's a nice sweet spot. You'd have plenty of overhead, and your partner could stream 4K without any issues while you're on a call.

Customer: How much more would that be versus what I'm paying now?

Agent: (typing sounds) So you're currently at... looks like $79.99 a month for the 500 meg plan. Our 750 meg plan is $99.99 a month, so that's a $20 increase.

Customer: Oh, that's not too bad actually. And then the gig plan?

Agent: The gig plan is $129.99 a month, so that's $50 more than what you're paying now. A lot of customers go with that if they think they might want more headroom for future expansion or if they have several people working from home.

Customer: I mean, it's just me and my partner, and she's not really doing intense computing or anything. I think 750 might be the move. How would the installation work? Can you guys upgrade it without like, tearing up my yard again?

Agent: (pause) Good question. Since you're already on fiber, we can typically just swap out your equipment and upgrade your modem and router. In most cases, we don't need to do any digging. Let me just check your setup here... (typing sounds) Okay, so you've got our standard fiber gateway unit, right?

Customer: Yeah, the white box thing.

Agent: That's the one. Perfect. So we'd send you a new gateway that supports the higher speeds, and one of our technicians would come out to swap it out and make sure everything's configured correctly. Usually takes about an hour or so.

Customer: Cool. And when could that happen?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) We've got some openings next week. We have Tuesday between 1 and 5 PM, or Thursday morning between 8 AM and noon. What works better for you?

Customer: Uh, Thursday morning would be great. I have meetings Tuesday afternoon.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm gonna lock you in for Thursday, the 14th, between 8 and noon. (typing sounds) Our tech will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive to confirm. Is the number I'm calling from the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Excellent. Now, I should mention we do have a promotion running right now. If you bundle your internet with our TV service, you can get your first three months of the 750 meg plan at $79.99 instead of $99.99. Are you interested in adding TV?

Customer: (pause) Uh, no thanks. I mostly just use streaming services. I don't really watch cable anymore.

Agent: No problem, I totally understand. So here's what I'm gonna do. I can offer you a one-time $50 credit on your first bill just for upgrading. How does that sound?

Customer: That's... actually really nice, Derek. Yeah, I'll take that.

Agent: Awesome! Let me get that applied. (typing sounds) Okay, so to recap: you're upgrading from 500 meg to 750 meg fiber, new rate is $99.99 a month, you've got a $50 credit on your first bill, and your installation is scheduled for Thursday the 14th between 8 AM and noon. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes. Do you have any other questions?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. This should definitely help with everything. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Marcus. We appreciate your business, and I'm glad we could find a solution that works for you. You're all set. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Bye now.
