Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! We've got some great options available. Before we get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. We've got three roommates now, and everybody's streaming and working from home. A hundred megs just isn't enough anymore. I'm getting frustrated with the buffering and... it's just slow.

Agent: I totally understand. With multiple people working and streaming simultaneously, you definitely need more bandwidth. The good news is, you're in a great area for our upgraded fiber speeds. Are you familiar with our Fiber 300 or Fiber 500 plans?

Customer: I've heard about them, but honestly, I'm not sure what the difference is. What would you recommend?

Agent: Great question. So Fiber 300 gives you 300 megabits per second, which is really solid for a household with multiple users. It's perfect for 4K streaming and video conferencing without any lag. Then we've got Fiber 500, which is our top tier at 500 megs. That's ideal if you're doing heavy gaming, lots of simultaneous uploads, that kind of thing.

Customer: Hmm. How much more is the 500 compared to what I'm paying now?

Agent: (typing sounds) So you're currently at $64.99 a month for the Fiber 100. The Fiber 300 would be $84.99, and the Fiber 500 is $109.99. However, I do have a promotional offer available right now. If you upgrade to the Fiber 500 today, I can get you that price locked in at $89.99 for the first 12 months.

Customer: Oh, okay. That's... that's actually not too bad. What about after the 12 months?

Agent: After the promotional period, it would move to the regular rate of $109.99. But honestly, at that price point, you're getting an incredible amount of speed and reliability. Plus, with our Fiber service, you're getting dedicated bandwidth, so you won't see slowdowns during peak hours like you might with cable.

Customer: Right, right. (pause) Yeah, I think the 500 makes sense then. Can you upgrade me today?

Agent: Absolutely! I can definitely process that for you. Just to confirm a few things—your service address is still 412 Maple Street, Apartment 3B?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And we won't have any issues with the modem you have now, but I do want to let you know that our Fiber 500 service will require our newer gateway modem. We can ship that out to you at no charge, and it'll arrive within three to five business days. Your service will be upgraded as soon as the new modem is activated.

Customer: Oh, so there's downtime? Like, when does that happen?

Agent: Good question. The upgrade itself is remote, so there's no technician visit needed. Once your new modem arrives, you'll just unbox it, connect it, and power it on. The activation takes about ten minutes, and then you're good to go. You might experience a brief interruption—maybe two or three minutes—during that changeover, but that's it.

Customer: Okay, that works. When would it ship out?

Agent: (typing sounds) I'm initiating the order right now, so it should ship out by tomorrow. Like I said, three to five business days. You'll get a tracking number emailed to you within 24 hours.

Customer: Great.

Agent: Alright, so let me review everything with you. We're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500, locked in at $89.99 per month for the first 12 months, regular rate after that. Your new gateway modem will be shipped at no cost. The service upgrade will happen once you activate the modem. Is there anything else I can help clarify?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. What about my bill? When does that change?

Agent: Your new rate will be reflected on your next billing cycle, which looks like... (typing sounds) the 15th of next month. You'll receive a new invoice showing the updated amount. And hey, with the speeds you're about to get, you're going to notice a huge difference with everything—streaming, downloads, all of it.

Customer: (laughs) Yeah, I'm looking forward to it, honestly. My roommates are gonna be happy too.

Agent: Awesome! Well, thank you for choosing Frontier, and thank you for your business. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day, and enjoy that faster internet.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye now.
