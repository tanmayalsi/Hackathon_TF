Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore. I'm working from home now, and my wife streams a lot, plus we've got two kids doing online school. It's just... it gets pretty slow sometimes.

Agent: I completely understand. Working from home definitely puts more demand on your connection. (typing sounds) Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're on our 500 meg plan currently. That's a solid speed, but yeah, with multiple people streaming and working simultaneously, I can see why you might be hitting some limitations. Are you looking to upgrade to a higher tier?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. What do you have available? And like... how much more would that cost? I'm hoping it's not too crazy.

Agent: Great question. So in your area, we have a couple options above what you're on now. We offer our 1 gig plan—that's one gigabit per second—and we actually just launched our 2 gig plan, which is our top tier. (pause) The 1 gig plan would be $89 a month, and the 2 gig plan is $119 a month. Those are our promotional rates for the first year.

Customer: Okay, so that's like, what, $30 more for the 1 gig?

Agent: Correct, yes. Thirty dollars more per month.

Customer: Hmm. And what about after the first year? Does it go up?

Agent: (pause) Good question. After year one, the 1 gig plan would be $99 a month, and the 2 gig would be $139 a month. That's our standard rate, but honestly, as a loyal customer—and I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years now—I can make a note on your account that you might qualify for loyalty pricing extensions. I can't guarantee it, but that's something our loyalty team would review.

Customer: Okay, that's helpful. So I guess... what's the real difference between the 1 gig and the 2 gig? Like, will I actually notice it?

Agent: That's a fair question. For your situation—multiple people working and streaming—I'd honestly say the 1 gig plan should handle that really well. The 2 gig plan is more if you're doing really intensive things like uploading large files regularly, multiple video calls simultaneously, that kind of thing. With 1 gig, you're looking at download speeds of up to 1,000 megabits per second. Most streaming services, even 4K streaming, only need about 25 megabits. Work video calls are typically 2.5 to 4 megabits. So you'd have plenty of headroom.

Customer: Yeah, that makes sense. I think 1 gig is probably what I need then.

Agent: I think that's a solid choice. And the good news is there's no equipment fee to upgrade—we'll send you our Frontier advanced modem and router, and it's a pretty quick swap. You just unbox it, plug it in, and you'll be good to go within about 15 minutes.

Customer: Oh nice, so I don't have to schedule a technician or anything?

Agent: Nope. Not for this upgrade. We'll mail it to you—it should arrive within three to five business days—and you can swap it out yourself. We'll include a prepaid shipping label for your old equipment too, so you can just drop that off at any... (pause) ...any UPS location.

Customer: That's awesome. So when would this start?

Agent: The upgrade would be effective... let me see here... (typing sounds) ...the next billing cycle, which would be on the 15th of next month. So you'd get the new equipment before then, and once you switch it out, you'll have those speeds. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Um, one more thing—do I need to do anything with my internet settings or passwords or anything when I switch the equipment?

Agent: Great question. So the new modem and router have default WiFi credentials on the label, but I'd recommend—and we can email you this—logging into the Frontier app or your online account after you set it up, and you can customize your WiFi name and password. Makes it easier to remember, you know?

Customer: Perfect. Yeah, I can do that.

Agent: Excellent. So just to confirm everything—I'm upgrading your service from 500 megabit to 1 gigabit per second, effective your next billing cycle on the 15th. Your new rate is $89 a month for the first year, then $99 after that. You'll receive new equipment in three to five business days, and you can swap it out yourself. We'll email you setup instructions and send a return label for your old modem.

Customer: That's perfect. That's exactly what I need.

Agent: Wonderful. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Marcus. I appreciate you walking me through everything.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your loyalty over the past three years. If you have any questions once you get the equipment or if you need anything else, just give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks again!

Agent: Take care! (call ends)
