Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. My current speed just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause, typing) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. One hundred megs down, right?

Agent: That's right. And you're saying that's not meeting your needs anymore?

Customer: Well, my daughter's been home from college doing remote classes, and my wife streams a lot of Netflix. Plus I work from home most days, so... (trailing off) it just seems like we're constantly buffering or getting kicked off Zoom calls. It's frustrating.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, I totally get that. Multiple users on the network definitely adds up. The good news is you're in our Fiber service area, so you've got some really solid options to choose from. (typing) We currently have Fiber 300, Fiber 500, and our Fiber Gig plan, which is one gigabit per second.

Customer: Okay, so what's the price difference between those?

Agent: Great question. So your current Fiber 100 is $64.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. Maybe 65 with taxes though.

Agent: Right, yeah, taxes and fees are separate. So the Fiber 300 is $84.99 per month. The Fiber 500 is $99.99. And then the Fiber Gig is our premium option at $119.99 per month.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) What would you recommend for our situation?

Agent: Well, it really depends on your usage, but honestly? With three people in the household and remote work and streaming... I'd say the Fiber 500 would be a really solid sweet spot. You'd get five hundred megs down, which is plenty of headroom for everything you're doing. The 300 could work, but if you have multiple Zoom calls happening while someone's streaming 4K, you might still feel some slowness.

Customer: And what about the gig plan?

Agent: The Fiber Gig is amazing if you're really heavy users or you want that future-proof setup, you know? But for most households, even busy ones, the 500 is really the money-maker in terms of value versus performance.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. Are there any... like, promotions or anything going on right now?

Agent: (typing) Let me check what I can do for you here. (pause) Okay, so I'm actually seeing that for your account, I can offer you a promotional rate. If you upgrade to the Fiber 500 today, I can lock you in at $89.99 a month for the first year instead of $99.99. So that saves you ten bucks a month.

Customer: Oh, that's pretty good. What happens after the year?

Agent: After that, it goes to the standard rate of $99.99. But you can always call back at that time to see if we have other promos running. We usually do something for loyal customers like yourself.

Customer: All right, and how quickly can you get that set up?

Agent: Well, since you're already an active Fiber customer, it's super easy. This is essentially a service tier upgrade on your existing connection, so we can actually process this right now and activate it... (pause, typing) ...today. You'd see the speed increase within the next couple of hours once our system updates.

Customer: Seriously? That fast?

Agent: Yep. No technician visit needed or anything. You're all set with your current setup. (typing) Okay, so just to confirm everything—I'm going to upgrade your account from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500. The promotional rate of $89.99 per month for twelve months, then standard rate thereafter. Your first bill reflecting the change will be on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Great. Is there anything else I should know? Like, do I need to restart my modem or anything?

Agent: Good question. So when we push through the upgrade, your modem might restart automatically—that's totally normal. It'll just take a few minutes to reboot. After that, you should see the speed increase. But if for some reason you don't, just give it a restart manually and that'll usually do the trick.

Customer: Okay, got it.

Agent: (typing) And uh, one more thing—I'm actually going to add a three-month credit for you as a thank you for being a great customer all these years. So you'll see that reflected on your next bill as well.

Customer: (pleasantly surprised) Oh, wow, really? That's awesome, thank you!

Agent: Of course! You've been with us for three years, we appreciate that. So is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. I'm really happy with this. Thanks for making it so easy.

Agent: Awesome! You're all set. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details. If you have any issues or questions, you can always reach out to us. Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and enjoy that fast internet!

Customer: Will do. Have a good day, Marcus.

Agent: You too! Thanks for calling.
