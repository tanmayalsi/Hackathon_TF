Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I've had your service for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you calling in. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Just to pull up your account, can I get the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. And just to confirm, is this for the residential account at 2341 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your current speeds aren't meeting your needs. What kind of speeds are you currently on?

Customer: I think it's the 100 meg plan? Maybe 150? I'm not totally sure, to be honest. But I've been working from home more, and my kids are streaming school stuff, and it just seems to lag a lot during peak hours.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I see here you're actually on our 200 Mbps plan, so you've got a pretty solid foundation there. But I totally understand—with multiple devices and streaming happening simultaneously, 200 can definitely feel tight sometimes. What kind of activities are you doing when you notice the slowdown?

Customer: Well, I'm on Zoom calls for work pretty frequently, and then my wife is usually watching something, and my son's got his online classes happening... It's just a lot at once. Plus, honestly, my upload speeds feel really slow when I'm trying to share my screen or upload files.

Agent: That makes complete sense. With that usage pattern, you'd probably benefit from our fiber speeds. We actually have availability in your area for our 500 Mbps plan, or if you really want to future-proof things, our gigabit plan—that's 940 Mbps—is also available. Both have significantly better upload speeds too.

Customer: Okay, so what's the price difference? I'm not trying to break the bank here.

Agent: (pause) Good question. So your current plan is... let me see... you're at $64.99 a month, is that what you've been paying?

Customer: Sounds about right, yeah.

Agent: Alright, so the 500 Mbps plan would be $79.99 a month for the first year, and then it goes to $99.99 after that. The gigabit plan is $109.99 for the first year, and then $129.99 ongoing.

Customer: (pause) So there's a price increase after a year?

Agent: Yes, so our promotional pricing is good for twelve months, and then it adjusts to our standard rate. That said, I want to make sure you're getting the best deal. Are you a long-term customer, did you say three years?

Customer: Yeah, about three years.

Agent: Excellent. Let me see what I can do for you. (typing sounds) You know, because you've been a great customer with us, I can actually offer you the 500 Mbps plan at $79.99 for the first year, but I can extend that rate to 24 months instead of just 12. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh, that's... that's actually really helpful. (pause) Yeah, that would be great. So I'd be paying $79.99 for two years?

Agent: Exactly right. And after that, it would go to the standard rate. But that gives you two years at that promotional price.

Customer: Okay, and there's no equipment fee or anything like that?

Agent: Great question. So our fiber modem and router are included at no charge, and the installation fee would normally be $99, but I can waive that for you given your account history.

Customer: Wait, seriously? That's awesome. Okay, I'm sold. Let's do the 500 Meg plan.

Agent: Fantastic. I'm going to get this set up for you. (typing sounds) So just to confirm everything: we're upgrading you to 500 Mbps, promotional rate of $79.99 for 24 months, waived installation fee, and new equipment will be shipped to you at no charge...

Customer: Yep, that all sounds good.

Agent: Perfect. We can have the new equipment to you within 3 to 5 business days, and then our installation team can come out to set everything up. Would you prefer a weekday or weekend appointment?

Customer: Um, probably Saturday if that's available? I'm pretty busy during the week.

Agent: (pause) Let me check our availability... (typing sounds) I'm showing we have Saturday between 12 and 4 PM available this coming weekend. Does that work?

Customer: This coming Saturday? Yeah, that works. That's the 14th, right?

Agent: Yes, the 14th. Perfect. So we'll have our technician there between noon and 4 PM. They'll install the new equipment and make sure everything's running smoothly for you.

Customer: Awesome. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Not really. Just make sure someone's home for the appointment, and if you have any other devices connected to your Wi-Fi, you'll want to reconnect them once we get the new router set up. Our technician can walk you through that though.

Customer: Okay, great. And just to be clear, I don't have to send back my old equipment or anything?

Agent: Good thinking. So yes, our technician will actually take the old modem and router with them when they leave, so you don't need to worry about that.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: I think we're all set. I'm going to send you a confirmation email here in just a moment with all the details—the appointment time, the service details, and your new rate. Your service upgrade is effective immediately in our system, but you'll start seeing those speeds once the new equipment is installed on the 14th.

Customer: Great, thank you so much. I really appreciate you waiving the installation fee and extending that promotional rate.

Agent: Of course! You've been a loyal customer, and we appreciate your business. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you on Saturday the 14th. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
