# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've got the 100 meg plan right now, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. A lot of customers find themselves in that situation, especially if you're working from home or have multiple devices connected. Let me pull up your account real quick.

(typing sounds)

Agent: Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Uh, yeah. It's 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. And can I get your last name to verify?

Customer: It's Martinez. M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z.

Agent: (typing) Great, Marcus, I've got you here. So I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years on our 100 megabit plan. That's fantastic. What kind of speeds are you looking to upgrade to?

Customer: Well, actually it's Mike, not Marcus, but—

Agent: Oh, my apologies! Mike, I'm sorry about that.

Customer: No worries. Um, so I'm not totally sure what I need, to be honest. My girlfriend moved in about six months ago, and we're both working from home now, plus we've got the Ring doorbell, nest camera, smart TV... it's just gotten slower, you know?

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. With two people working from home simultaneously, you're probably hitting some bandwidth limits, especially if you're doing any video conferencing. We've got a couple of great options for you. We have our 400 meg plan, which is pretty popular, and we also have our gigabit plan if you want maximum speeds.

Customer: Wait, gigabit? Is that like a thousand megs?

Agent: Exactly, yes. One thousand megabits per second. It's... (pause) it's pretty robust for pretty much anything you'd need to do.

Customer: (laughs) Okay, that sounds like overkill. What's the price difference between the 400 and the gigabit?

Agent: Great question. So right now, I've got a promotional offer running. The 400 meg plan is $79.99 a month for the first twelve months, then it goes to $99.99. And the gigabit is $99.99 for the first year, then $129.99 after that.

Customer: Oh, wow. So it's only like twenty bucks more for gigabit?

Agent: That's correct. And honestly, with the current promotion, that's a pretty solid deal. Plus, if you add our phone service or TV package, I can bundle some additional discounts on top of that.

Customer: Hmm, we're not really interested in phone or TV. We've got Netflix and all that stuff already. But... I mean, the gigabit does sound good. What's the installation like? Do I have to take time off work?

Agent: (typing) So you're fiber-ready, which is great news. Installation typically takes about two to three hours, and we can schedule it at a time that works for you. We've got appointments as early as this weekend if you want something quick.

Customer: This weekend? Really?

Agent: Yeah, we've actually got some availability. I'm showing Saturday and Sunday both have some morning slots open. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Saturday morning would be perfect, actually. What time are we talking?

Agent: We have an eight to ten AM window available, or there's also a noon to two PM slot.

Customer: Eight to ten is good. That way we can get it over with.

Agent: (typing) Perfect. Let me just confirm a few things with you. Your service address is still 447 Maple Drive, apartment 3B, correct?

Customer: Yep, that's right.

Agent: And your best contact number is this number I'm calling from?

Customer: Yeah, 555-0147.

Agent: Excellent. (pause) So just to recap: you're upgrading to our gigabit plan, $99.99 for the first twelve months, and we have you scheduled for installation this Saturday, June 15th, between eight and ten AM. Our technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Okay, great. Um, one thing though—I've got the same modem and router I got three years ago. Will that work with the gigabit, or do I need to upgrade that too?

Agent: That's a really good question. What model modem do you have?

Customer: (pause) Uh... I'm not really sure. It's just the one Frontier gave me. It's kind of a white box-shaped thing.

Agent: (typing) Okay, so the good news is our technician can assess your equipment on Saturday. If it's not compatible—which it likely won't be for gigabit speeds—we can swap it out. There's a $10 modem rental fee per month if you choose to use ours, or you can purchase your own if you prefer.

Customer: Oh, so I'd have to pay extra?

Agent: There is the rental fee, yes. But a lot of customers find it convenient since we maintain and support it. If you want, you could also invest in your own modem and router, which might be better long-term if you plan to keep gigabit for a while.

Customer: How much are we talking?

Agent: A quality modem compatible with our gigabit service runs about $120 to $150 usually. You can get them online or at most electronics retailers. But the technician can definitely talk you through all that on Saturday.

Customer: Alright, I'll figure it out. Anything else I need to know?

Agent: I think we're good! Oh, one more thing—I'm gonna email you a confirmation with all these details. And there's a $99 one-time installation fee that will be on your first bill, but that's already factored into what I quoted you.

Customer: Got it. Okay, I think I'm all set. Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: My pleasure, Mike. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. We're excited to get you that gigabit speed. If you have any questions before Saturday, feel free to give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Thanks again.

Agent: Thanks, bye!
