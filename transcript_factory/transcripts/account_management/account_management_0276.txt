Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've actually upgraded our fiber network in a lot of areas, so you might have some great options available now. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one second here... and I'm seeing an account under the name... is this Jennifer Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. So I'm seeing you're currently on our 300 megabit per second plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right. How did you know that?

Agent: It's right here on my screen. So what's been going on? What are you looking to upgrade to?

Customer: Well, my husband and I have been working from home a lot more lately, and our kids are doing online school. So we've got multiple Zoom calls happening at the same time, and it just keeps buffering and dropping. It's really frustrating.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, I hear that all the time. Especially with everyone doing video calls simultaneously. That 300 meg plan just doesn't have the bandwidth for that kind of usage. The good news is, you're in one of our fiber service areas, so we can definitely get you set up with something faster. We've got some really solid options.

Customer: Okay, what would you recommend?

Agent: Well, for your situation with multiple users and video conferencing, I'd say you'd want to look at either our 500 megabit plan or our 1 gigabit plan. The gig plan is honestly... it's amazing. You won't have any issues whatsoever.

Customer: What's the price difference between those?

Agent: (typing sounds) So the 500 meg is $79.99 a month for the first year, and then it goes to $99.99. The 1 gig plan is $109.99 for the first year, then $129.99 after that.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. And how much more would that be than what I'm paying now?

Agent: What are you currently paying per month?

Customer: I think it's around $60-something? Maybe $65?

Agent: (pause) Okay, so yeah, you'd be looking at an increase. But honestly, with the fiber speeds, your experience is going to be completely different. Most of my customers tell me it's totally worth it once they upgrade.

Customer: Hmm. (hesitation) Does the installation cost anything?

Agent: That's a great question. So normally there would be a $99 installation fee, but I actually have a promotion running right now where if you upgrade today, we can waive that fee for you. Plus, you'd get the promotional rate I mentioned locked in for the first year.

Customer: Oh, okay, that's good. Um, how long would installation take?

Agent: So we can typically get a technician out to you within the next week or two, depending on your availability. And the installation usually takes about an hour to an hour and a half. They'll replace your modem and make sure everything's optimized for the new speeds.

Customer: That sounds... actually, that sounds pretty good. I think I want to do the gigabit plan. That way I won't run into these problems again.

Agent: Excellent choice, Jennifer. I think you're really going to be happy with that decision. Let me just... (typing sounds) get you set up here. So I'm going to need to confirm a few things. Your service address is still 4287 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: And your current phone number on file is 555-0147?

Customer: Uh-huh, yes.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, this is for residential service, right? Not a business account?

Customer: Right, just residential. It's for our house.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so I'm going to get this 1 gigabit plan scheduled for you. Now, what days and times work best for you? We're available Monday through Saturday, between 8 AM and 6 PM.

Customer: Um, let me think. How about next Thursday? Is morning better, or...?

Agent: Thursday is great. We have morning availability. How about 9 AM?

Customer: That works for me. Yeah, 9 AM is perfect.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm locking that in for Thursday, [inaudible]... 9 AM. A technician will call you about 30 minutes before arrival just to confirm. And Jennifer, I'm also going to note on your account that you're interested in waiving the installation fee, which we've discussed. That'll definitely process through.

Customer: Okay, great. So what else do I need to do?

Agent: Nothing, really. You're all set on my end. You should see a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details of your appointment. If for any reason you need to reschedule, just give us a call back and we can move things around.

Customer: Awesome. And this gigabit plan, that's... that should be enough for everyone in the house, right?

Agent: Oh, absolutely. A gigabit is overkill for most household situations, to be honest. You're going to have zero issues. (pause) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

Agent: My pleasure, Jennifer. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we look forward to getting you set up with that fiber service. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks again. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
