Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm just... I'm really not happy with my current speeds. I'm paying for the 100 meg plan, but I'm barely getting like 60 when I test it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing slower speeds than expected. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Before we dive in, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Oh, sure. It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing your account. You've been with us since 2021, and you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And like I said, the speeds have just been really disappointing lately. Plus, my wife is working from home now, and my kids are doing online school, so we really need something faster. We're all on the internet at the same time, and everything just slows to a crawl.

Agent: I completely understand. Multiple users definitely puts a strain on the bandwidth. The good news is that you're in one of our Fiber-capable areas, so we have some great options for you. (pause) Before we look at upgrading, let me just ask—when you're testing these speeds, are you typically running a lot of other devices or programs in the background?

Customer: Uh, well, yeah, I mean... there's usually a few things going on. Why, does that matter?

Agent: It can, actually. If you have downloads running or a lot of browser tabs open, that can affect your results. But that said, if you're experiencing slowness during heavy usage, upgrading would definitely help. We have our Fiber 200 plan, which gives you 200 megabits download and 20 megabits upload, and we also have a Fiber Gig plan that's our fastest option—that's 940 megs down.

Customer: Wow, okay. Well, I don't need a gigabit or anything crazy like that. That seems like overkill. What about that 200 plan? How much is that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great question. Our Fiber 200 plan is currently running $79.99 per month for the first 12 months, and then it goes to $99.99 after that. You'd be looking at double the speed of what you have now, which should handle multiple users streaming and working without any issues.

Customer: And what about the gig plan? Just for comparison...

Agent: The Gig plan is $119.99 for the first year, then $139.99. Honestly, for a household with three people online, the 200 plan is usually more than sufficient, but it really depends on your usage. Are you doing a lot of streaming, like 4K video?

Customer: Some, yeah. We watch Netflix and stuff, but I wouldn't say we're doing anything super heavy. I think the 200 plan sounds... actually, that sounds pretty good. How much would I save if I bundle that with my current services?

Agent: (pause, typing) Well, let me check what else you have on your account... Okay, so I'm seeing just the internet service currently. Do you have phone or TV services with us, or are those through other providers?

Customer: We ditched the TV a couple years ago. We just stream everything. And I think our phone is through our cell carriers, so no landline.

Agent: That makes sense. So for internet-only, I don't have a specific bundle discount to apply, but the $79.99 rate for the first year is our promotional pricing, and that's a really solid rate for Fiber 200. Plus, there's no equipment fee for existing customers upgrading, so that'll save you there.

Customer: Oh, that's good. And do I need new equipment or anything?

Agent: You'll get a new modem and router, which we'll send you. We can actually schedule a tech to come install it, or if you're comfortable doing it yourself, we can have it shipped directly to you with instructions.

Customer: How long does that usually take?

Agent: If you schedule an installation, our next available appointment is... (typing sounds) ...we have some openings next Tuesday or Wednesday. Or if you choose self-installation, we can ship it out as early as tomorrow, and you'd have it by Thursday.

Customer: (pause) Self-install sounds easier. Let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm the change—you're going from our Fiber 100 plan at $59.99 to the Fiber 200 plan at $79.99 monthly for the first 12 months. That's an increase of $20 a month. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. And this starts when exactly?

Agent: I can process this change right now, and it'll be active starting tomorrow. We'll get that equipment shipped out tonight, so you should have it by Thursday. Once it arrives, you'll have a window to activate it yourself, and you'll see the faster speeds right away.

Customer: Great. Yeah, let's do it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to go ahead and submit this upgrade for you. Just give me one second... (pause) And... done! Your confirmation number is 7849-FCC-2024. We'll send you a confirmation email with all the details, including tracking information for your equipment.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: Just a couple things. When your equipment arrives, make sure to power down your old modem before connecting the new one. And there's an instruction card in the box that walks you through the whole process step-by-step. If you run into any issues during setup, you can always call us back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. Thank you, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! And hey, hopefully you'll notice a big difference in those speeds once you're upgraded. Thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again!

Agent: Take care!
