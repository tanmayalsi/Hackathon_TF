Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on the 500 meg plan, and honestly, I've been thinking about upgrading. My work-from-home situation has gotten a lot more intense lately, and I feel like I'm hitting some speed bumps.

Agent: I totally understand. More people are working from home these days, and upload speeds can definitely make a difference. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, got it. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing you're on our Gigabit 500 service. That's a solid plan, but I hear you on the upgrades. What kind of speeds are you looking at for your needs? Are you doing video conferencing, file transfers, that kind of thing?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I'm doing like... constant Zoom calls, uploading large design files to the cloud, and honestly, sometimes my roommate's streaming in the other room, so it all kind of adds up.

Agent: Ah, yeah, that'll definitely do it. So you're looking at multiple users and heavy upload demands. In that case, I'd recommend our Gigabit 1 Gig service. That's gonna give you one gigabit up and down, so you'll have plenty of headroom for everything you're doing. We just rolled that out in your area about three months ago, actually.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference in price? I'm on the 500, what am I paying now?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here... You're currently at $79.99 a month, and that's actually... looks like you're in year two of a promotional rate. So the Gigabit 1 Gig would be $109.99 per month for the first 12 months, and then it goes to our standard rate of $129.99 after that.

Customer: Hmm, okay. That's a pretty big jump. What if I... is there any way to lock in a rate, or do you have any promotions running?

Agent: Great question. Let me check what I can do for you here. (pause, typing sounds) So normally our standard promotional period is 12 months, but because you've been a loyal customer—I'm seeing you've been with us for about four years now—I can actually bump that to 18 months at the promotional rate of $109.99. And then after that, it would go to $129.99.

Customer: (pause) Eighteen months is better. But I'm still... I mean, it's still a pretty significant increase. What about the 750 meg plan? Is that available?

Agent: That's a good question. Unfortunately, we don't have a 750 meg tier. We actually go from 500 megs up to 1 gig. But I will say, for what you're describing—the video conferencing, the large file uploads, multiple users—you're probably gonna find that 500 is gonna bottleneck you during peak usage times. The jump to 1 gig is really gonna future-proof you.

Customer: Yeah, I mean... I get that. Can I think about it?

Agent: Absolutely, take your time. But let me just sweeten the deal a little bit here. (typing sounds) I can also waive the installation fee, which would normally be $99.99. So you'd save that upfront, and you'd get those extra 18 months locked in. But I can only hold that offer for... (pause) ...let me see... I can hold it through the end of this week, so through Friday.

Customer: Oh, okay. So Friday's the deadline?

Agent: That's right. Friday of this week.

Customer: And that includes the waived installation fee and the 18-month rate?

Agent: Exactly. (typing sounds) I can even email you a summary of the offer right now so you have all the details in writing. What email would be best?

Customer: It's sarah.martinez at gmail, no spaces, dot com.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Sending that over now. You should see it in the next minute or so. Is there anything else I can answer for you about the service itself? Any questions about the speeds or how it would work in your situation?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's pretty clear. If I decide to go ahead with it, I just call back?

Agent: You got it. Just call us back, ask for the internet upgrade department, and reference the offer I just sent you. Or honestly, you can just mention that you already have the promotional offer in your email, and they can get you all set up.

Customer: Great. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. Thanks so much for being a Frontier customer, and I hope you'll decide to upgrade with us. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
