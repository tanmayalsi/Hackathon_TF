# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I'd like to look into upgrading my internet service. I've been a customer for about three years now and my current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Great, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me just pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing your account here. You're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. We're paying, what, around sixty-five a month?

Agent: (typing sounds) That's correct, sixty-four ninety-nine actually. So what's prompting the upgrade today? Are you having any issues with your current speed?

Customer: Well, not issues exactly, but my kids are doing remote learning now and my wife works from home, and when they're both online with their video calls and I'm trying to stream... it just gets really slow and stuttery. We're constantly kicking each other off, you know?

Agent: Oh yeah, I definitely understand. Hundred megabits is fine for lighter usage, but yeah, with multiple video streams and everything else going on, that can definitely cause some congestion. (pause) So we have a couple of options for you. We offer Fiber 300, which is our most popular plan, and then we also have Fiber 500 if you really want the premium speeds.

Customer: What's the difference in price between those?

Agent: Good question. So your Fiber 100 is sixty-four ninety-nine. The Fiber 300 would be... (typing sounds) eighty-nine ninety-nine per month, and the Fiber 500 is one twenty-nine ninety-nine.

Customer: Wow, okay. So almost double for the 300?

Agent: Yeah, I know it seems like a jump, but you're actually tripling your speed, so you'd go from 100 megabits per second to 300, and the 500 plan would get you up to 500 megabits per second. For what you're describing with multiple video calls at once, honestly, the 300 plan should be plenty. That's usually our sweet spot for households with three to four people working or learning from home simultaneously.

Customer: (pause) And there's no promotion or anything? Like a new customer rate?

Agent: (typing sounds) That's a great question. Actually, we do have an offer right now. I can get you on the Fiber 300 plan for seventy-nine ninety-nine for the first twelve months, and then it goes to the regular rate after that.

Customer: Oh, so that's better. (pause) And what about installation? Do I need a technician to come out?

Agent: So, good news there. Since you're already an existing Fiber customer, we can actually do a remote provisioning upgrade. What that means is we can update your modem and activate the higher speeds from our end, so no technician visit needed. You'd just need to restart your modem and you're all set. It usually takes about ten minutes.

Customer: Oh, that's convenient. (pause) Okay, and if I do this, I'm not locked into another contract or anything, right?

Agent: No, you're not. We don't have contracts on our residential internet plans. You're month-to-month, so you have the flexibility to change or cancel whenever you need to.

Customer: Alright, I think... I think I want to go with the 300 plan then. That promotional rate for the first year sounds good.

Agent: Excellent choice. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to make that change to your account right now. I'm upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300 at seventy-nine ninety-nine per month for the first twelve months. (pause) (typing sounds) Great, and this is effective immediately. You should restart your modem sometime tonight or whenever you get a chance. I'd recommend unplugging it for about thirty seconds, then plugging it back in.

Customer: Got it. Will my internet go down when I do that?

Agent: You'll lose internet for just a few minutes while it boots back up and reconnects to our network. So just give it a few minutes and you should be good to go.

Customer: Okay, perfect. Um, is there anything else I should know?

Agent: (pause) Let me see here... (typing sounds) No, I think we're all set. You should see a significant speed improvement once that's provisioned. If for some reason you don't notice a difference after a day or two, just give us a call back and we can troubleshoot. But with the upgrade, you should be golden. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you so much, Marcus. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
