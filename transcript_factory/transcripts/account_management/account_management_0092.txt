Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on the 500 megabit plan, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore. I've been working from home a lot more, and my internet has been getting pretty sluggish when my partner is also online. I'm thinking I need to upgrade.

Agent: I completely understand. Working from home definitely puts more demand on your connection. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this still the address on file? 4829 Maple Drive in Portland?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So you're on our 500 meg plan right now, which is a solid speed, but I hear you. A lot of our customers working from home are finding that our 1 gigabit plan works much better, especially with multiple users. Have you heard about that tier?

Customer: Yeah, I've seen it advertised. How much more is that gonna run me monthly?

Agent: (pause) So right now you're at... let me see... $79.99 a month for the 500 meg plan. Our 1 gig plan is $109.99 per month. So that's an increase of $30.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) That's a bit steep. How much faster is it really? Like, what's the actual difference I'd notice?

Agent: That's a great question. So the 1 gig plan—that's one gigabit per second—is twice as fast as your current plan. In practical terms, if you're uploading files for work, that'll be noticeably quicker. Video conferencing will be more stable when multiple people are on your network. And if you're downloading large files, we're talking about significantly faster times. The real benefit is bandwidth headroom. You won't get those slowdowns when your partner jumps on.

Customer: Okay, that actually makes sense. Um, what about installation? Would I need someone to come out, or can you just flip a switch or whatever?

Agent: (slight laugh) I wish it was that easy sometimes. Since you're already a Fiber customer at your address, and we already have the infrastructure in place, it should be a remote provisioning. Basically, we push an update through your modem, and boom—you're good to go. It typically takes effect within 24 hours. No technician visit necessary.

Customer: Oh, that's awesome. That's perfect actually. I don't really want anyone in the house right now, so...

Agent: I totally get it. So we can get you scheduled for that update pretty much whenever. The good news is there's zero downtime or anything like that. What I can do is I can go ahead and upgrade you to the 1 gig plan today, and we can set it for... when would work best for you? Tonight? Tomorrow morning?

Customer: Tonight would be great, actually. Sooner the better.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm gonna set that provisioning for... let's say 11 PM tonight. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, 11 PM is fine. I'll probably be in bed, but that's alright.

Agent: Great. So I'm just gonna confirm the details here before we finalize. You'll be going from our 500 megabit plan at $79.99 to our 1 gigabit plan at $109.99. Your service address is 4829 Maple Drive. And the provisioning will happen tonight at 11 PM. Is that all correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct. One question though—is there any kind of, like, promotion or discount you can offer on this? I've been a customer for... I think it's been three years now?

Agent: (pause) That's a great question. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) You know what, because you've been such a loyal customer, I can actually apply a three-month promotional credit of $15 per month. So that would bring your rate down to $94.99 for the first three months, and then it goes to the regular $109.99 after that.

Customer: Oh, nice! Okay, yeah, that makes it much more reasonable. I'll take it.

Agent: Awesome. I'm gonna add that to your account right now. (typing sounds) Alright, that's all set. So just to recap one more time—you've got the upgrade happening at 11 PM tonight, the promotional pricing is active, and you should see the speed improvements as soon as the update completes, usually within a few hours after that.

Customer: Perfect. Do I need to do anything on my end? Like restart my modem or anything?

Agent: Great question. You don't need to do anything. The system will handle it automatically. Your modem might blink a few times or restart on its own, but that's totally normal. Just let it do its thing. Within a few hours, you'll be all set.

Customer: Okay, cool. I think that's everything. Oh, one more thing—you'll send me confirmation of this, right? Like an email or something?

Agent: Absolutely. You'll get an email confirmation within the next few minutes, and then you'll get another notification once the upgrade is complete. You can also check your account online anytime at frontier.com with your login.

Customer: Great. Thanks so much, Derek. This was really helpful.

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Fantastic. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being such a great customer. We really appreciate your business. Have a great night!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
