Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your Frontier account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 2341 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. Okay, so I'm looking at your account here. You're currently on our Fiber 100 plan—that's 100 megabits per second download. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right. Honestly, I'm not super tech-savvy, but I know it's been pretty slow lately, especially when my wife is working from home and my kids are doing their online schooling. It just gets really laggy, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. Multiple devices streaming at the same time can definitely strain a 100 meg connection. What kind of activities are you looking to support? Are we talking video conferencing, streaming, gaming, that sort of thing?

Customer: All of the above, really. My wife does Zoom calls for her job, the kids are on Google Meet for classes, and then we like to watch Netflix in the evenings. And honestly, I'd like to be able to do some online gaming without everything grinding to a halt.

Agent: That makes sense. You know, with all that concurrent usage, I'd actually recommend looking at our Fiber 500 plan or even our Fiber 1-Gig option. The Fiber 500 gives you 500 megabits per second, and the Fiber 1-Gig is one gigabit per second. Let me just verify what's available at your address...

(pause, typing sounds)

Agent: Okay, great news—both are available in your area. So, let me break down the pricing for you. Your current plan is, let me see here... $89.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I think so. Maybe a little more with taxes and fees?

Agent: Right, exactly. So if you upgrade to the Fiber 500, that would be $119.99 per month for the first year, then $149.99 after that. And the Fiber 1-Gig would be $179.99 per month for the first year, then $199.99 after that.

Customer: (pause) Wow, okay. That's... that's quite a jump from what I'm paying now.

Agent: I know it seems like a big difference, but keep in mind you're getting five to ten times the speed. So your wife's video calls will be crystal clear, the kids won't experience any lag on their classes, and you'll have plenty of bandwidth left over for gaming or streaming. Plus, the 1-Gig plan actually comes with our premium WiFi 6 router included at no extra charge.

Customer: What's the WiFi 6? Is that... better?

Agent: Yeah, so WiFi 6 is the latest standard. It's significantly faster and more reliable than older routers, so your devices will connect better throughout your whole house. And honestly, with all the devices you have going at once, it's a really good fit.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, so what's the difference between the 500 and the 1-Gig again?

Agent: The main difference is speed. The Fiber 500 gives you 500 megabits per second, and the Fiber 1-Gig gives you 1,000 megabits per second. For your situation, with three separate users doing bandwidth-intensive activities, I'd really recommend the 500 as a minimum. That said, the 1-Gig would future-proof you for the next few years, and you'd never have to worry about congestion.

Customer: And what about installation? Do you guys charge for that?

Agent: Great question. For a fiber upgrade to an existing customer, we typically charge a one-time installation fee of $99. However, I can check if there are any current promotions. (pause, typing sounds) Actually, let me see... okay, so we do have a promotion running through the end of the month where we're waiving the installation fee for upgrades on the 500 plan or higher. So that would save you that $99.

Customer: Oh, well, that's something! So if I did the Fiber 500, it would be $119.99 a month for the first year, no installation fee?

Agent: Exactly. And then $149.99 after the first year. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?

Customer: I mean... yeah, I think so. How soon could you guys get it set up?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so we have an opening this Friday, October 18th, between 1 and 4 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: This Friday? Yeah, that should be fine. My wife might be home that day, actually, which would be helpful.

Agent: Perfect. So let me just confirm the details here. We're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500, effective this Friday. The new rate is $119.99 per month for 12 months, then $149.99 after that. Installation fee is waived. You'll receive the new WiFi 6 router as part of the installation, and a technician will come out between 1 and 4 PM on Friday, October 18th. Does all of that sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Um, do I need to do anything to prepare? Like, do I need to move anything or...?

Agent: Good thinking. The technician will need access to your equipment and to the area where your fiber line enters your home. If you have an outdoor cabinet or junction box, they'll need to access that as well. Indoors, just make sure the area around your modem and router is clear. Other than that, they'll handle most of the work.

Customer: Okay, I can do that.

Agent: Wonderful. I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all these details and a reminder for your appointment. You should receive that within the next few minutes. Is the email address we have on file still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: [inaudible] Yeah, that's still good.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, if you need to reschedule the appointment at any point, you can call us back or click the link in the confirmation email. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I'm pretty excited to actually have decent internet. (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) I'm sure your family will be thrilled too. Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You're all set!

Customer: Thanks, Marcus. Have a good one.

Agent: You too! Goodbye.
