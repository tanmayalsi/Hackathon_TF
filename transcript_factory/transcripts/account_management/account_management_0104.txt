Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan, and honestly, I'm thinking about upgrading. My household is getting a little crazy with streaming and work-from-home stuff, and I'm wondering what options you have available.

Agent: Great question. I'd be happy to help you explore those options. Just to make sure I have your account pulled up correctly, can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing here that you're Robert Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Awesome. And you mentioned you're on the 500 meg plan right now. That's a solid plan. Just out of curiosity, what's kind of driving the need to upgrade? Is it performance issues, or just more demand on your network?

Customer: No, no, it's not that there's anything wrong with it. It's just... I work from home doing video conferencing, my wife streams a lot of Netflix, and my kids are always on YouTube or gaming. We've noticed some buffering here and there, especially when we're all on at once, you know?

Agent: Oh yeah, I hear that all the time. That's actually really common in households with multiple users. So we do have a couple of options for you. We have our 1 gig plan—that's 1 gigabit per second—which is our top-tier fiber offering. We also have an 800 meg option if you want something in the middle. Have you given any thought to which direction you'd like to go?

Customer: (pause) Hmm, what's the price difference between the 800 and the gig plan?

Agent: (typing sounds) Good question. So right now, for your area, the 800 meg plan would be $89.99 a month, and that's locked in for 24 months. The 1 gig plan is running $119.99 a month for the same 24-month commitment.

Customer: Okay, so that's about thirty bucks a month more. What would the actual difference be for me? Like, would I really notice it?

Agent: That's a fair question. Honestly, for your situation with video conferencing and streaming, the 800 meg plan would probably do the trick. The 1 gig plan is really best for people who are doing heavy uploading, or if you've got like... six or seven people streaming 4K simultaneously. But with four people in the household, 800 should handle that pretty comfortably without any buffering.

Customer: Yeah, that makes sense. What about equipment? Would I need a new modem or router or anything?

Agent: (pause) Let me check your current setup here. (typing sounds) You've got our Frontier WiFi 6 modem-router combo, which is actually really solid and works great with both of those plans. So no, you wouldn't need new equipment. You'd just be upgrading your service tier, and it would kick in pretty much immediately.

Customer: Okay, that's convenient. And what about the installation? Would I have to be home for anything?

Agent: Nope, not for an upgrade like this. Since you already have fiber to your home, we don't need to send a technician out. The upgrade happens on our end, and you should see the faster speeds within 24 hours or so.

Customer: Oh nice, that's easy. Um, one more thing—is there any kind of promotional pricing or anything like that? I feel like I've been a customer for a few years now.

Agent: (pause) Let me take a look at what I can do for you here. (typing sounds) So... okay, I do have a loyalty offer I can apply. I can do the 800 meg plan for $79.99 a month for the first twelve months, and then it goes to $89.99 after that. And that's still on the 24-month contract.

Customer: Oh, that's better! (laughs) I appreciate that. Yeah, let's go with the 800 meg plan then.

Agent: Perfect. I think that's a really solid choice for your household. So just to recap—we're upgrading you from the 500 meg plan to our 800 meg plan. You'll get $79.99 per month for the first twelve months, then $89.99 thereafter, locked in for 24 months. No new equipment needed, and the upgrade will be live within 24 hours. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Do I need to do anything on my end, or...?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. I'm going to go ahead and process this right now. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm just submitting the order... and... there we go. You should get a confirmation email within the next few minutes. And you can also log into your Frontier account online anytime to track the upgrade status.

Customer: Great, thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. And just a heads up—if you notice anything unusual or if the speeds don't seem to jump up after 24 hours, don't hesitate to give us a call back, okay? We're here 24/7.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again, Derek.

Agent: You got it, Robert. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and have a great day.

Customer: You too, take care.

Agent: Bye now.
