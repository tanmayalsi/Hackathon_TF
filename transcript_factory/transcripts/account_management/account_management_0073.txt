Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with your service, but I'm thinking I need to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: That's great to hear you've been happy with us! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... and I'm looking at your account now. So you're currently on our 200 megabit per second plan. What's prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, or...?

Customer: Yeah, actually, I started working from home about six months ago, and my roommate streams a lot, so when we're both online it just gets really slow. Video calls get choppy, and it's kind of frustrating.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. That can definitely be annoying. (pause) So with multiple devices going at once, you're probably hitting that bandwidth ceiling pretty quickly. Let me see what we have available in your area. (typing sounds) Perfect. We can upgrade you to either our 400 meg plan or... we also have our gig plan, which is a thousand megs per second. That one's pretty popular with people who work from home.

Customer: Okay, and what would those cost me? I'm currently paying... I think it's like $79 a month?

Agent: Let me check your current rate here. Yes, you're at $79.99 for the 200 meg plan. So if you upgrade to our 400 meg, that would be $99.99 per month. And the gig plan is $129.99 per month. Both of those are for the first twelve months, and then rates do adjust after that.

Customer: Hmm. And is there any difference in equipment? Like, would I need a new router or anything?

Agent: That's a smart question. (pause) So the good news is your current equipment should be compatible with the 400 meg upgrade without any issues. However, if you go with the gig plan, I would recommend upgrading to one of our newer WiFi 6 routers. That's really optimized for those higher speeds. The rental fee for that is about $15 a month, but honestly, the difference in performance is pretty noticeable.

Customer: So that would be $145 for the gig plan with the router?

Agent: Correct, yes. $129.99 for the service plus the $15 router rental. Although, um, let me see if there's any promotions running right now... (typing sounds, pause) You know what, because you've been such a loyal customer for three years, I can actually waive the first three months of the router rental fee. So you'd be looking at $129.99 for the first quarter, and then $144.99 after that.

Customer: Oh, that's nice! That's actually pretty helpful. I think I want to go with the gig plan then. I'd rather have the speed and not have to worry about it down the line.

Agent: Excellent choice. I think you're going to be really happy with that. (typing sounds) So let me just confirm the details here. We're upgrading you from the 200 meg plan to our gigabit plan with the WiFi 6 router, router fee waived for three months. The installation... (pause) looks like we can get a technician out to you on Saturday between 8 AM and noon. Does that work?

Customer: This Saturday? Oh, that's sooner than I expected. Um, yeah, that should be fine. That works for me.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, the technician will come out and just make sure everything's properly configured for the new speeds. It shouldn't take more than about 30 minutes. Will you be home at that time?

Customer: Yeah, I'll make sure I'm there. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Nope, nothing on your end. Just make sure you have access to your modem and router if possible, but honestly, the technician will handle everything. Um, one thing—we will need to do a brief service interruption during that time, probably 15 to 20 minutes max, while we're provisioning everything on our end. So don't be alarmed if your internet drops for a bit.

Customer: Okay, got it. That's fine.

Agent: (typing sounds) And I'm going to email you a confirmation of all of this—the new plan details, the appointment information, and then you'll also receive a text message reminder on Saturday morning. Is the email on file still good? Should be [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And your phone number for the text reminder?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) So just to recap everything—you're upgrading to our gigabit service at $129.99 a month with a complimentary WiFi 6 router for the first three months, then $144.99 after. Your appointment is this Saturday between 8 AM and noon, and you'll get confirmation and a reminder. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much, Marcus. I appreciate the help and especially that discount on the router.

Agent: You're very welcome! We really appreciate your business, and I think you're going to love those speeds. If you have any issues after the installation or if you need anything else, just give us a call back. Thanks for choosing Frontier!

Customer: Thanks, have a good one.

Agent: You too, take care!
