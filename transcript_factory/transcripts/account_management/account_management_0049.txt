Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet plan. My speeds have been pretty slow lately.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm seeing your account here. So you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I mean, it's been okay, but I'm working from home now and I'm constantly in Zoom calls and downloading files. A hundred megs just doesn't cut it anymore, you know?

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. Working from home definitely requires more bandwidth. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking at? We have a few options available in your area.

Customer: I have no idea, honestly. What would you recommend? Like, what's the next step up?

Agent: Well, so we have our Fiber 300 plan, which gives you 300 megabits per second download and 300 upload. That's actually our most popular plan for people working from home. Then we also have our Fiber 500 and Fiber Gig plans if you want to go even higher.

Customer: Okay, um... what's the price difference? I mean, I don't want to go overboard, but I also want something that's actually going to work.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, so your current plan is $64.99 a month. If you upgrade to the Fiber 300, that would be $84.99 a month. So just a twenty dollar increase.

Customer: And that's gonna be noticeably faster?

Agent: Oh yeah, absolutely. You'll have three times the speed, so your downloads will be significantly faster, and your upload speeds are really where you'll see the difference in those Zoom calls. Plus, with multiple devices on your network, you'll have plenty of bandwidth to spare.

Customer: Okay, that sounds pretty good. What about the Fiber 500? How much is that?

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) The Fiber 500 is $114.99 a month. So about thirty dollars more than what you're paying now. But honestly, for most home office situations, the 300 is more than enough. The 500 is great if you're doing heavy video editing or if you have multiple people streaming and working simultaneously.

Customer: Right, yeah, no, just me working from home. The 300 sounds like it'll do the trick. How quickly can you switch me over?

Agent: Perfect choice. (typing sounds) So the upgrade can take effect as soon as tomorrow. You shouldn't need any new equipment or anything like that—your current modem is compatible with the faster speeds. You'll just see it kick in once the changes are processed on our end.

Customer: Oh, that's great. That's a lot easier than I thought it was gonna be.

Agent: Yeah, we try to make it seamless. (pause) Now, since you're upgrading, I do have a promotional offer available. We can give you the first month of the Fiber 300 plan at just $49.99 instead of the regular $84.99. That's about forty percent off.

Customer: Wait, really? That's awesome.

Agent: Yeah, it's a nice little welcome bonus for upgrading. And then it'll go to the regular $84.99 starting in month two. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, absolutely. Let's do it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Awesome. So I'm gonna go ahead and process this upgrade for you. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, and I'm gonna need to confirm a couple things. Your billing address is still 447 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: And your email is still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, so you're all set. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details of your upgrade. Your new plan takes effect tomorrow at midnight. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks a lot, Derek. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and enjoy those faster speeds. If you have any issues or questions, feel free to give us a call back anytime. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
