# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um... I'm calling because I'd like to upgrade my internet service. I've had Frontier for about three years now, and honestly, my current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Before we get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 2341 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. One hundred megabits per second, I think?

Agent: Exactly. And can I ask what's prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, streaming, or...?

Customer: All of the above, honestly. I got a new job last month where I work from home three days a week, and my wife and I have been watching a lot more Netflix and stuff. Plus, we just added a couple of smart home devices, and when my kids are gaming online at the same time... it just gets really slow. Pages take forever to load sometimes.

Agent: I totally understand. Those bandwidth demands add up quick, especially with multiple devices. (pause) Looking at your address, you're in a great service area for our upgrades. I've got a couple of options for you. We have our Fiber 300 plan at $79.99 a month, which would give you three hundred megs per second, and then our Fiber 500 plan at $99.99 a month for five hundred megs per second. Both are significant jumps from where you are now.

Customer: Hmm, what's the difference between those two, really? Like, would I notice it in everyday use?

Agent: That's a great question. For most households, the 300 plan handles multiple streams, work-from-home video calls, and gaming really well without much issue. The 500 plan is more future-proof if you think your household usage is going to keep growing. It's also better if you're streaming in 4K or if you have multiple people doing demanding tasks simultaneously.

Customer: How much more expensive is it? The 500, I mean.

Agent: It's just twenty dollars more per month, so $99.99 versus the $79.99 for the 300. Over a year, that's two hundred and forty dollars difference.

Customer: (pause) You know what, I think the 500 makes sense. Better to have it and not need it, right?

Agent: I think that's a smart call, honestly. Especially with your situation. Let me just verify a couple of things real quick. Your current service... when was the last time we did any work at your address? Any equipment upgrades or anything?

Customer: Oh, um... I'm not sure. Probably when they first installed it, years ago?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful to know. Most likely, we'll need to send a technician out to upgrade your equipment—your modem and router—to support those higher speeds. It's pretty quick, usually takes about an hour or so. Would you be available for a technician visit sometime this week?

Customer: This week? Yeah, I mean... what days are we talking?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability. We've got openings tomorrow between 9 AM and noon, or Thursday afternoon between 1 and 4 PM, or Friday morning between 8 and 11 AM.

Customer: Tomorrow won't work. Friday morning would be perfect, actually.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule that for Friday, May 17th, between 8 and 11 AM. (pause) And just to set expectations—the technician will bring the new equipment, get everything connected and tested. You should be online with your new speeds pretty quickly after they leave.

Customer: Great. And I'm not going to get charged an installation fee or anything, right?

Agent: (brief pause) So, we don't charge for the equipment upgrade since you're an existing customer. However, there would be a $99 installation fee for the technician visit. But—let me see what I can do for you here. (typing sounds) You know what, I'm going to waive that for you as a courtesy, since you've been with us for three years. How's that?

Customer: Oh wow, that's really nice of you. Thank you!

Agent: You're welcome. Okay, so to recap: we're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500. Your new rate is going to be $99.99 per month—there's a two-year rate guarantee on that price. The technician will be out Friday morning, and the installation fee is waived. You should see the changes reflected on your next billing cycle.

Customer: That sounds good. What about my current equipment? Do I need to do anything with it?

Agent: The technician will take care of that. They'll just swap it out with the new modem and router. No need to do anything on your end.

Customer: Perfect. Um, one more thing—if I'm not happy with it or if something doesn't work out, what's the process to change it back or...?

Agent: Good question. You'd have a thirty-day window from the upgrade date to try it out. If for some reason you want to go back to your old plan, you can just give us a call and we'll process that for you, no penalty or anything. But I think you're going to be really happy with the improvement, honestly.

Customer: Okay, that's reassuring. I think we're good then.

Agent: Awesome. Let me just make sure we have the right number to confirm your appointment. Is 555-0392 the best number to reach you on Friday morning?

Customer: Actually, make it 555-0185. That's my cell.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. I'm sending you a confirmation email right now to the address on file, and we're also going to send you a text message with the appointment details. If you need to reschedule for any reason, you can call us back or you can click the link in the text.

Customer: Perfect. That's great.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks so much, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. I appreciate your business, and thank you for choosing Frontier. Have a great day, and we'll see you Friday morning!

Customer: Thanks. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
