Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm thinking it might be time to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've actually upgraded our fiber network in a lot of areas, so you might have some great options available. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Okay, so I'm seeing here that you're currently on our 100 megabit per second plan. Is that still the package you're on?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine for a while, but my wife and I are both working from home now, and we've got our daughter doing school online too. So when everyone's on video calls at the same time, things just get really laggy and slow.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, I hear that a lot these days. Multiple video conferences definitely eat up that bandwidth. The good news is we have some excellent options for you. What we typically recommend for that situation is our 400 meg package, or if you want to go all out, we just rolled out gig service in your area—that's one gigabit per second.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference in price between what I'm paying now and those options?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me check your current rate. So you're at $59.99 a month for the 100 meg plan. Our 400 meg package is $79.99 a month, so that's an extra $20. And our gig service is $99.99 per month, which would be $40 more than what you're currently paying.

Customer: Hmm, and is there any setup fee or anything like that?

Agent: Great question. So for upgrades, we typically waive the installation fee. You would just need a technician to come out and swap out your modem for a newer one that's compatible with the higher speeds. That visit is completely free. The only thing you might see is a small equipment fee of around $15 a month if you want to rent the newer modem, but a lot of customers choose to purchase it outright for about $120.

Customer: Wait, so I'd have to buy the modem?

Agent: You have the option to either rent or purchase. If you rent, it's $15 a month, but over time that adds up. If you buy it for the $120 upfront cost, then you own it and there's no monthly fee after that. Most of our customers break even within about eight months, so it usually makes sense to purchase.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that actually does make sense. Okay, so let me ask you this—how much faster would the gig service actually be compared to the 400 meg?

Agent: So the gig would be about two and a half times faster than the 400. Honestly, for a household with multiple video conferences and streaming, the 400 meg is usually more than sufficient. The gig is great if you're doing a lot of large file uploads, running a business from home with heavy data needs, or if you just want the absolute best performance. But for most families, the 400 is really the sweet spot for value.

Customer: Okay, and how long would this take to set up? Because we'd need to schedule that around our work schedules.

Agent: (typing sounds) So typically our earliest available appointment is... let me see... we have Thursday of next week, either morning between 8 AM and noon, or afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Or I can look at the following week if neither of those work.

Customer: Thursday morning would be perfect. Can you make that happen?

Agent: Absolutely, I can get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) So just to confirm, you want to upgrade to the 400 megabit plan at $79.99 a month, and you're going to purchase the modem for the one-time fee of $120, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. And will there be any contract or anything? Like, am I locked in for a certain amount of time?

Agent: That's a good question. We do ask for a one-year service agreement for the promotional rate. After that year, you can either keep the service at the standard rate or you're free to cancel without penalty.

Customer: Okay, I think I'm good with that. Let's do it.

Agent: Excellent! (typing sounds) Alright, I'm setting up your appointment for Thursday, December 14th between 8 and noon. A technician will come out and get you all set up. You should see the speed increase take effect that same day once we activate the service. (pause) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. When will I see the change on my bill?

Agent: The new rate will show up on your next billing cycle. So when's your current bill date?

Customer: I think it's around the 20th of the month.

Agent: Okay, so the rate change will appear on your December 20th bill. And you should receive a confirmation email shortly with all these details and your appointment information. Do you have the best email on file, or should I update that?

Customer: The email should be good. I think you guys have my current one.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you so much for choosing to upgrade with Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's great. Thanks Marcus, I appreciate your help.

Agent: You're very welcome! Have a great day, and we'll see you Thursday morning!

Customer: You too, bye!

Agent: Bye now! (call ends)
