# Frontier Communications - Service Upgrade Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've had Frontier for about three years now, and honestly, my speeds have been pretty slow lately.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your phone number or account number?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. I think I pay like... seventy-five dollars a month or something?

Agent: That's exactly right—$74.99. And you're saying you've been experiencing slower speeds than usual?

Customer: Yeah, like, it's frustrating. My roommate and I are both working from home, and when he's on a video call and I'm trying to upload files, everything just crawls. I figured I should just bite the bullet and get a faster plan.

Agent: That makes total sense. That's a pretty common issue with multiple users on the same connection. The good news is we have some great options for you. (pause) Let me tell you what we have available in your area. You can upgrade to our Fiber 300 plan, which is three times faster than what you have now, or we also offer Fiber 500 if you want maximum speeds.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference in price?

Agent: (typing sounds) So the Fiber 300 is $99.99 per month, and the Fiber 500 is $129.99. Now, I should mention—are you still within your service agreement, or is it coming up?

Customer: Um, I'm not totally sure. I've been with you guys for a while though.

Agent: (typing) Okay, let me check that. (pause) Great news—looks like your agreement ended about eight months ago, so you're completely clear to upgrade without any penalties or anything like that.

Customer: Oh, that's good. Um... (pause) what about the 300? How much faster is that really going to be?

Agent: So with the Fiber 300, you'd be getting 300 megabits per second download speeds, compared to your current 100. Most people find that with two people working from home, that's plenty of bandwidth. Video calls stay crystal clear, file uploads happen way faster. The 500 is overkill for most households unless you've got like four or more people streaming 4K video simultaneously, you know?

Customer: Yeah, okay, that sounds... I think 300 would probably be good for us. How much more am I actually paying? Like, what's the difference month to month?

Agent: So you'd be looking at an increase of $25 per month, so $99.99 total instead of $74.99. But here's the thing—I can actually apply a promotional discount for you right now since you've been such a loyal customer. I can get you that Fiber 300 for $84.99 for the first twelve months.

Customer: Really? Oh, wow, okay, that's actually... that's pretty reasonable.

Agent: Yeah, it's a nice savings. And after the promotional period, it would go to the regular $99.99, but you'd have twelve months to see if you like the speeds. You can always call back if you want to adjust.

Customer: Okay, cool. Um, do I need to do anything with like, equipment or anything? Will I need a new modem?

Agent: (typing sounds) Good question. Let me see what modem you currently have... (pause) You've got our standard model, and actually, you know what, that one will be totally compatible with the faster speeds. No equipment changes needed. You'd literally just see the upgrade take effect within 24 hours.

Customer: That's easy then. Yeah, let's do it.

Agent: Awesome! Let me just verify a few things here, and then we'll get you all set. (pause) So just to confirm, you want to upgrade from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300 with the promotional rate of $84.99 per month for the first year, then $99.99 after that?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And your service address is still 447 Maple Street, Apartment 2B?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. (pause) Okay, I'm processing this change right now. (pause) [inaudible] system here... (pause) You know what, just give me one second. Let me make sure the promotional code goes through... (pause) Perfect. You're all set. Your upgrade is confirmed and will be activated tomorrow morning by around 9 AM. You should see those faster speeds right away.

Customer: Wonderful. Do I need to do anything on my end?

Agent: Nope, nothing at all. You might want to restart your modem sometime tomorrow just to refresh the connection, but honestly, you might not even need to. You'll probably just notice things loading faster when you wake up.

Customer: That's great. Um, is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Just that your new bill will reflect the change starting with your next billing cycle. You'll get an email confirmation of this upgrade—I'm sending that to you right now—and if you ever have any questions, you can reach us at the number on your bill. We also have 24/7 chat support on our website.

Customer: Perfect. That's really helpful, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: Of course! Thank you so much for choosing to upgrade with Frontier. We really appreciate your loyalty, and I'm sure you're going to be really happy with those faster speeds. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day, and thanks again for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
