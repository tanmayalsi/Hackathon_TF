Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, so I'm currently a customer with you guys and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service address at 2841 Maple Drive in the Cedar Rapids area?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Great. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing here that you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. That's our one-hundred-megabit package. Is that correct?

Customer: Uh-huh, yeah. I've had that for like... I don't know, three years maybe? And it was fine at first, but now with working from home and my kids doing school online, it just feels slow. Netflix keeps buffering, and downloads take forever.

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually a really common situation we're hearing about lately, especially with more people working remotely. The good news is you're in one of our fiber service areas, so we have some really solid options for you. 

Customer: Okay, cool.

Agent: So what we have available at your address are our Fiber 300, which is three hundred megabits, our Fiber 500, and our Fiber Gig service, which is one gigabit per second. Have you thought about which speed might work best for you?

Customer: Um, well, what's the difference in price? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (typing sounds) Totally fair question. So your current plan is $59.99 a month for the first year, then it goes up to $79.99. Our Fiber 300 would be $79.99 for the first twelve months, then $99.99 after that. The 500 meg plan is $99.99 for year one, and $119.99 going forward.

Customer: Wow, okay. That's... (pause) that's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. What about that gigabit one you mentioned?

Agent: The Fiber Gig is $129.99 for the promotional period, then $149.99 after that. Now, I know that sounds like a jump, but honestly, for a household with multiple people streaming and working online simultaneously, the 500 or the Gig would really make a huge difference in your experience.

Customer: Yeah, I hear what you're saying. Can you... I mean, is there any way you could do a better deal? Like, do you have any promotions running right now?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what I can do here. (pause) Okay, so because you're an existing customer and you've been loyal to us for three years, I can actually waive the installation fee for you, which is usually $99. That'll save you there. And... (pause) let me check my promotion codes... I can get you on the Fiber 500 plan at $89.99 for the first twelve months instead of $99.99, which gets you ten bucks off the regular promotional rate.

Customer: Okay, that's a little better. But I'm still gonna go from sixty bucks to ninety bucks a month. That's like... that's a pretty big jump.

Agent: I understand your concern. But I'd really encourage you to think about the value you're getting. With Fiber 500, you'd be going from 100 megs to 500 megs—that's five times the speed. With multiple devices and people online, you'd really notice that improvement. No more buffering, faster downloads, better video calls for work... It'd probably change your whole experience.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. When you put it that way... I mean, I work in IT, so I know bandwidth matters. But I just wanted to make sure I wasn't overpaying.

Agent: No, that makes total sense. And you're not—this is actually a really competitive rate for the speeds you'd be getting. Plus, we have no data caps on our fiber plans, so you don't have to worry about overage charges or anything like that.

Customer: Oh, that's good to know. Alright, let's do the 500 plan. When could you get that installed?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great choice! So let me just verify—you want to upgrade to Fiber 500 at $89.99 per month for the first year, with the installation fee waived. We'd keep your same modem and router setup since those are compatible. 

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Okay, so for installation, we have availability next Thursday, the 14th, between 9 AM and 1 PM, or we also have Friday the 15th in the afternoon, 1 to 5 PM window. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Uh, Thursday morning would be better. I'm usually out on Fridays.

Agent: Excellent. Thursday the 14th, 9 to 1 PM window. Let me just get a contact number to confirm the appointment. Is 555-0147 still the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. And just to set expectations, the technician will come out, verify that your line is optimized for the higher speeds, and make sure everything is running smoothly. It typically takes about an hour. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Oh wait—when does this plan start?

Agent: Your service will switch over tomorrow at midnight, so you'll see the speed improvement starting Friday morning. The installation appointment on Thursday is really just to make sure everything's configured optimally and to answer any questions you might have.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks so much for helping me with that.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details about your upgrade and your appointment. If you have any questions, you can always call us back or check your account online.

Customer: Awesome. Have a good one.

Agent: You too! Thanks for calling Frontier.
