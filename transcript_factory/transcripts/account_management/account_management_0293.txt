Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan and I'm thinking about upgrading to something faster. My household is getting bigger and we're all working from home now, so we need more speed.

Agent: Oh, absolutely. I completely understand. More people at home definitely means you're gonna want that extra bandwidth. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing) Okay, got it here. So I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years on that 500 meg plan. That's great. And just so I understand your situation better—you said your household is getting bigger? Are you expecting more people working from home simultaneously, or is it more about streaming and gaming as well?

Customer: All of the above, honestly. I've got two kids doing remote school now, my wife and I are both doing video calls constantly for work, and my son likes to stream movies and play online games. It's just... everything slows down when we're all on at the same time, you know?

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. Video conferencing, streaming, and gaming—those are all bandwidth hogs. So with your current 500 megs, you're probably hitting some real bottlenecks during peak hours. The good news is we have some really solid options for you. (pause) Let me see what we have available at your address.

Customer: Great, yeah. What would you recommend?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so in your area we can offer you our 1 gigabit fiber service. That's gonna be ten times faster than what you're on now, so it should handle everything you're throwing at it without any issues. We also have a 2 gig option if you really want to future-proof yourself, but for most households in your situation, the 1 gig is gonna be more than enough.

Customer: Wow, okay. And what's the difference in price between those two?

Agent: Good question. So your current 500 meg plan is... let me see here... you're at $79.99 a month. Our 1 gig fiber would be $99.99 a month. And then the 2 gig option is $149.99 monthly.

Customer: Hmm, okay. And do I need new equipment for the upgrade?

Agent: That's actually a great question. With the gigabit plan, we would need to install a new fiber modem and router. The installation would be free, and we'd schedule a technician to come out. Takes about an hour or so. You wouldn't have any charges for the equipment either—it's all included.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad. And how soon could someone come out?

Agent: (typing) Let me check our tech schedule. We're looking at... do you prefer a weekday or weekend appointment?

Customer: Um, probably a weekend would be better. Maybe Saturday?

Agent: (typing) Okay, I'm seeing availability this Saturday between 8 AM and noon, or we've got afternoon slots between 1 and 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Saturday afternoon would be perfect. Like 2 to 3 PM area?

Agent: (typing) Perfect, I can get you locked in for 1 to 5 PM on Saturday, May 18th. The tech will text you an hour before they arrive to narrow down the window. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's great. So just to make sure I understand—I'd be upgrading to the 1 gig plan at $99.99 a month, and a tech comes out Saturday to install the new equipment. What about my current modem and router? Do I need to return those?

Agent: Great question. Yes, you would return your current equipment. The tech can actually take those with them on Saturday when they do the install, so you don't have to worry about shipping anything back.

Customer: Oh perfect. And is there any promotional pricing or anything like that? I've been a customer for a few years...

Agent: (pause) You know what, let me check what loyalty offers we have available. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that we can offer you... three months at a promotional rate of $79.99 for the 1 gig plan. So basically you'd get the upgrade but keep your current price for the first three months, then it goes to the regular $99.99 after that. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh, that's really good! Yeah, I appreciate that. Let's do it.

Agent: Awesome! Perfect. So let me just confirm everything here. You're upgrading from your current 500 meg plan to our 1 gigabit fiber service. You'll get three months at $79.99, then $99.99 monthly after that. Installation is this Saturday, May 18th between 1 and 5 PM. The tech will swap out your modem and router at no charge, and you can turn in your old equipment at that time. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect, Derek.

Agent: Great! I'm gonna send a confirmation email to the address we have on file. Can you just verify that's still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Actually, it's [inaudible]@outlook.com.

Agent: (typing) Got it, let me update that. Outlook, got it. You should receive that confirmation within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for the help, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your loyalty over these past three years. You're gonna love that gigabit speed. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too!

Agent: Bye now.
