Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've had the same plan for like three years and my speeds are just... they're not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've made a lot of improvements to our network, so you're definitely going to see some better options available now. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to verify, is this for the address on file? 2841 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yep, that's the one.

Agent: (pause) Great, I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's it. I mean, it was fine when I first got it, but now I'm working from home a lot more, and my partner streams constantly. We're both on video calls all the time, and it just feels slow. Plus, we have like five devices connected at once... it gets pretty choppy.

Agent: Oh, that makes total sense. A hundred megs can definitely get strained in that situation. The good news is, fiber is fantastic for that kind of usage. What speeds are you looking to upgrade to? We have Fiber 300, Fiber 500, and our top tier, Fiber Gig.

Customer: What would you recommend? I don't want to overpay for something I don't need, but I also don't want to be in the same boat in another year.

Agent: That's a fair question. So, with two people working from home and heavy streaming, I'd honestly recommend our Fiber 500 plan. It gives you plenty of headroom for everything you're doing, and it's really solid for future-proofing. The Gig is incredible, but unless you're, like, backing up massive files or you really want that absolute top speed, the 500 should handle your household really well.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that sounds reasonable. How much would that run me?

Agent: (typing sounds) So, I'm looking at the promotional pricing right now. For the Fiber 500, we can get you set up at $79.99 a month for the first twelve months.

Customer: How much after that?

Agent: After the twelve-month promo period, it would be $99.99 a month for standard pricing. But honestly, we usually have promotions running, so when your year is up, you can always give us a call and we can look at what's available at that time.

Customer: And I don't have to buy any new equipment or anything?

Agent: Great question. You would need a new modem to support those speeds. The modem we'd send you is actually no charge—we cover that. It's newer equipment, and it's designed to handle the higher speeds. We'd also send you a technician to install it and make sure everything's running properly. There would be a standard installation fee of $99, but I can actually waive that for you since you're an existing customer upgrading.

Customer: Oh, that's nice of you. When could a technician come out? I'm kind of hoping for sooner rather than later.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability... (pause) Okay, so we have availability on Thursday between 2 PM and 5 PM, or we have Saturday morning from 9 AM to noon. Which works better for you?

Customer: Saturday morning is better. I can be around then.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I'm going to get you scheduled for Saturday, November 16th, between 9 and noon. And just so you have everything, you should receive a confirmation email within the next fifteen minutes or so with all your appointment details. You'll also see the new modem shipped out before then—it should arrive by Friday.

Customer: Great, I appreciate that.

Agent: Absolutely. So just to recap, we're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500 at $79.99 a month for your first year. Installation fee is waived. The technician will come out Saturday morning to set you up with the new modem. And your promotional pricing will be on your next bill. Does that all sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything.

Agent: Great. Well, thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You should see a huge difference once you get that 500 speed. Enjoy!

Customer: Thanks, I will. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
