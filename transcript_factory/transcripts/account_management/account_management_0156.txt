Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'd like to upgrade my internet service. I've been with you guys for a couple years now and my current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Before we get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing an account under Jennifer Martinez. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Jennifer! So you're looking to upgrade your service. Can you tell me a little bit about what's not working with your current plan? What speeds are you getting now, and what would you like to upgrade to?

Customer: Well, I'm currently on the 100 megabit plan, and honestly, it was fine when I got it, but now I'm working from home a lot, and my husband streams a ton of Netflix, and our kid is doing Zoom classes. It just... it buffers constantly. It's so frustrating.

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally understand. A hundred megs can definitely get stretched thin when you've got multiple people doing bandwidth-heavy stuff at the same time. (pause) Let me just confirm your address real quick. You're at 342 Oakmont Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. So the good news is that our Fiber network is available at your location, which means we have some really solid upgrade options for you. We can offer you 300 megabits per second, 500 megabits, or our top tier Gig plan at 1,000 megabits. (pause) Which of those sounds like it might work for your situation?

Customer: Wow, okay. So... what's the difference really between 300 and 500? Like, would I notice?

Agent: Great question. So the 300 meg is going to be perfect if you've got maybe two or three devices streaming at once, or video calls while someone's browsing. The 500 gets you a little more headroom, so you can handle multiple 4K streams simultaneously, and you know, just have less congestion overall. Honestly, for your situation with the remote work, the streaming, and the school calls, I'd probably recommend the 500 meg plan. It'll give you plenty of buffer room.

Customer: Okay, and what's that going to run me per month?

Agent: (typing sounds) So right now we have a promotional offer on the 500 meg plan. We can get you set up at $79.99 per month for the first 12 months. After that it goes to our standard rate of $109.99 a month.

Customer: And what am I paying now?

Agent: You're currently at $64.99 for your 100 meg plan.

Customer: (pause) So that's an increase of about fifteen bucks a month for the first year... (trailing off) What about equipment? Will I need a new modem or anything?

Agent: That's a smart question. Since you're upgrading to Fiber speeds, you will need to swap out your current equipment. We have a modem that supports those speeds, and there's actually no charge for the equipment—that's included with the service. We'll mail it out to you, or if you'd prefer, we can schedule a technician to come install it for you at no extra charge.

Customer: Oh, really? You don't charge for installation?

Agent: We do offer self-install, which is completely free. But if you want a technician to come out and make sure everything's set up perfectly, that's also free on upgrades like this. Most people appreciate having the tech handle it, especially when you're switching over from an older service.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I think I'd rather have someone come do it. When could that happen?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability in your area. (pause) Looks like we have some openings this week. We have tomorrow between 2 and 6 PM, or Thursday morning from 8 AM to noon. What works better for your schedule?

Customer: Uh, Thursday morning would be better. I'm working from home but at least that way I can get it done early and not worry about it the rest of the day.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to go ahead and schedule that for Thursday, June 15th between 8 AM and noon. You'll get an email confirmation with all the details, and the tech will text you about 30 minutes before he arrives. His name will be on there too.

Customer: Great, that sounds good.

Agent: And just so you know, during the installation, you might have a brief internet outage—usually just 15, 20 minutes while we're switching everything over. So maybe plan around that if you can.

Customer: Oh, okay. Thanks for the heads up. Um, one more question—can I lock in that $79.99 rate for longer than a year? Like, is there a contract or anything?

Agent: (pause) So the promotional pricing is locked in for 12 months. After that, the rate does go to $109.99 unless we have another promotion running at that time. We don't require a contract, so you're month-to-month after the promotional period. No early termination fees or anything like that.

Customer: Okay, that's fair. And I'll just get the one bill, right? Everything bundled together?

Agent: Yep, one bill. Very simple. (typing sounds) Alright, let me just go ahead and process this upgrade for you. I'm going to confirm: upgrading from 100 meg to 500 meg Fiber, promotional rate of $79.99 per month for 12 months, free installation scheduled for Thursday June 15th, 8 AM to noon, and we'll ship out your new modem beforehand. Is all that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's perfect.

Agent: Excellent. (pause) Okay, I'm getting an order confirmation here. Your order number is 884521. You're all set! You should receive your new modem by Wednesday, so it'll be there before the tech comes Thursday. And like I said, you'll get an email with all the confirmation details.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you so much!

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. I appreciate it.

Agent: Great! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You're going to love that faster speed. Have a wonderful day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Take care, bye!
