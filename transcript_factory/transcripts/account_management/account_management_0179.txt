# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, I'm calling because I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet service. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! I appreciate your loyalty as a long-time customer. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I've got you here. I'm seeing you're currently on our 100 Mbps Fiber plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I mean, it was fine when I first got it, but now I'm working from home more, and my wife streams a lot of Netflix in the other room. Plus, we've got like four or five devices always connected. It just feels slow.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. Yeah, those situations can definitely strain a 100 Meg connection, especially if you're video conferencing at the same time as streaming. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking to upgrade to? We have several options available.

Customer: Well, what do you recommend? I don't really want to go overboard, you know? But I want it to be noticeably faster.

Agent: That makes sense. So for your situation—working from home, multiple streaming devices—I'd recommend either our 400 Mbps plan or our 1 Gig plan. The 400 is a really solid middle ground, and honestly, it'll handle everything you just described with no problem. The 1 Gig is our top tier if you want maximum future-proofing, but... (brief pause) it might be more than you need right now.

Customer: What's the price difference?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here... Your current plan is $79.99 a month. The 400 Mbps plan would be $99.99, so that's an increase of $20 a month. And the 1 Gig is $149.99.

Customer: Whoa, okay. (pause) That's... that's a pretty big jump for the 1 Gig. I think the 400 sounds more reasonable. How long would that take to get set up?

Agent: Great choice. So the good news is, because you're already in one of our service areas and you've got Fiber already installed, we can actually have a technician out there pretty quickly. Let me check availability... (typing sounds, pause) We have openings this Saturday between 8 AM and noon, or we have Tuesday afternoon, 1 to 4 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: Saturday is probably better. My wife will be home, and I wouldn't have to take time off work.

Agent: Perfect. So that would be this Saturday, the 16th, between 8 and noon. They'll come out and upgrade your equipment—you'll get a new modem and router optimized for those higher speeds. The visit is completely free. Is there anything else I should note on your account?

Customer: Um, no, I don't think so. Oh wait—will I have any downtime? Like, will the internet go out during the upgrade?

Agent: Good question. There will be a brief interruption, maybe five to ten minutes tops, when they're switching over your connection. It's really quick though. And our technician will make sure everything's working perfectly before they leave.

Customer: Okay, that's not too bad. (pause) And this $99.99 a month—is that a promotional rate or is that my regular price?

Agent: So the $99.99 is our current standard rate for the 400 Mbps plan. There's no promotional period on this one, so that's your regular price going forward. However, because you've been with us for three years, let me just... (typing sounds) ...see if I can add a loyalty discount here. (pause) Actually, you know what, I'm able to apply a $10 monthly discount for the next 12 months. So your first year would actually be $89.99 a month, and then it goes to $99.99 after that.

Customer: Oh, hey, that's pretty cool. I appreciate that.

Agent: Absolutely. And just to confirm—your billing address is still 4821 Maple Drive, Apartment 2B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so let me go ahead and process this upgrade for you. You'll be switched to the 400 Mbps Fiber plan, effective immediately. Your first bill will reflect the new rate. And I'm getting your technician appointment locked in for Saturday, December 16th, between 8 AM and noon. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour at [inaudible] that has all the details and a direct number to reschedule if needed.

Customer: Great. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Nope, nothing on your end. Just make sure someone's home to let the technician in, and that's really it. They'll handle everything else. They'll have an ID and they'll be wearing a Frontier uniform, so you'll know who they are right away.

Customer: Sounds good. I think that's everything. Thanks for helping me out today, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! And thank you for choosing Frontier Communications. You're gonna love those speeds—I really think you'll notice a big difference right away. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Have a good one.

Agent: You too, and thanks again for being a Frontier customer. Take care now.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye.
