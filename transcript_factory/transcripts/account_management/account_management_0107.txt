# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on the 100 meg service, and honestly, I'm just not getting the speeds I need anymore. I work from home now, and my wife streams constantly, so we're looking to bump up our internet.

Agent: I completely understand. Remote work definitely demands reliable, faster speeds. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm seeing you here. You've been with us for about four years now. Great to have you as a loyal customer. And just to confirm, you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, correct?

Customer: Yep, that's the one.

Agent: Awesome. So what you're experiencing is actually pretty common. When you've got multiple devices going, especially with streaming and work-from-home usage, 100 megs can definitely feel tight. What kind of speeds are you thinking about? Have you looked at any of our plans?

Customer: Um... I mean, I'm not totally sure. What do you have available at my address? And like, what would be a good bump up from where I am now?

Agent: Great question. So let me just verify what we can offer at your location. (pause) (typing sounds) Excellent news—you're in one of our fully upgraded fiber zones. We actually have three options that would be great upgrades for your situation. We've got our Fiber 300 at 300 megabits, our Fiber 500, and our Fiber 1 gig service.

Customer: Okay, so that's like... a lot of options. What's the difference in price? Because I don't want to go crazy, you know?

Agent: (chuckles) No, I totally get it. So your current plan is $89.99 a month, right? If you move to the Fiber 300, that would be $109.99 a month. That's a $20 increase. The Fiber 500 is $134.99, so $45 more than what you're paying now. And our Fiber 1 gig is $159.99 a month.

Customer: Hmm. And I'd actually get those speeds? Like, that's not just marketing numbers, right?

Agent: (laughs) No, I appreciate the skepticism, I really do. Those are the actual speeds you'll get, assuming your equipment is compatible, which it will be. You'll want to make sure your router can handle it, though. Do you have your own router, or are you using the one we provided?

Customer: I'm pretty sure it's the one you guys gave me... I don't know, it's been sitting in the closet for a while.

Agent: Okay, so here's what I'd recommend. With the Fiber 300 or higher, you're really going to want to have a newer router to maximize those speeds. We can actually include a complimentary equipment upgrade in your service. That means we'd ship you out a new modem and router combo at no extra cost.

Customer: Oh, that's nice. So... do you think 300 megs would be enough? I mean, for like, video calls and stuff?

Agent: Absolutely. For remote work and streaming? Fiber 300 is more than solid. You're looking at, you know, multiple people doing video calls simultaneously, streaming 4K on another device—you'd be totally fine. That said, if you ever want to future-proof yourself a bit, 500 is only $25 more a month.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think 300 sounds good for now. Can we do that?

Agent: Perfect. Let me just go through the details with you, and then we'll get you all set. So you'd be upgrading to Fiber 300 at $109.99 a month. Your current plan is $89.99, so that's a $20 monthly increase. We'll waive the installation fee, which normally runs $99. And like I mentioned, we'll include the new equipment at no charge.

Customer: That's great. When could we... when could that happen?

Agent: (typing sounds) So I'm looking at our availability, and the earliest we have is this Thursday, between 12 and 4 PM, or we have Friday morning between 8 and noon. Which works better for you?

Customer: Thursday afternoon would be perfect. I'm not working that day anyway.

Agent: Excellent. So I've got you down for Thursday, 12 to 4 PM. One of our technicians will come out and install the new modem and router, and they'll run a speed test to make sure everything's running optimally. The whole thing typically takes about an hour.

Customer: Sounds good. And I don't need to do anything to prepare or anything like that?

Agent: Nope, just make sure you're home that day. Oh, and one more thing—this upgrade is good through the end of the billing year, and then it'll renew at the standard rate. You know, in case rates change or anything. But we'll let you know well in advance.

Customer: Okay. So Thursday... are you sending me any kind of confirmation?

Agent: Absolutely. We'll send you an email and a text confirmation with all the details and a tracking number for your equipment. You should get those within the next couple minutes, actually. And if you need to reschedule for any reason, just give us a call back and we can adjust it.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks, Marcus. I appreciate the help.

Agent: Hey, no problem at all. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your loyalty. You're going to love the speed upgrade. Anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day, and we'll see you Thursday!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye. (call ends)
