# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your phone number or account number, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And what name is this account under?

Customer: It's under Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. I've got your account here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 50 plan. Is that the one you have?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. We've had it for... I think about two years now? But honestly, my kids are always streaming and working from home, and my husband's been gaming a lot, and it's just been really slow lately. Like, Netflix keeps buffering, and his Zoom calls are dropping.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, I hear that all the time, especially with multiple people using the internet at once. Fiber 50 can definitely get maxed out pretty quickly in situations like that. (pause) Let me ask you a few questions so I can recommend the best option for you. How many people are typically using the internet at the same time in your household?

Customer: Usually around three or four of us. And we're all doing different things—streaming, work calls, video games...

Agent: Yeah, that's definitely putting a lot of demand on your current speeds. What's your budget looking like for an upgrade? Are you looking to stay in a certain price range, or are you open to hearing what we've got?

Customer: Well, I don't want to go crazy, but I mean, if it solves the problem, I'm willing to spend a bit more. What are my options?

Agent: Excellent. So we have a few great fiber options for you. You could go up to our Fiber 100 plan, which is double your current speed at 100 megabits per second. That's usually really solid for a household like yours. Then we also have Fiber 200, which is even faster, and... oh, actually, you're in luck—we're running a pretty great promotion right now on the 200 plan.

Customer: Oh yeah? What's the promotion?

Agent: So normally Fiber 200 runs about $89.99 a month, but we're currently offering it at $69.99 for the first twelve months, and then it goes to the regular rate after that. And if you upgrade today, we'll waive the installation fee, which saves you another $99.

Customer: Wow, that's... that's actually pretty good. So what's the difference between the 100 and the 200?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great question. The Fiber 100 is, like I said, 100 megs per second, and that's... think of it like having enough lanes on a highway for most traffic. It's solid for what you're doing. The Fiber 200 is double that—it's 200 megs per second—so it gives you a lot more headroom. Honestly, for a family your size doing gaming, streaming, and video calls all at the same time, the 200 would be more future-proof, and with the promotion, the price difference isn't huge.

Customer: Hmm, and you said there's no installation fee if I do it today?

Agent: That's right. Normally we charge $99 for installation, but I can waive that for you if you want to move forward with the upgrade today. (pause) I should also mention—how's your modem? Are you renting one from us, or do you have your own?

Customer: Oh, I think we're renting one. It's the one you guys provided when we signed up.

Agent: Okay, do you happen to know the model number, or...?

Customer: Um, no, I have no idea. It's just a white box. (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) Yeah, those descriptions don't really help much, do they? That's okay. When we schedule the installation, the tech can take a look at it and let you know if you need to upgrade to a newer modem to take full advantage of the 200 speed. They'll handle all that for you.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. So... should I do the 200?

Agent: Well, based on what you've told me about your usage, I think the 200 is going to give you a much better experience. And honestly, with the promotional pricing, it's a pretty smart move. Plus, you're getting the free installation, so you're saving money on the front end too.

Customer: Alright, let's do it. Let's upgrade to the 200.

Agent: Awesome! I'm really glad I could help. (typing sounds) Let me just get some information from you here. First, do you want to keep the same billing date, or would you like to change that?

Customer: Um, the billing date is fine. Keep it the same.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm—the service address is the same as what I have here on file? 447 Maple Street, apartment 3B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So I'm going to need to schedule the installation for you. When would be a good time? We have availability tomorrow between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., or we have some slots next Tuesday...

Customer: Tomorrow won't work for me. Can we do Tuesday? Preferably morning?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have... Okay, so I can get you in on Tuesday, March 14th between 10 a.m. and noon. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect.

Agent: Excellent. So the tech will arrive somewhere within that window. They'll call you about thirty minutes before they show up. The visit should take about an hour. They'll get you set up with the new speed and check out your modem situation, like I mentioned. And just so you know, your speeds should be noticeably faster pretty much right away once they're done.

Customer: Great. And just to be clear—I won't be paying that $99 installation fee?

Agent: That's right, it's waived. You're all set there.

Customer: Okay, awesome.

Agent: Let me just review everything for you one more time. You're upgrading from Fiber 50 to Fiber 200. Your promotional rate is $69.99 per month for the first twelve months, and then it will adjust to the regular rate. Installation is waived. Your appointment is Tuesday, March 14th between 10 and noon at 447 Maple Street, apartment 3B. And you'll receive a confirmation email and text message with all this information, plus the tech's contact details.

Customer: Sounds perfect. Thank you!

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. I'm really looking forward to the faster speeds.

Agent: I'm sure you will be! Your family's going to notice a huge difference. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you on Tuesday!

Customer: Thanks so much, Marcus. Have a great day!

Agent: You too! Take care now. (call ends)
