Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm pulling that up now. And your name is...?

Customer: It's James Chen.

Agent: Thanks, James. Okay, I'm seeing here that you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I mean, it was fine when I first got it, but my wife and I both work from home now, and we're constantly buffering. Plus our kids are always streaming stuff, so...

Agent: I completely understand. That's actually a pretty common situation we hear about, especially with multiple people on the connection. So what kind of speeds are you looking for?

Customer: I'm not really sure, to be honest. I just know 100 doesn't work anymore. What do you typically recommend?

Agent: Well, it really depends on your usage. With multiple people working from home and streaming, I'd say you're probably looking at a minimum of 300 Mbps, maybe even our 500 Mbps plan if you want some really solid headroom for everything.

Customer: Okay, and what's the price difference between those?

Agent: (pause) Let me see here. Your current plan is $65 a month for the first year, then it goes to $79. Our 300 plan would be $89 for the first year, then $99. And the 500 Mbps plan is $109 first year, then $119.

Customer: Hmm, so it's like twenty-five bucks more a month for the 300?

Agent: Right, that's for the promotional pricing. After the first year, it steps up to the regular rate. But honestly, the speeds you get are pretty substantial. We're talking about five times faster than what you have now.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean... we need it. What about the 500? How much more is that really?

Agent: Another twenty dollars on top of the 300, so $109 for that first year. But I'll be honest with you—for your situation, the 300 plan should handle everything you're doing really well. The 500 is more if you think you might add more devices or if you're into online gaming at a competitive level.

Customer: No, nothing like that. Okay, I think the 300 sounds good. Is there any kind of deal or... I don't know, can you do anything on the price?

Agent: (typing sounds) Well, I can't adjust the promotional rate itself, but I can take a look at what else we have available. Let me check if there are any bundle opportunities or loyalty discounts I can apply. (pause) Okay, so you're just on internet, correct? No TV or phone services?

Customer: Right, just internet. We have all that through other stuff.

Agent: Understood. So what I can do is... (pause) ...I do see we have a loyalty bonus available. I can add that to your account, which would give you an additional $10 off for the first six months. So instead of $89, you'd be looking at $79 for the first half year.

Customer: Oh, that's nice! (pause) Okay, yeah, let's do that. When would this upgrade happen?

Agent: Great! So typically, if you're already an existing fiber customer at that address, we can push this through pretty quickly. I'd need to schedule a technician visit to upgrade your modem to handle the higher speeds. We can typically get someone out within three to five business days. Does that work with your schedule?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine. I work from home but I can... I mean, I'd rather not have someone here too early. Can you do like afternoon? Around 1 or 2 PM?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me pull up our scheduling system. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so looking at the next few days... we have availability on Thursday between 1 and 4 PM. Would that work?

Customer: This Thursday? Yeah, that's perfect.

Agent: Excellent. I'm gonna get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you down for Thursday, December 14th between 1 and 4 PM. The technician will bring the new equipment and get you all set up. You should see the speed difference pretty much immediately.

Customer: Great, and I don't have to do anything to prepare or anything, right?

Agent: Nope, nothing on your end. Just make sure someone's home to let the technician in. They'll take care of everything else. Oh, and one more thing—just a heads up, you might experience a brief outage when they're installing the new modem, maybe five to ten minutes max. But after that you're good to go.

Customer: Okay, cool. And just to confirm, my bill goes to $79 a month for the first six months, then $99 after that?

Agent: That's correct. $79 for the first six months with the loyalty discount, then $99 after the promotional period ends. And that's for the Fiber 300 plan.

Customer: Perfect. That sounds good. Do I need to do anything else on my end or...?

Agent: You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details, including your appointment time. If you have any questions before Thursday, you can always reach us back at this number or check your online account. But I think you're all set!

Customer: Awesome, Derek. Thank you so much for your help.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and I'm sure you're gonna be really happy with those faster speeds. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Take care! (call ends)
