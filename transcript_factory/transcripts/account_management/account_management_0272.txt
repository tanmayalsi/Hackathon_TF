Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yes, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I currently have the 100 megabit plan and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, especially with my kids doing remote school and my wife working from home.

Agent: I completely understand. That's actually one of the most common reasons we hear for upgrades. Let me pull up your account here real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's the same as my cell—555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (pause, typing) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see you've been with us for about three years with the Frontier Fiber 100 plan. How's that been working for you overall?

Customer: It's been pretty good up until recently, but yeah, like I said, with everyone home now, it's just been slower. We get buffering, the video calls drop sometimes... it's frustrating.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. Multiple users and video streaming definitely add up quickly. So what we're seeing is that 100 megs probably isn't quite enough for your household anymore. Let me ask you—how many devices are typically connected at the same time? Like, are we talking laptops, phones, smart TVs?

Customer: Oh man, probably five or six things at any given time. Two laptops, couple of phones, a tablet, and usually the TV in the living room is streaming something.

Agent: (typing) Right, so with that kind of load, I'd actually recommend looking at our Frontier Fiber 400 or even the Fiber 500 plan. Those would give you a much more stable experience for that many devices. The 400 would run you about forty-nine ninety-nine a month for the first year, and then it goes to sixty-nine ninety-nine after that. The 500 is about sixty-nine ninety-nine intro and then eighty-nine ninety-nine regular.

Customer: Okay, so... (pause) that's quite a bit more than what I'm paying now, which I think is like thirty-nine ninety-nine?

Agent: Let me just confirm that for you. (typing) Yes, you're at thirty-nine ninety-nine monthly. So yeah, there's a difference, but I want to point out that we actually have a promotion running right now. If you upgrade today, I can lock in that forty-nine ninety-nine rate for twenty-four months instead of just twelve. That saves you almost five hundred dollars over the contract period compared to our standard pricing.

Customer: Oh, okay, that's... that's a bit better. What about the 500? Is there a deal on that too?

Agent: Great question. The 500 would be sixty-nine ninety-nine locked in for twenty-four months with that same promotion. So you're looking at either a fifty dollar or a thirty dollar monthly increase, depending on which tier you go with. And honestly, for your situation, I think the 400 would probably handle everything you need without being overkill.

Customer: Yeah, I mean... (trailing off) Is there anything else I should know? Like, would I need new equipment or anything?

Agent: That's a smart question. So your current modem is compatible with the 400 plan, which is good news. You won't need to swap anything out. We can do the upgrade right now on the phone, and it would typically take effect within twenty-four to forty-eight hours. You might experience a brief service interruption—like a few minutes—when we push the update to your modem, but that's it.

Customer: That's actually perfect because I was worried about that. Okay, um, I think I want to go with the 400. Let's do it.

Agent: Excellent choice! (typing sounds) Okay, I'm just setting this up here. So just to confirm everything—I'm upgrading your account from Frontier Fiber 100 to Frontier Fiber 400, effective as of today. The new rate is forty-nine ninety-nine for twenty-four months, locked in, and then it adjusts to our standard rate after that. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yes, that sounds right.

Agent: Perfect. And I'm seeing here that your billing date is on the fifteenth of each month, so we'll prorate any charges for this current billing cycle. (pause) Okay, I'm just about done entering this. Do you have an email address where you'd like me to send a confirmation of these changes?

Customer: Sure, it's [inaudible]... well, it's sarah.m.peterson at gmail, all one word, dot com.

Agent: (typing) Sarah.m.peterson at gmail.com. Got it. You should see that confirmation email within the next couple of hours. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. When should I expect the speeds to improve?

Agent: So like I mentioned, within twenty-four to forty-eight hours the upgrade will be active. You might notice the modem restart, but once it's back online, you should be getting those faster speeds right away. You could even do a quick speed test on any of your devices just to verify everything's working properly.

Customer: Great, thank you so much, Derek. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and thanks for calling in today. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too, bye!

Agent: Bye now!
