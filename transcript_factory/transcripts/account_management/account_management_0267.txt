Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan, and honestly, I'm thinking about upgrading. My internet's been pretty good, but I work from home now and I'm noticing some slowdowns when my wife is streaming and I'm on video calls.

Agent: Okay, I completely understand. Working from home definitely requires a stable, fast connection. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're on the Frontier Fiber 500 plan in the Scottsdale area. That's a great service. And you're looking to bump up your speed?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I think I need something faster. What are my options?

Agent: Well, the great news is that with our fiber infrastructure in your area, you have some excellent options. We can upgrade you to our 1-gigabit plan, which is ten times faster than what you currently have. Or, if you want something in between, we offer a 750 megabit tier as well.

Customer: Wow, okay. The gigabit one sounds pretty nice. What's that gonna run me, price-wise?

Agent: (typing sounds) So the 1-gigabit plan is normally $89.99 a month. However, since you're an existing customer with a good payment history, I can actually offer you a promotional rate for the first 12 months at $74.99 per month.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad. And after 12 months?

Agent: After the promotional period, it would go to the regular rate of $89.99, but we can always reevaluate your plan when that time comes. A lot of times we have other promotions available. There's no long-term contract, so you're free to make changes whenever you need to.

Customer: That sounds fair. How soon can you get that upgraded?

Agent: Great question. So I can process this upgrade right now, and it would be active on your account effective tomorrow morning. You shouldn't need any new equipment since your current modem can handle the gigabit speeds, but... (pause) actually, let me double-check what modem model you have. It should be listed here... (typing sounds) Yeah, you've got the newer model, so you're all set there.

Customer: Perfect. And I don't have to do anything on my end? Like, I don't need to restart anything or...?

Agent: Not necessarily right now. When the upgrade goes live tomorrow, you might want to do a quick restart of your modem and router just to make sure everything syncs up properly, but that's optional. Our system should handle it automatically. But honestly, a restart never hurts. I'd recommend just powering everything down for like 30 seconds and turning it back on.

Customer: Got it, I can do that. Is there anything else I should know about?

Agent: Let me think... (pause) One thing I should mention is that we're actually waiving the upgrade fee for you, which normally would be $50. And since you're upgrading, your first month's bill will be prorated. So depending on what day of the month you're currently on, you might see a slightly different charge on your next bill, but that's just how the proration works. Nothing to worry about.

Customer: Oh wow, no upgrade fee? That's awesome. Alright, I think I'm good then.

Agent: Perfect! Let me just go ahead and process this for you. (typing sounds) (pause) And... there we go. You're all set. So to recap, your new 1-gigabit plan at $74.99 a month for the first 12 months, effective tomorrow morning. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with your new plan details.

Customer: Awesome, thank you so much, Derek. I really appreciate it.

Agent: Hey, you're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks again!

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and enjoy that blazing-fast gigabit speed! Have a great day.

Customer: You too, take care!

Agent: Bye now!
