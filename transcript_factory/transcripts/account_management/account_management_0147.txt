Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks. So I've been with you guys for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. We've got some great options available. Before we dive into that, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, yeah, it should be the number I'm calling from, actually. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing your account. You're currently on our Fiber 200 plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've been on it for... I wanna say two years? And honestly, when I signed up, it was fine, but now I'm working from home a lot more, and my partner streams constantly, so...

Agent: Oh yeah, that's a pretty common situation we see nowadays. Two people sharing the bandwidth, especially with streaming and remote work, 200 meg can definitely get tight. What kind of speeds are you looking to bump up to?

Customer: Well, I'm not totally sure. What would you recommend? Like, what's the next step up?

Agent: (pause) So we've got a few options. You could go up to our Fiber 500 plan, which would be double your current speed. That's really solid for households with multiple users and streaming. Then we also have Fiber 1 gig if you want to go all the way. That's our fastest option.

Customer: Okay, um... what's the price difference? Like, am I gonna see a huge jump in my bill?

Agent: Great question. Let me just... (typing sounds) pull up the current pricing for you. So your Fiber 200 is currently... looks like you're at $64.99 a month, right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: The Fiber 500 would be $89.99 a month, so that's about $25 more. And the Fiber 1 gig is $119.99. Now, the good news is we have a promotion running right now for existing customers upgrading their service. You'd get the first three months of the upgrade at a 30% discount.

Customer: Oh, really? So what would that come out to?

Agent: (typing sounds) For the 500 plan, that would bring it down to about $62.99 per month for the first three months, then it goes to the regular $89.99 after that.

Customer: Wait, so for the first three months it'd actually be cheaper than what I'm paying now?

Agent: Exactly! You'd be getting double the speed and paying less initially. It's a pretty solid deal, honestly.

Customer: (laughs) Okay, that actually doesn't sound too bad. But I guess I'm wondering... would the 500 be enough? Like, how many people can use it at once before it gets all bogged down?

Agent: That's a smart question. So with Fiber 500, you're really looking at supporting multiple high-bandwidth activities simultaneously without any issues. Like, you could be in a video call, your partner could be streaming 4K Netflix, and someone could be gaming in the background without seeing any real degradation in performance. For a household of two, that's really more than sufficient.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. And I wouldn't need a new modem or anything, right? Like, my current equipment would work?

Agent: (pause) Actually, that's a good point. Let me check what modem you currently have on your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so you've got our Model FG2350A. That modem maxes out at about 200 meg, so to take full advantage of the 500 plan, we'd want to upgrade you to our newer FG4350 model. That one's compatible with the speeds you'd be getting.

Customer: Do I have to buy it or...?

Agent: So we can either upgrade you with our equipment for a $10 monthly fee, or if you prefer, you can purchase your own compatible modem. A lot of customers do that as a one-time cost. That's totally up to you.

Customer: How much is a modem usually?

Agent: You're probably looking at anywhere from $80 to $150 depending on where you shop. So if you plan to stick with Frontier for a while, the $10 a month through us actually ends up being the better deal in the long run.

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I'm not planning on going anywhere. Okay, let's do it. Let's upgrade to the 500.

Agent: Awesome, I'm glad we could find a good solution for you. And just to confirm, we'd upgrade your modem to the FG4350 with the $10 monthly fee, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm processing this upgrade right now. The new service should be active within 24 hours. You'll see the speed increase automatically once it kicks in. And you should receive an email confirmation with all the details... (pause) ...and there we go, that's all set. Your account's been updated.

Customer: That was fast. Do I need to do anything on my end?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. The modem we're sending out will arrive within 3 to 5 business days, and it comes with instructions, but it's pretty straightforward to set up. You just connect it like you would your old one. Our support team can also walk you through it over the phone if you need.

Customer: Great, I appreciate that.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for the help, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer, and enjoy that faster internet. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, thanks again.

Agent: Bye now.
