# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've had the same plan for like three years now and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've actually expanded our offerings quite a bit. I'd be happy to help you find something better. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Jennifer Walsh.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. A hundred megs, right?

Agent: That's right. So what's been happening? Are you noticing slower speeds, or is there something specific that's prompted the upgrade?

Customer: Well, my son moved back home during the pandemic and... (laughs) he's still here, honestly. We've got like four devices streaming at once sometimes, plus I'm working from home now. The connection just keeps dropping, and everything loads super slow. It's frustrating.

Agent: Oh yeah, I hear that a lot these days. More devices definitely require more bandwidth. So we've got some great options for you. What's your budget looking like, or would you like me to just walk you through what we have available?

Customer: Um, I don't want to go too crazy with the price, but if it's going to actually work, I'm willing to pay a bit more. What do you recommend?

Agent: Great question. So for a household with multiple users like yours, I'd probably recommend our Fiber 400 plan. That's 400 megabits per second, which would handle all those simultaneous streams without any issues. Or if you want to really future-proof yourself, we have Fiber 1 Gig, which is one gigabit per second.

Customer: (pause) Wow, one gig? That seems like overkill.

Agent: I mean, it might sound like a lot, but honestly, with prices dropping and technology improving, a lot of customers are going that route. Plus, you're locked in for two years at a promotional rate. But the 400 plan is also really solid and very popular. It's about a thirty-dollar jump from what you're paying now.

Customer: Thirty dollars more? What are you paying now, like forty?

Agent: Let me see here... (typing sounds) You're at sixty-nine ninety-nine for the Fiber 100.

Customer: Oh, it is? I thought it was cheaper than that. Doesn't matter though. So the 400 would be...?

Agent: That would be ninety-nine ninety-nine per month for the first twelve months, then it goes to one-nineteen ninety-nine. And then the Gig would be one-forty-nine ninety-nine, promotional, then one-sixty-nine ninety-nine after the first year.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... ninety-nine ninety-nine for 400 megs. When could that be installed? Do I have to schedule something?

Agent: Good news there. Since you're already a customer with Fiber service to your address, it's actually just a modem upgrade. We can mail you the equipment, and honestly, most people can self-install in like fifteen minutes. There's no technician visit needed.

Customer: Really? That's actually... that's great. I was worried I'd have to take a day off work.

Agent: (chuckles) Not at all. We'd ship it out, and you'd have it within three to five business days typically. Then you'd just unplug your old modem, plug in the new one, and you're good to go. We'll have an activation code sent to you as well.

Customer: Perfect. Okay, so the 400 plan. Let me just—will I still have the same internet speeds all the time, or does it vary?

Agent: That's a great question. So fiber is more consistent than cable, but like any internet service, your actual speeds can vary slightly depending on network conditions, how you're connected, things like that. If you're hardwired to the modem with an ethernet cable, you'll see speeds closer to the full 400. Wi-Fi might be a bit less, but still plenty fast for what you're describing.

Customer: Got it. And there's no contract or anything weird, right?

Agent: There is a two-year service agreement to get that promotional pricing, but there's no equipment lease fee or anything like that. And you can always upgrade or make changes within that term if you need to.

Customer: Okay, that sounds reasonable. Let's do it. Let's upgrade to the 400.

Agent: Awesome, Jennifer. I'm going to get this processed for you. (typing sounds) Let me just confirm everything before we finalize. So upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 400, starting at ninety-nine ninety-nine monthly for twelve months. We're shipping the modem to... (pause) ...is 4422 Maple Drive still the correct address?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And your email is jennifer.walsh@email.com?

Customer: Uh, no, it's walsh.jennifer—j-e-n-n-i-f-e-r—at gmail dot com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it, let me correct that. walsh.jennifer@gmail.com.

Customer: Yes.

Agent: Great. So the modem should arrive within five business days. You'll get a tracking number via email, and then once you install it, just give us a call back to activate, or you can activate online through your customer portal. We'll send you instructions for that as well.

Customer: Okay, perfect. Do I need to do anything else right now?

Agent: Nope, that's it! You're all set. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for walking me through all that, Marcus. I appreciate it.

Agent: Absolutely, Jennifer. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and welcome to Fiber 400. You're going to love the speeds. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now.
