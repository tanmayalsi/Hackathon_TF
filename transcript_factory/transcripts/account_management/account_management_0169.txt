Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet plan. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore, especially with my kids doing schoolwork from home.

Agent: I totally understand. We get that a lot, especially with everyone streaming and working remotely these days. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, or maybe your account number if you have it handy?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got it here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've had it for about... I don't know, three years maybe? And it was fine at first, but now when multiple people are online—like, if my wife is on a Zoom call and the kids are doing their homework—everything just slows down to a crawl.

Agent: Yeah, that makes sense. A hundred megs can definitely get stretched thin with multiple users. What kind of speeds are you looking to upgrade to? We've got Fiber 200, Fiber 500, and then our top tier is Fiber Gig, which is a full gigabit connection.

Customer: How much more would that be? Like, what's the difference in price?

Agent: Great question. So your current plan is $69.99 a month, yeah?

Customer: I think so, yeah. Maybe a little more with taxes and stuff, but around there.

Agent: Right, so with taxes and fees you're probably looking at around $82 to $85 total. So if you upgrade to our Fiber 200, that's going to run you $89.99 a month. Fiber 500 is $119.99, and the Gig plan is $149.99. (pause) Does that help?

Customer: Wow, okay. So it's about another $40 a month for the Gig plan? That's... that's actually not as bad as I thought it'd be.

Agent: Yeah, it's a pretty good value, honestly. And with the Gig plan, you're getting download speeds up to one gigabit per second, so you'd have plenty of bandwidth for everyone at home. Multiple 4K streams, video calls, gaming—you name it, you won't have any issues.

Customer: That sounds really good, actually. But I mean... do I really need that much? I'm not trying to overpay if I don't have to.

Agent: That's smart thinking. Um, let me ask you this—how many devices are typically online at your place? And what are people mostly doing? Gaming, streaming video, that kind of thing?

Customer: Well, we've got... let's see... two laptops, three phones, a couple tablets, a smart TV. And yeah, usually during the day there's streaming happening. My daughter watches Netflix while she's working—I know, I tell her not to, but... (laughs) And my son games sometimes. He's not like a hardcore gamer, but you know, online multiplayer stuff.

Agent: (laughs) Yeah, I hear you. Okay, so honestly? For your situation, I'd probably recommend the Fiber 500. That gives you the speed bump you need for everything happening at once, but it's not like you're paying for something you won't use. It's a nice middle ground.

Customer: Five hundred sounds good to me. How quickly can you get that set up?

Agent: Excellent choice. So the good news is, we've already got the fiber infrastructure at your location, so we don't need to send a technician out for any line work or anything. But we do need to send someone to upgrade your gateway modem, which is pretty simple. Usually takes about 20, 30 minutes, tops.

Customer: Okay, so someone has to come to my house?

Agent: Yeah, just a quick visit. We can schedule that for a time that works best for you. Are you available weekdays, or would you prefer a weekend? I've got some openings here...

Customer: (pause) Weekends would be better. I'm working from home, and I don't want to have to take time off.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. Let me see what we have. How does Saturday, March 18th in the morning? We've got a 9 AM to 11 AM window available.

Customer: Yeah, that works. That's perfect, actually.

Agent: (typing sounds) Awesome, I've got you down for that. So just to recap everything—you're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500. Your new monthly rate is $119.99 plus tax, which should come to around $145 total. Your technician will be out on Saturday, March 18th between 9 and 11 in the morning to swap out your gateway. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Oh, wait—will my internet go out during the install? Like, how long will I be without it?

Agent: Good question. The technician might need to do a brief restart of the service, but it should only be a few minutes. Honestly, it goes pretty quick. You might not even notice.

Customer: Okay, great. Well, I really appreciate your help, Derek.

Agent: Hey, no problem at all. We're glad to have you upgrading with us. You're gonna love that extra speed, I promise. Just a couple reminders—you should receive a confirmation email shortly, and the technician will have everything they need to complete the upgrade. If you have any questions before Saturday, feel free to give us a call back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again!

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you Saturday morning!

Customer: Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
