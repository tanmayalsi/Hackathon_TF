Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've been hearing that a lot lately, especially with more people working from home. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've had it for about... I don't know, two years maybe? But lately my wife and I have both been working from home and the kids are streaming stuff constantly. It just feels slow, especially when multiple people are online.

Agent: Okay, that makes total sense. A hundred megs is great for basic browsing, but once you add multiple users with video conferencing and streaming, it gets maxed out pretty quick. (pause) What kind of speeds are you looking for?

Customer: Well, I'm not really sure what I need, to be honest. What would you recommend?

Agent: Great question. So we've got a few options that might work for you. Our next tier up is the Fiber 300 plan, which gives you, well, three hundred megs download. That's usually perfect for households with... (typing) ...say, three to four people doing different things online at once. Video calls, streaming, gaming, all of that simultaneously.

Customer: Three hundred sounds pretty good. What's the pricing on that?

Agent: So right now, I'm showing that our Fiber 300 plan is $79.99 a month for the first twelve months. After that, it goes to our standard rate of $99.99. With your current setup, there's no installation fee since you already have our fiber infrastructure in place.

Customer: Okay, and what about... I mean, is that just the internet, or does that include anything else?

Agent: That's just the internet service itself. Are you currently bundled with us for phone or TV services?

Customer: No, no, it's just the internet. We cut the cord a few years back.

Agent: (chuckling) Yeah, a lot of people are doing that. Well, if you ever wanted to add phone service, we do have some good bundle deals, but no pressure at all. Let me see here... (pause) I can actually offer you a promotional rate. If you sign up for the Fiber 300 today, I can lock you in at $74.99 for the first year instead of the seventy-nine ninety-nine.

Customer: Oh, wow, really? That's... yeah, that's better. How much of a difference is that actually going to be for my speeds though, compared to the hundred megs I have now?

Agent: So you're tripling your download speeds, basically. You're going from 100 to 300 megabits per second. The difference is pretty noticeable in real-world use—uploads will also increase from 10 to 50 megs. So if you're doing a lot of video conferencing or uploading files for work, you'll definitely feel that improvement.

Customer: Yeah, that sounds like what we need. And there's no hardware change or anything? I don't have to deal with a technician coming out?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. The upgrade happens on our end. You might need to restart your gateway—that's your modem and router combo—but we can walk you through that real quick, and it usually takes about five minutes.

Customer: Perfect. Okay, let's do it.

Agent: Awesome. (typing sounds) So I'm just gonna go ahead and set this up for you. The upgrade will be effective... (pause) ...starting tomorrow, so you should see the speed difference right away. I'm also going to send you an email confirmation with all the details, including your new bill amount. Is the email address we have on file still good?

Customer: What is it? You might have an old one.

Agent: I'm showing [inaudible] at gmail dot com?

Customer: No, no, that's old. Can you change it to... it's sarah.martinez82@gmail.com.

Agent: (typing) Sarah M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z... 82 at gmail dot com?

Customer: Yes, exactly.

Agent: Perfect, got that updated. You should receive that confirmation email within the next hour or so. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...I don't think so. This is great though, thanks for making it so easy.

Agent: You're very welcome. I really appreciate your business, and I think you're gonna be really happy with the upgrade. If you run into any issues or have questions once it goes live tomorrow, just don't hesitate to give us another call back. We're available 24/7.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again, Marcus.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and have a great day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
