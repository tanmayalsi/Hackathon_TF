Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently subscribed to your 100 meg fiber plan, and I'm thinking about upgrading. My work from home situation has kind of exploded, and I need something faster.

Agent: Oh, absolutely. I totally understand—a lot of our customers have been in that boat. Let me pull up your account here real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got you here. So you're on our Fiber 100 plan—that's been active for about two years now, correct?

Customer: Yeah, sounds about right.

Agent: Great. And you're looking to upgrade to a faster speed tier. What kind of activities are you doing that require the additional bandwidth? Just so I can make sure we get you on the right plan.

Customer: Well, I'm doing a lot of video conferencing—like, back-to-back Zoom calls all day. And my partner also works from home, so we're both streaming and uploading files constantly. Plus we've got smart home stuff, and honestly, our Netflix keeps buffering, which is... (laughs) not ideal.

Agent: (laughs) Yeah, that's frustrating. With two people working from home simultaneously and all those connected devices, I'd definitely recommend stepping up. We have our Fiber 300 plan—that's 300 megabits down—or our Fiber 500 plan if you want to really future-proof yourself. What's your budget looking like?

Customer: Uh, I don't want to go crazy. I mean, what's the price difference? I'm paying like... $70 something a month right now?

Agent: You're at $69.99 a month, actually. For the Fiber 300, we can get you set up at $89.99 per month for the first year, and then it goes to $109.99 after that. The 500 would be $119.99 for the first year, then $139.99. And both of those include our standard equipment rental.

Customer: (pause) So the 300 is twenty bucks more to start. That's not too bad. What about installation? Do I need a tech to come out?

Agent: Great question. So with your existing setup, since you're already a fiber customer in that area, we can actually do a self-install kit for the 300 plan. We'd mail you the new modem and router, and the whole process takes maybe 15 to 20 minutes if you're comfortable doing it yourself. No technician visit, no installation fee.

Customer: Oh nice, that's convenient. And the equipment—what am I getting?

Agent: You'd get our latest Fiber Gateway modem-router combo. It's got WiFi 6 capability, so you'll have excellent coverage throughout your home. Much faster than what you're currently using.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. (pause) Yeah, I think the 300 plan makes sense. When could we get that switched over?

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect choice. So I can get the process started right now. The new equipment should arrive within 3 to 5 business days, and you can activate it at your convenience. Your service will automatically upgrade on the date we set, which I'd recommend being the same day you receive the equipment.

Customer: Can we do that this week?

Agent: Let me see here... (typing sounds) If you approve this today, we can have it shipped out tomorrow, and you're looking at Thursday or Friday delivery. Would Friday work for you?

Customer: Friday's perfect.

Agent: Excellent. And just to confirm, I'm seeing your service address on file is 2847 Maple Drive—is that still correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So before I process this, I do want to let you know—your promotional rate is locked in for 12 months. After that, the rate will adjust to $109.99 monthly. You can always call us back before that date if you'd like to explore other options or lock in a new rate. Sound fair?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. I'll probably call back closer to that time anyway.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, and I'm going to add a courtesy credit to your account too—$20 off your first month with the upgraded service, just to help with the transition.

Customer: Oh, really? That's great, thanks.

Agent: Of course! Now, one more thing—do you want to keep your same billing date, or would you like to adjust it?

Customer: No, keep it the same. That's easier.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Okay, everything is all set here. Your new Fiber 300 plan is confirmed. You'll see a confirmation email in just a moment with all the details, the tracking information for your equipment, and step-by-step activation instructions. Do you have any other questions for me?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. This should really help with everything.

Agent: Fantastic. I'm confident it will. You're going to notice a huge difference, especially with those video calls. If you run into any issues during setup on Friday, just give us a call back and we'll walk you through it, okay?

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your business!

Customer: Thanks, have a good one.

Agent: You too. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
