Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, my name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. I'm actually calling because I'm thinking about upgrading my internet service. I've had Frontier for about two years now and I'm pretty happy, but I'm working from home a lot more these days and my current speed just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Oh, I completely understand. Working from home definitely requires a solid connection. Let me help you find something that'll work better for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... uh... (pause) it's the number you're calling me from, actually. The area code is 520.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here. Just give me one second... (pause) Okay, I've got you. And your name is Michael, correct?

Customer: That's right, Michael Richardson.

Agent: Great, Michael. So I see you're currently on our 100 Mbps plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Look, I don't need anything crazy expensive, but I've been having these video calls with clients and the upload speed is just... it's lagging. My kids are also doing online school, so there's a lot going on at once.

Agent: Mm-hmm, yeah, that's a common issue with 100 Mbps when you've got multiple users. For what you're describing—video conferencing and remote school—I'd honestly recommend looking at our 400 Mbps plan. That gives you really solid upload speeds, like around 20 Mbps, which is great for video calls.

Customer: Okay, 400... and what's the pricing on that? I mean, I don't want to get sticker shock here.

Agent: (chuckles) I get it. So right now we're running a promotion for new upgrades. I can get you on the 400 Mbps plan for $74.99 a month for the first year, and then it goes to $89.99 after that. That's compared to what, $59.99 you're probably paying now, so it's about fifteen bucks more to start.

Customer: Hmm, that's... I mean, that's not too bad actually. What about the 300 Mbps plan? Is that an option?

Agent: It absolutely is. We have that at $64.99 for the first year, then $84.99 after. You'd get around 15 to 18 Mbps upload with that one, which is still pretty solid. The difference between that and the 400 is really noticeable when you've got three or four people online at once, but if it's mainly just you and maybe one other person, the 300 would definitely work.

Customer: (pause) So my wife works from home too, sometimes. And we've got three kids, so yeah, there's definitely multiple people. I think the 400 sounds like the safer bet then.

Agent: Yeah, I think that's a smart call. You'll really notice the difference, especially on those video calls. And hey, the upload speeds will make a huge difference for your situation. Let me just confirm—you're at the same address on Sycamore Drive, right?

Customer: Yeah, same place.

Agent: Perfect. So I can get you upgraded to 400 Mbps. The installation is free since you're an existing customer, and we can typically get a technician out to you within... (typing sounds) let me see what we have available... within the next five to seven business days. Does that timeframe work for you?

Customer: That's fine. Can you do like a weekday? I work from home but I do go out for client meetings sometimes.

Agent: Absolutely. We've got some availability on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. Would either of those work?

Customer: Wednesday would be better. Morning preferred if you've got it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so I can schedule you for Wednesday, March 19th between 8 AM and 12 PM. A technician will come out and essentially swap out your modem and router for new equipment that supports the faster speeds. It should take about an hour, maybe a little less.

Customer: Okay, great. And I don't have to do anything beforehand, right?

Agent: Nope, just make sure you have your current equipment available—your modem and router. The tech will take care of everything else. You'll be up and running with the new speeds same day.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I should know about?

Agent: (pause) One thing—I do want to mention we also have our Frontier Secure service, which includes antivirus and malware protection for all your devices. It's normally $9.99 a month but I can add it to your first month for free if you'd like to try it out.

Customer: Uh, [inaudible] I've actually got that covered with another service, so I'm good there.

Agent: No problem at all. Well, Michael, let me just recap everything here. You're being upgraded to our 400 Mbps Fiber plan at $74.99 for the first year. The installation is free, and you're scheduled for Wednesday, March 19th in the morning window. I'm gonna send you a confirmation email, and we'll also send you a text message as a reminder the day before.

Customer: Sounds good. Hey, one last thing—my bill, when does that change over?

Agent: Great question. Your new rate will start on your next billing cycle, which based on your current account is April 1st. So you'll have one more month at your current rate, and then the new charge starts.

Customer: Okay, perfect. That works out. Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael. We really appreciate your business, and I think you're gonna be really happy with that speed bump. If you have any questions before Wednesday, feel free to give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks again.

Agent: Bye now!
