# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. I've got the basic plan right now and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. We've had a lot of customers saying the same thing, especially with more people working from home these days. What speed are you currently on?

Customer: I think it's like, 100 megabits? Maybe? I'm not really sure, to be honest. But my wife's been complaining because when she's doing her Zoom calls, my streaming just tanks. And our kid's doing online school so it's just a mess.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so yeah, 100 megs is definitely feeling the strain with multiple devices. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... uh... (pause) ...it's 555-0847. That's the main line for the house.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm getting that here. Okay, so I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years. Great customer, no late payments or anything. And yes, you're on our basic fiber plan at 100 Mbps. So what kind of speeds were you thinking you'd need?

Customer: I honestly don't know what's realistic. What do you have available at my address?

Agent: Great question. So at your location, we can actually get you up to our 500 Mbps plan, or if you want to go all out, we have gig internet—that's 1,000 Mbps—but that one's a little pricier.

Customer: Wow, okay. What's the difference in price?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) So your current plan is $59.99 a month. Our 500 Mbps plan would be $89.99 monthly. And the gig plan is $129.99. But here's the thing—I might actually be able to help you out a bit better than that. Are you on any promotional pricing right now?

Customer: I mean... I don't think so? I've just been paying the same thing for like two years.

Agent: Okay, so you're due for an upgrade credit. Because you've been loyal to us and you're current on your account, I can actually sign you up for the 500 Mbps plan at $79.99 for the first twelve months instead of the regular price. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh wow, that's... yeah, that's actually not bad. And after the twelve months?

Agent: After that, it would go to the regular rate of $89.99. But honestly, that's competitive pricing and you could always call back in a year to see if we have other promotions available.

Customer: Right, okay. And can you... I mean, is this something you can set up today? When would they come out?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. So since you already have fiber to your location, this is actually pretty simple. We don't even need a technician visit for most upgrades. We can do it remotely, and you'd be good to go within a couple hours of me processing this.

Customer: (pause) Really? That easy?

Agent: That easy. We'd just reset your gateway—that's your modem and router—and boost you up to the 500 Mbps tier. I just need to confirm a few details with you. Your address is still 342 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And is this the address where you want the service active?

Customer: Yes, same place.

Agent: Great. (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, you want to upgrade to the 500 Mbps plan at the promotional rate of $79.99 per month for the first year. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that works for me.

Agent: Fantastic. So I'm gonna need you to sign an authorization here. I can email you a digital copy you can sign, or I can take your verbal authorization right now and we can get this processed immediately.

Customer: Can you just do it now? I don't want to mess with emails if I don't have to.

Agent: (laughs) I hear you. Okay, so just to verify—by proceeding, you're authorizing Frontier Communications to upgrade your service to the 500 Mbps fiber plan at the rate of $79.99 monthly, with the rate adjusting to $89.99 after the promotional period ends. Do you authorize this?

Customer: Yes, I do. Go ahead.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And just FYI, your bill should reflect the change on your next billing cycle. So you'll get one more bill at your current rate, and then the new rate starts after that.

Customer: Okay, cool. And it really takes just a couple hours?

Agent: Yep. I'm gonna send a remote push to your equipment, probably within the next hour or so. Your internet might drop for like thirty seconds while the gateway reboots. But after that, you should be seeing those speeds.

Customer: That's awesome.

Agent: So just one more thing—do you want to keep the same gateway you have, or would you like us to send you a newer model? Newer equipment does have WiFi 6 capability, which is pretty nice if you've got a lot of devices.

Customer: Oh... I mean, do I have to pay extra for that?

Agent: No, actually. Since you're upgrading, I can ship you a new gateway at no additional cost. It's just part of the upgrade package. Takes about three to five business days to arrive, but in the meantime, your speeds will already be activated on your current equipment.

Customer: Oh, well then yeah, definitely send the new one.

Agent: (pause, typing) You got it. I've got that all set up for you. It'll ship out tomorrow morning, and you should have it by early next week. There's a prepaid label in the box when you get it if you want to return your old gateway, or you can just set it aside.

Customer: Perfect.

Agent: Alright, so just to recap everything—you're upgraded to 500 Mbps at $79.99 a month for the first year. Your speeds activate within the hour. New gateway ships tomorrow, arrives by early next week. And you've got... (pause) ...you've got a confirmation number here. Let me read that to you.

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent: It's 8847-FR-5529. I'm also gonna send you an email confirmation with all of this information, your new rate, the authorization, everything.

Customer: Great, thanks. This was actually pretty painless. (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) Happy to help! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. My wife's gonna be really happy when she can actually stay on her Zoom calls without buffering.

Agent: (laughs) Well, that's what we like to hear. Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and thank you for being a loyal customer. We really appreciate it.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Take care!
