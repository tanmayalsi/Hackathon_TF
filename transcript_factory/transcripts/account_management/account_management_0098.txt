# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with your service, but I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate that! We love hearing our customers are satisfied. I'd be happy to help you explore upgrade options. Can I grab your account information first? What's the phone number or account number associated with your service?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I've got you. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 200 plan at 200 megabits per second. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. I've been on that for a while, but with working from home now and my family streaming... it's just getting slow, you know? I need something faster.

Agent: Totally understand. That's actually really common right now. Well, the good news is you're in one of our fiber service areas, so we've got some great options for you. We have our Fiber 500 plan, which is 500 megs, and then our Fiber 1 Gig, which is one gigabit per second. Are either of those speeds something you'd be interested in?

Customer: Um, what's the difference in price? I don't want to... I mean, I need faster internet, but I also don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (pause) That's fair. So right now, your Fiber 200 is running you... let me see here... $79.99 a month. Our Fiber 500 would be $99.99 a month, so that's an additional twenty dollars. And our Fiber 1 Gig is $129.99 a month.

Customer: Oh, okay. So the 500 plan would be fifty percent more speed for basically twenty-five percent more cost?

Agent: Exactly, yeah! You've got the math right. And honestly, for a household that's working from home and streaming, the 500 plan is what a lot of our customers go with. It's a really good sweet spot.

Customer: Yeah, that sounds reasonable. But... do I have to sign a contract? Because last time I looked at upgrading, I thought I saw something about a two-year agreement.

Agent: Good question. So we do offer a two-year price guarantee when you sign an agreement, which actually locks in a promotional rate. Without the agreement, the price could potentially increase after the promotional period. But we're not forcing anything on you—it's really your choice. What works better for you?

Customer: (pause) How much savings are we talking with the contract?

Agent: Let me check what we can offer you here... (typing sounds) Okay, so with the two-year agreement, I can actually get you the Fiber 500 for $89.99 a month instead of the regular $99.99. So that's an extra ten dollars in savings per month.

Customer: Oh, that's actually pretty good. Yeah, I think I'll do the contract. I'm probably going to be here for a while anyway.

Agent: Great choice! So just to recap, we're upgrading you from Fiber 200 to Fiber 500 at $89.99 a month with a two-year price guarantee. (pause) One thing I do want to mention—your current modem should actually work fine with this speed, but it might be worth upgrading to our newer equipment for optimal performance. We have a modem we could swap out for you for about $9.99 a month, but again, totally optional.

Customer: Is it necessary?

Agent: Not necessarily, but it would give you the full speed capability. Our older modems can handle 500 megs, but the new ones are faster and more reliable. Most customers who upgrade go ahead and make the switch.

Customer: Okay, sure. Why not? Just throw it in.

Agent: Perfect! (typing sounds) So I'm going to get that modem ordered for you. You should receive it within... (pause) ...three to five business days. We can either have you install it yourself—it's pretty straightforward—or we can schedule a technician to come out if you'd prefer.

Customer: I think I can handle it myself. I'm pretty tech-savvy.

Agent: Awesome. We'll include instructions in the box, and if you run into any issues, you can always call us back. Is the address we have on file still good?

Customer: Which address do you have?

Agent: I'm showing 4521 Maple Ridge Drive, apartment 3B.

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So we'll get that modem sent there. The upgrade itself will be activated on your account... (typing sounds) ...tomorrow morning. So you should wake up tomorrow and have the faster speeds, even before the modem arrives.

Customer: Oh wow, that's quick! Great.

Agent: Yep! Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. This was really easy. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you so much for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You should see those speed improvements right away. If you have any questions or run into any issues, don't hesitate to give us a call.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!
