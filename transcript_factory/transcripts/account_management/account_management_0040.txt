# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, I'm currently on like the 300 meg plan or something, and I'm thinking about upgrading. My kids are doing online school now and we've got a lot of devices streaming and working from home, so it's just getting a little slow, you know?

Agent: Oh, absolutely. I totally understand. Working from home and kids on school WiFi can definitely eat up your bandwidth. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this a residential account in... (pause) ...looks like Tucson, Arizona?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. Okay, so I'm looking at your account now and you're currently on our 300 megabit plan. You've been with us for about two years, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, sounds about right. We moved here about two years ago and switched over from our old provider.

Agent: Excellent. Well, I appreciate your loyalty. So what we have available in your area right now, we can definitely move you up to our 500 megabit plan, or if you want to really future-proof yourself, we have our gigabit fiber option available.

Customer: Oh, gigabit? Like a full gig? That seems like overkill...

Agent: (laughs) Well, it might seem like a lot now, but the way usage is going, especially with multiple people streaming and working simultaneously, it's becoming pretty standard. Plus, you'd get priority support and it's actually... let me see here... (typing) ...it's only about fifteen dollars more per month than the 500 meg plan.

Customer: Oh really? Fifteen bucks isn't too bad. What would that bring my total to?

Agent: Okay, so your current bill is $89.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: If you upgrade to our gigabit plan, we can get you set up for $104.99 a month for the first twelve months, and then it goes to $119.99 after that. And that includes our fiber modem and WiFi 6 router at no additional equipment charge.

Customer: Hmm. And how long would it take to get installed? I really need it sooner rather than later because next week my daughter's got some important assessments coming up...

Agent: (typing) I can definitely check availability for you. Let me see what we've got open. What days work best for you? We typically have morning and afternoon windows.

Customer: Um, like, what about Thursday?

Agent: (typing) Thursday, perfect. So we have an afternoon slot available, between 1 and 5 PM on Thursday. Would that work?

Customer: That works. That's great, actually.

Agent: Wonderful. And just so you know, since you're upgrading your service tier, you'll need our technician to come out and verify line capacity to your home. It's usually about a thirty to forty-five minute appointment, and they'll make sure everything's optimized for your new speeds.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?

Agent: That's a good question. Just make sure your main entry point is accessible — that's usually where the fiber comes in — and someone needs to be home to let the technician in. They'll take care of the rest. You'll want to have all your devices ready to reconnect to the new WiFi network after they set up the router.

Customer: Got it. So I'll get a new router?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. The WiFi 6 router is included with the gigabit plan, and it's going to give you a much stronger and faster signal than your current equipment.

Customer: That's awesome. When do I get the new equipment? Do they bring it Thursday?

Agent: Great question. Yes, the technician will bring everything and install it all during that appointment on Thursday. You'll be good to go right away.

Customer: Perfect. Um, one more thing... (pause) ...do I have a contract or anything? Can I cancel if I don't like it?

Agent: That's another great question. We don't have long-term contracts, so you're month-to-month. However, if you wanted to lock in that promotional rate of $104.99, we can do a one-year price guarantee, and you'd still have the ability to cancel anytime without penalty.

Customer: Oh, that's nice. Yeah, let's do that. The price guarantee sounds good.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to go ahead and process this upgrade for you. (typing sounds) So let me confirm everything here. You're upgrading to our 1 gigabit fiber plan with WiFi 6 router, installation Thursday between 1 and 5 PM, and you're locked in at $104.99 for twelve months. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.

Agent: You're very welcome. Now, you'll receive a confirmation email in just a few minutes with all your appointment details and a phone number for the technician if you need to reschedule. You can also text that number if the technician is running a little late. Is the email address we have on file still... [inaudible]...@gmail.com?

Customer: Um, actually could you update that? It's jsmith2024@outlook.com.

Agent: Absolutely. (typing) j-s-m-i-t-h-2-0-2-4 at outlook dot com. Got it, updated. You'll get that confirmation there in a few minutes.

Customer: Awesome. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Just remember to have someone home Thursday, keep that entry point accessible, and you should be all set. Your new gigabit speeds should really make a difference with everything you're doing. If you have any issues after installation or any questions before Thursday, just give us a call back or you can reach out through your online account.

Customer: Great. Thanks so much, Derek. I really appreciate it.

Agent: It's my pleasure. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and I hope your daughter does great on those assessments next week!

Customer: That's very kind of you to say. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
