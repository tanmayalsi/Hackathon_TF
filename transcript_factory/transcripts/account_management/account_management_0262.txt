Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine for a while, but now with my kids doing remote schooling and my wife working from home... I mean, we're all trying to use the internet at the same time and it just gets really slow. Especially when someone's streaming or whatever.

Agent: Oh yeah, I hear that a lot, especially with how things have changed. So you need more bandwidth to handle multiple users. That makes total sense. We've actually got some great options for you. (typing sounds) So with your current Fiber 100, you're getting 100 megabits per second. We could bump you up to our Fiber 300 plan, which gives you 300 megabits per second, or if you really want the best performance, we have Fiber 500.

Customer: What's the difference in price? I mean, I don't want to go crazy, but I also don't want to keep dealing with this lag.

Agent: Right, totally fair. So your current plan is... let me see here... you're paying $59.99 a month. If you upgrade to the Fiber 300, that would be $79.99 a month. And the Fiber 500 would be $99.99 a month.

Customer: Hmm, and that's just for internet, right? That doesn't include anything else?

Agent: Yes, that's just internet service. We don't have you bundled with TV or phone currently, correct?

Customer: Right, we've got TV through another provider, and we use cell phones, so we're good there.

Agent: Perfect. So those prices I quoted are just for the internet service. Now, I should mention we do have a promotional offer right now. If you upgrade today, I can lock you in at $74.99 for the Fiber 300 plan for the first year. After that, it goes to the regular price of $79.99.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad. And how long is that promotion good for?

Agent: (pause) It's good through the end of this month, so you'd want to make the switch pretty soon if you want to take advantage of that.

Customer: Okay, cool. And if I go with the 300, will I need new equipment, or can I just keep what I have?

Agent: That's a great question. Your current modem should actually be compatible with the higher speeds, but let me double-check that for you. (typing sounds) Yeah, so you're using the Frontier model FX-2700 modem. You know what, to get the full benefit of the Fiber 300 speeds, I'd actually recommend upgrading to our newer FX-3800 modem. It's designed specifically for these higher-speed plans. The good news is the upgrade is free, and we'd ship it to you. It would take about 3 to 5 business days to arrive.

Customer: And I'd have to install it myself?

Agent: So we can either send you the modem and provide you with instructions—it's pretty straightforward, just plug and play basically—or if you'd prefer, we can schedule a technician to come out and install it for you. There would be a $49.99 service fee for the technician visit.

Customer: How long does the install usually take?

Agent: Typically about 30 to 45 minutes. And the technician can come out pretty much any weekday between 8 AM and 6 PM, or we have some Saturday appointments available too.

Customer: (pause) You know what, I think I can handle the self-install. How hard can it be, right? (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) Honestly, most people do just fine with it. We'll include detailed instructions in the box, and if you run into any issues, you can always call us back and we can walk you through it.

Customer: Perfect. So just to confirm, I'm upgrading to the Fiber 300 for $74.99 for the first year?

Agent: Exactly. And just so you're aware, after the first year, the price will be $79.99 per month, unless there are other promotions available at that time. We can definitely set you up with a reminder before the promotional rate expires so there aren't any surprises.

Customer: That's good to know. And when would this take effect?

Agent: (typing sounds) So I can process this for you right now and get it activated tomorrow. The new modem should arrive within 3 to 5 business days. Once it arrives, you'll just swap it out with your current modem, and you should be all set.

Customer: Awesome. Yeah, let's do it.

Agent: Great! Let me just review everything with you before we finalize this. You're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, promotional rate of $74.99 per month for the first 12 months, then $79.99 monthly. We're sending you the new FX-3800 modem at no charge, which should arrive in 3 to 5 business days. And you'll be doing the self-installation. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect.

Agent: Wonderful. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm processing this now... (pause) And it's all set! Your new plan is active starting tomorrow. You should receive a confirmation email within the next couple hours with all the details and a tracking number for your modem once it ships out.

Customer: Perfect. I really appreciate your help, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks so much.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and I hope you enjoy those faster speeds! Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
