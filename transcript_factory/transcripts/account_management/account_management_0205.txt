# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your Frontier account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're currently on our Frontier Broadband 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've had it for... I don't know, maybe three years now? But honestly, my wife's been working from home since, you know, the pandemic stuff, and we've got two kids who are constantly streaming videos and doing online school assignments. The speeds just aren't fast enough anymore. We're getting buffering and everything.

Agent: I completely understand. Multiple users can definitely strain a lower-speed connection. (pause) So with our Frontier Fiber network, we have some excellent options available in your area. Can I ask what kind of speeds you're looking for?

Customer: Well, I'm not... I mean, I don't really know what I need, to be honest. What would you recommend?

Agent: Great question. So for a household with multiple users like yours, I'd typically recommend at least our Fiber 300 plan, which gives you 300 megabits per second download speeds. That's three times what you're getting now. But we also have Fiber 500 if you want even more headroom for...

Customer: Wait, is that... is that actually Fiber? Because I've heard Fiber is supposed to be like, really fast and reliable, right?

Agent: Exactly! Yes, Fiber is a completely different technology than what you're currently on. Your current Broadband 100 is delivered over copper lines, but Fiber goes directly to your home. It's faster, more stable, and honestly, it's the future of home internet. And the good news is we've confirmed Fiber availability at your address.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. So what's the difference in price between what I'm paying now and the Fiber 300?

Agent: (typing sounds) So you're currently on our Broadband 100 at $49.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, sounds about right.

Agent: Our Frontier Fiber 300 would be $69.99 per month. And if you're willing to commit to a two-year agreement, I can actually get you a promotional rate of $59.99 for the first year. So you'd be saving money initially compared to the regular price, and you're tripling your speeds.

Customer: Hmm, that's... that's actually not too bad. What about the 500 one you mentioned?

Agent: The Fiber 500 is $89.99 per month regularly, or with the same two-year promotion, $79.99 for your first year.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... what's included? Like, do I get a new modem or something?

Agent: Great question. Yes, with the upgrade, we'll provide you with our latest Frontier Fiber gateway at no additional cost. It replaces your current modem and router. We typically schedule a technician visit to handle the installation, and that's also complimentary as part of the service upgrade. The whole process usually takes about an hour or so.

Customer: And I'd get faster internet right away?

Agent: Right away, yes. Once the technician activates your Fiber connection, you should see the speed improvements immediately. We can actually schedule that installation at your earliest convenience. When would work best for you?

Customer: Uh, let me think. This week is pretty crazy with work and everything, but... maybe next Friday? That's the 15th?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability for next Friday, the 15th. We have morning slots between 8 and 11 AM, or afternoon slots between 1 and 5 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: The afternoon would be better. Around 2 or 3 o'clock?

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule you for Friday the 15th between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will confirm a specific time the day before. And just to confirm, you want to go with the Fiber 300 at the promotional rate of $59.99 for the first year?

Customer: Yeah, actually, you know what? My wife mentioned something about needing better speeds for her video calls. Can we do the 500? It's only $20 more, right?

Agent: That's smart thinking, and yes, it would be $20 more per month after year one. The extra speed will definitely help with all those video conferences and everything else going on in your house.

Customer: Okay, let's do the 500.

Agent: Excellent. (pause) Alright, so I'm going to get you set up here. I just need to verify a couple of things. Is the service address still 2847 Maple Ridge Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: And is the best contact number still 555-0147?

Customer: Yep, that's my cell, so I'll definitely see any calls or texts from your team.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, your upgrade is all set. You're going to receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all your details and the installation appointment. And one more thing—since you're upgrading, I'm going to add $25 in service credit to your first bill as a thank you.

Customer: Oh, wow, that's nice of you. Thanks!

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I'm pretty excited to get the Fiber installed. Thanks for walking me through all this.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You're going to love the speeds. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
