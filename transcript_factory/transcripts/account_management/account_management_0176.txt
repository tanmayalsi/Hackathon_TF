Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with the service, but I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. My current plan is... I think it's the 100 megabit plan?

Agent: That's great to hear you've been happy with us! Let me just pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. And I'm seeing you're on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Awesome. So what's driving the interest in upgrading today? Are you finding that your current speeds aren't quite cutting it anymore?

Customer: Well, my son moved back home during the pandemic, and now we've got like four people working from home on video calls all the time. Plus we're streaming constantly. The internet just feels slower than it used to, you know?

Agent: Oh, I completely understand. That's actually something we're hearing from a lot of customers right now. With multiple people streaming and doing video conferencing simultaneously, 100 megs can definitely get bogged down. (pause) We have some great options for you. What kind of speeds are you thinking about?

Customer: I'm not really sure, to be honest. What would you recommend?

Agent: Well, here's what I'd suggest. For a household with four people doing heavy usage like you described—video conferencing, streaming, gaming, all that—I'd recommend looking at our Fiber 300 plan. That gives you 300 megabits download. It's gonna be a huge difference from what you're experiencing now.

Customer: Three hundred? Wow. Is that... I mean, how much more would that cost me?

Agent: (typing sounds) So right now you're at $69.99 a month for the Fiber 100. The Fiber 300 is $99.99 a month, so that's about $30 more per month.

Customer: Thirty dollars more... (pause) And that's gonna actually make a noticeable difference?

Agent: Absolutely. The speeds are three times faster, so you'll have way more bandwidth for everyone in your home. Plus, we actually have a promotion running right now where the first six months are discounted. Let me see here... (typing sounds) Yes, so for the first six months, you'd be looking at $79.99 a month instead of $99.99. After that, it goes to the regular price.

Customer: Oh, okay, that's better. So that's saving me like... what, $120 over six months?

Agent: That's right. And just to mention, if you do decide to upgrade, there's no installation fee right now either. We can typically get you scheduled within the next week or so.

Customer: Really? No installation fee? That's nice. (pause) Okay, I think I want to do it. But let me ask you—will I need to change any equipment? Like my router or anything?

Agent: Good question. So you'll need a new gateway—that's our modem and router combined. We'll actually mail that to you before the installation appointment, so you'll have it ahead of time. Our tech can help get it set up during the appointment, or if you're comfortable doing it yourself, there are instructions included.

Customer: Okay, and this is definitely fiber, right? Not cable?

Agent: Yes, 100% fiber. You're in a great service area for us. That's actually why you've had such reliable service with us already. The fiber connection is really premium infrastructure.

Customer: Cool, cool. So what do I need to do to actually make this change?

Agent: Well, I can actually process this upgrade for you right now while we're on the call. Let me just go through a couple things with you. (pause) Your service address is still 2847 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And I'm showing your service can be upgraded immediately. What I'd like to do is schedule an installation appointment for you. Would you prefer a morning or afternoon appointment? And do you have any days this week that work better than others?

Customer: Um... (pause) This week is kind of crazy. Could we do next week? Like Tuesday or Wednesday would be ideal.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability for next Tuesday and Wednesday. (pause) We have a morning slot on Tuesday between 8 AM and 12 PM, or an afternoon slot on Wednesday between 1 PM and 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: The Wednesday afternoon would be perfect.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) I've got you scheduled for Wednesday, May 19th, between 1 PM and 5 PM. Our technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive to let you know their ETA. Is the best number to reach you the one you called from?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. So to recap everything—you're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300. Your new rate is $79.99 for the first six months, then $99.99 after that. You'll receive a new gateway in the mail within the next few days, and we have you scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. You should see an updated bill within a couple of days as well.

Customer: That sounds good. And just to confirm, no installation fee, right?

Agent: That's correct. No installation fee. This is a promotional offer, so it's all included.

Customer: Awesome. I really appreciate it, Derek.

Agent: You bet! Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer. I think you're really gonna love the upgrade. You'll definitely notice the difference with everything you've got going on at home. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
