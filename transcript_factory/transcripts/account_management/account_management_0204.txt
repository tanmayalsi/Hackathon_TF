Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, so I've had your internet service for about three years now, and I'm pretty happy with it, but I'm thinking about upgrading. My current plan is... I think it's the 500 meg plan?

Agent: Great! I'm glad you've been a satisfied customer. Let me just pull up your account here real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause, more typing) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. Michael, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, Michael Chen.

Agent: Awesome. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 500 plan at $79.99 a month. What's prompting the upgrade today? Are you having any issues with your current speeds, or...?

Customer: No, no, the service is great actually. It's just that... well, my company started having us work from home more permanently, and we've got a lot of people on our network now. My roommate moved in a couple months ago, and honestly, we're just streaming a lot more. Netflix, YouTube, all that. Sometimes things get a little sluggish when we're both doing heavy stuff at the same time, you know?

Agent: I totally get that. Multiple users and devices definitely add up fast. So we've got a couple of options for you. We have our Fiber 1 gig plan, which gives you one gigabit per second—that's obviously double what you're getting now. And then we also have our Fiber 2 gig plan if you want to really future-proof yourself.

Customer: Okay, um... what's the price difference? And like, would I notice that much of a difference with the one gig plan?

Agent: (typing sounds) Good question. So the Fiber 1 gig is $129.99 a month, and the 2 gig plan is $179.99 a month. As for whether you'd notice the difference, honestly, for what you're describing—streaming and work from home with two people—the 1 gig plan should handle that really comfortably. The 2 gig is more if you think you're going to add more people or do really bandwidth-intensive things like... 4K streaming, gaming, uploading large files regularly, that kind of thing.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the 1 gig is probably fine then. What about—do I need a new modem or anything like that? I don't want to get hit with a bunch of hidden fees.

Agent: That's a fair concern. So, yes, you will need a new modem to take advantage of the gigabit speeds. Our current modem supports those speeds. The good news is we'll swap that out for you at no charge, and we'll come out to install it for free as well. So no installation fees or anything like that.

Customer: Oh, nice. When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. What days work best for you? We typically have morning and afternoon appointment windows.

Customer: Um, I work from home, so pretty much any weekday works. Sooner is better, though.

Agent: (pause) Perfect. So I'm looking at next Tuesday or Wednesday. We have a morning slot, that's like 8 AM to 12 PM, or an afternoon slot from 12 to 4 PM. What would you prefer?

Customer: Tuesday afternoon would be great.

Agent: (typing sounds) Excellent. So I've got you scheduled for next Tuesday, October 17th, from 12 to 4 PM. A technician will come out and swap your modem and make sure everything's working perfectly. You'll receive a confirmation email and a text message with those details.

Customer: Perfect. So just to clarify—my bill is going to go from $79.99 to $129.99, right? And there's nothing else?

Agent: That's correct. The monthly rate goes up to $129.99. You will see a prorated charge on your next bill since we're making the change mid-cycle, but after that, it'll just be the $129.99 each month. And your service will be upgraded immediately once our technician completes the installation.

Customer: Okay, awesome. That sounds good. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?

Agent: Nope, we'll take care of everything. Just make sure someone's home between 12 and 4 PM on Tuesday to let the technician in. (pause) Oh, and one more thing—we're running a promotion right now where if you refer a friend or family member, you'll both get $50 off. Just something to keep in mind.

Customer: Oh, cool. I'll definitely tell my brother about that. He's been thinking about switching providers anyway.

Agent: (chuckles) Perfect. Well, I think we're all set here. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks so much for your help, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. Enjoy your upgraded speeds, and I hope your work from home runs a lot smoother now.

Customer: Thank you. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Take care!
