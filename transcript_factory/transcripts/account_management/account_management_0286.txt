Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've had Frontier for about three years now, and I'm pretty happy with the service, but I'm thinking I need to upgrade. My internet's been feeling a little slow lately.

Agent: Great, I appreciate that feedback. I'd be happy to help you explore our upgrade options. First, let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing... is this the account for 2341 Maple Street in Scottsdale?

Customer: Yes, that's the one.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, I'm speaking with Michael today?

Customer: Yep, Michael Chen.

Agent: Great, Michael. So I'm looking at your account here, and I see you're currently on our Fiber 500 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. And honestly, it's usually fine for what I do, but I've been working from home more lately, and I've got my wife's laptop going sometimes too, plus the kids are always streaming stuff. It just... it seems to be getting bogged down.

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually pretty common when you have multiple devices and people streaming simultaneously. The good news is we have some great options for you. Our Fiber 1 Gig plan would be a significant upgrade from your current speed, and it's designed exactly for households like yours.

Customer: Okay, so how much faster is that? And... what's the price gonna look like?

Agent: (pause) So you're currently getting up to 500 Megabits per second. The Fiber 1 Gig plan would give you up to 1 Gigabit per second—that's about twice the speed. As for pricing, I'm seeing here that we have a promotional rate right now. Your current plan is $79.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, so for the Fiber 1 Gig plan, I can get you set up at $99.99 a month for the first twelve months, and then it goes to our standard rate of $129.99 after that.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, so that's an extra twenty bucks a month to start with?

Agent: Right, so for the first year it would be $20 more per month. But you're getting double the speed, which should really help with everything you just described—the work-from-home situation, multiple streaming devices, all of that. And honestly, with what we're seeing in terms of household usage these days, a lot of customers find it's worth the investment.

Customer: Yeah, I mean... I guess that makes sense. Can I ask, is there any kind of bundle discount or anything? Like, do you guys do TV service?

Agent: We do offer TV bundles, but I should mention we're primarily focused on our Fiber internet services in your area. However, if you're interested in a bundle with our phone service, I can absolutely look into that for you. Do you currently have a Frontier phone line?

Customer: No, we don't. We just use our cell phones mostly. I was just thinking if there was like a package deal, it might offset some of the cost.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, to get the bundle discount, you'd need to add one of those services. But what I can do is check if there are any other promotions I might be able to apply to your account. (typing sounds) Let me see here... (pause) Actually, Michael, I'm seeing that I can extend your promotional pricing for an additional six months if you want to sign a 24-month term. That would keep you at $99.99 for eighteen months total instead of just twelve.

Customer: Oh, that's better actually. Yeah, I think I could do that. How soon would this take effect?

Agent: Great! So what I would do is process this upgrade right now, and we can have a technician come out to swap out your equipment—usually within the next 2 to 3 business days. The technician visit is complimentary, and they'll make sure everything's installed correctly and running optimally. It should only take about 30 to 45 minutes.

Customer: And I'll keep the same service address and everything?

Agent: Exactly, no change there. You'll keep your same address and the same account. We'll just be upgrading your modem and router to support the gigabit speeds. (pause) Do you have any preference on when you'd like the technician to come out? We have morning appointments, afternoon appointments...

Customer: Um, I'm working from home, so actually, pretty much anytime works for me. Just... not early, if possible? I'm not a morning person.

Agent: (chuckles) I totally get that. How about I schedule you for next Wednesday between 2 and 4 PM? That gives us a little window so the technician can definitely make it.

Customer: Yeah, Wednesday afternoon works great.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got that scheduled for you. You should get a confirmation text and email within the next couple hours with the details and a phone number you can call if you need to reschedule for any reason.

Customer: Great. So just to make sure I have this right—I'm upgrading to the gigabit plan, it's $99.99 for the first eighteen months, then it goes to $129.99 after that. And the technician is coming Wednesday afternoon.

Agent: That's exactly right. And Michael, I just want to mention, once you're on the gigabit plan, you should definitely see a pretty significant difference in your speeds, especially during peak usage times. Plus, you'll have more bandwidth to support all those devices. Most of our customers on this plan report being really happy with the upgrade.

Customer: That's good to hear. I think this is gonna help a lot. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. I appreciate it.

Agent: Awesome. Well, thanks for being a Frontier customer, Michael. We really appreciate your business. You have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now.
