Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, my name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet service. I've had the, um, the 100 megabit plan for like two years now and it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've actually got some great faster options available. Before we dive in, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this for the service at 2847 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're currently on our Gigabit Starter plan at 100 Mbps. Can you tell me a little bit about what's prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, streaming, or...?

Customer: Mostly working from home, actually. I've got video calls pretty much all day for work, and my spouse is usually streaming stuff on the TV at the same time. Plus we've got like three or four devices going at any given moment. It just seems like everything is buffering lately, you know?

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. Multiple video streams and heavy usage like that can definitely saturate a 100 Mbps connection. Let me pull up what we have available for your address. (pause) (typing sounds) Great news—you're in one of our fiber zones, so we can get you set up with some really fast speeds. We've got our 400 Mbps plan, our 800 Mbps plan, and our full Gigabit plan at 940 Mbps.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. So what's the price difference? I'm trying not to blow my budget here.

Agent: Absolutely, I hear you. So your current plan is $79.99 a month. Our 400 Mbps plan would be $99.99, the 800 Mbps is $129.99, and the Gigabit is $159.99. However, I do have a promotion running through the end of the month where we can knock $20 off the first year for new upgrades.

Customer: Hmm, so with that promotion the 400 would be...?

Agent: That would bring it down to $79.99 for the first year, so essentially the same price you're paying now but with four times the speed. After that, it goes to the regular $99.99.

Customer: That's actually pretty good. But do you think 400 would be enough for what I'm doing? You mentioned the video calls and streaming...

Agent: (pause) That's a fair question. For your use case—let's say you've got a video call using about 5 to 8 Mbps, streaming on the TV using another 5 to 25 depending on the quality, plus a few other devices—400 Mbps would definitely be comfortable. You'd have plenty of headroom. The 800 or the Gig would be overkill for most households, but some people like the extra cushion for future-proofing.

Customer: Right, right. I think 400 sounds good then. What about equipment? Do I need a new modem or anything?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check what equipment you're currently using. Looks like you have one of our older modems from about... two years ago when you signed up?

Customer: Yeah, I think so.

Agent: Okay, so with this upgrade to 400 Mbps, we'd need to swap that out for our newer equipment to take full advantage of the speeds. We'd ship that to you at no charge, and you'd just swap it out yourself—it's pretty straightforward. Takes like two minutes. We'd also include a new router.

Customer: Nice. And I don't have to pay for that?

Agent: Not at all. It's included with the upgrade. And just so you know, if you have any issues with the installation, our tech support team is available 24/7.

Customer: Great. Okay, so when could this start?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see... We can get your service upgraded as soon as tomorrow, and we'd ship the equipment out today. You should have it by... looks like Thursday of this week, so you'd have the equipment and instructions. Then it's really just a matter of plugging in the new modem and you're good to go.

Customer: Oh, that's fast! Perfect. And my current bill—do I need to do anything about that?

Agent: Nope, we'll handle all of that automatically. Your new rate will start on your next billing cycle, which is... (pause) (typing sounds) the 15th of next month. So you'll get one final bill at your current rate, and then the upgrade pricing kicks in.

Customer: Okay, cool. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Let me just review real quick. We're upgrading you from 100 Mbps to 400 Mbps, new equipment ships today, the promotion takes $20 off your first year, bringing it to $79.99 monthly, and service starts tomorrow. How does all that sound?

Customer: That sounds great, Derek. I'm happy with it.

Agent: Awesome! I'm going to go ahead and process this upgrade for you now. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got the work order submitted. You should get a confirmation email within the next couple minutes with all your details and tracking information for the equipment. Is the email on file still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And just one more thing—we're actually running a promotion on our premium channels package right now if you'd be interested in—

Customer: Oh, no, I'm good on that. I just need the internet.

Agent: No problem at all! Well, I think we're all set then. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks a lot, Derek.

Agent: Thank you so much for upgrading with Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You should see a big difference once that new equipment is installed. If you have any questions before it arrives, just give us a call back, okay?

Customer: Will do. Thanks again!

Agent: Take care!
