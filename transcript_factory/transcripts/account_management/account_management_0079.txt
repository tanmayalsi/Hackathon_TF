Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. My current speed is just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. We've definitely seen a lot of customers looking to upgrade lately. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 428 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm looking at your account now, and it shows you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've had it for... I don't know, maybe two years now? And it was fine when I first got it, but now with my kids doing remote schooling and my wife working from home, we're all constantly buffering and everything moves so slow.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. With multiple people streaming and video conferencing simultaneously, 100 megabits just isn't going to cut it. What kind of activities are you seeing the most issues with?

Customer: Like, my daughter's in online classes and when she's on Zoom calls, everything else just tanks. My wife's trying to upload files to the cloud, and it's taking forever. And then if I try to stream anything, forget about it.

Agent: Right, right. So it sounds like you need something with more bandwidth. Good news is, we have some great options for you. We currently offer Fiber 200, Fiber 500, or our Fiber Gig plan, which gives you up to one gigabit per second. Have you heard about any of those?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so what's the difference? And more importantly, what's the price going to be?

Agent: Great questions. So Fiber 200 would essentially double your speed to 200 meg, and that's usually enough for a household with multiple users doing moderate streaming and working from home. Then Fiber 500 gives you, well, 500 meg, which is ideal for heavier usage. And the Gig plan is our top tier—one thousand meg per second.

Customer: That sounds... that's a lot. What does that actually mean in practical terms? Like, what can I actually do with it?

Agent: (chuckles) That's a fair question. Honestly, with the Gig plan, you could have multiple people streaming 4K video simultaneously, doing video conferences, downloading large files, gaming—all at the same time without any lag or buffering. It's really future-proof, especially if your usage needs grow.

Customer: Okay, and the pricing?

Agent: Let me check the current promotions we have available. (typing sounds) So right now, Fiber 200 would be $49.99 a month for the first year, then $59.99 after that. Fiber 500 is $69.99 the first year, then $79.99. And the Fiber Gig plan is $89.99 for your first year, then $99.99 going forward.

Customer: Hmm. That's more than what I'm paying now, obviously.

Agent: What are you currently paying monthly, if you don't mind me asking?

Customer: I think it's like... $39.99? Or maybe $45? I don't really look at it that closely.

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, so you're at $45.99 per month. So there would be an increase. But I will say, we do have a promotion running right now where if you upgrade today, I can lock in the promotional rate for two years instead of one. So you'd stay at $69.99 for Fiber 500 for the full two years.

Customer: Really? Two years?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. It's a limited-time offer we're running right now. So that could save you a bit compared to the standard year-one, year-two pricing.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... I think Fiber 500 sounds good. That should handle everything we need, right?

Agent: I think that would be a great fit for your situation, honestly. You'll definitely see a major improvement from where you are now.

Customer: What about installation? Do I need to have someone come out?

Agent: Good question. So with the upgrade, we typically do need to send a technician out to make sure everything's optimized on your end and to check the fiber connection to your home. That's usually at no charge for upgrades. We have availability... let me see here... (typing sounds) We have next Tuesday or Thursday available. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Um, Tuesday is better for me. What time range?

Agent: We have a morning window between 8 AM and 12 PM, or an afternoon window from 1 PM to 5 PM.

Customer: I'll do the afternoon window. One to five.

Agent: Perfect. So that's Thursday— wait, you said Tuesday, right?

Customer: Yes, Tuesday. The afternoon.

Agent: Right, sorry, got it. Tuesday, 1 PM to 5 PM. The technician will come out, should take about an hour or so. Do you have any other equipment we need to discuss, or are you good with your current router?

Customer: Oh, um... can I use my existing router, or do I need a new one?

Agent: That's a great question. What router model do you have?

Customer: I... I'm not really sure. It's just the one you guys gave us when we set up the service.

Agent: That's fine. The tech can evaluate it on Tuesday and let you know if we need to upgrade you. Most likely, for the speeds you'll be getting, we might recommend our newer router, but we can discuss that when they're there.

Customer: Okay. And there's no setup fee or anything?

Agent: (pause) There is a one-time installation fee of $99, but again, that's typically waived for upgrades. Let me just confirm that's applied here. (typing sounds) Yes, I can waive that for you as part of the promotion.

Customer: Oh, great! Okay, that's good.

Agent: Excellent. So let me just confirm everything. You're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500 at $69.99 per month, locked in for two years. Installation on Tuesday between 1 and 5 PM, with the fee waived. And we'll have the tech evaluate your equipment. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect. When will the service actually be live?

Agent: It should activate on Monday, so you'll have the speeds available before the technician comes out on Tuesday. You might want to restart your modem when you wake up Monday morning to make sure everything's up to date.

Customer: Okay, got it. And I should get some kind of confirmation?

Agent: Absolutely. We'll send you an email confirmation right away with your appointment details and all the information about the service change. And then you'll get a call or text reminder on Monday before the technician comes out Tuesday.

Customer: Perfect. I think that's everything. Thanks for the help!

Agent: You're very welcome! I really appreciate your business, and I think you're going to be really happy with the upgrade. If you have any questions before Tuesday, you can always call us back. The number's on your invoice. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think we're all set!

Agent: Great! Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you Tuesday!

Customer: Thanks, bye!

Agent: Bye!
