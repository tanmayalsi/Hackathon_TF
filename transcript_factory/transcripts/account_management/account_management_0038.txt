# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call - Internet Upgrade

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet. I've got the basic plan right now and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've actually upgraded our network in a lot of areas recently, so you might have some great options available to you. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got it here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our 100 megabits per second plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. My kids are doing school online now, and with my wife working from home too, everyone's trying to use the internet at the same time. It just gets really slow, especially in the evenings.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. A hundred megs can definitely get congested with multiple users. (pause) Good news though—at your address, we actually have fiber availability now. You could upgrade to our 500 meg plan, or even our gig plan if you wanted to go all out.

Customer: Really? Fiber? I didn't know that was available in my area. How much more is that going to run me?

Agent: Great question. So your current plan is $59.99 a month, right? (typing sounds) The 500 meg fiber plan is $79.99 for the first year, and then it goes to $89.99 after that. That gives you speeds up to 500 megabits per second. Or, if you want the full gig—that's 1,000 megs—that's $99.99 for the first year, then $119.99.

Customer: Hmm, okay. And what's the difference gonna be for me in real life? Like, is 500 gonna be enough, or should I go with the gig?

Agent: (pause) That's a fair question. For what you described—multiple people streaming and working from home—honestly, the 500 meg plan is probably gonna handle that really well. You'd have plenty of bandwidth. The gig plan is more if you're... I don't know, doing heavy 4K streaming, online gaming, large file uploads, that kind of thing. But for your situation, I'd probably recommend the 500 meg.

Customer: Okay, that sounds reasonable. Is there any kind of installation fee or anything like that?

Agent: Let me check what we can do for you here. (typing sounds) Since you're an existing customer upgrading, I can waive the installation fee. There's usually a hundred dollar charge for the fiber install, but I can take that off for you. And actually, I'm showing a promotion right now—if you sign a two-year agreement, I can lock in that $79.99 for the full two years instead of it going up after year one.

Customer: Oh, that's... that's actually pretty good. Yeah, I think I'd want to do that then.

Agent: Awesome. So just to recap what we're looking at: upgrading you to our 500 megabits fiber plan at $79.99 per month for two years, waived installation fee, and you'll have the speeds up to 500 megs for your whole household. How does that sound?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds great. When could you guys get that installed?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what our availability looks like. (pause) Looks like we could get a technician out to you... we have an opening this Saturday, or if you prefer weekday, we've got Tuesday or Wednesday of next week available.

Customer: This Saturday works for me. What time would that be?

Agent: Saturday we have a morning window, between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm scheduling that now. The technician will bring the new modem and fiber equipment, and it should take about an hour to get everything set up. You'll want to make sure you have easy access to your main line coming into the house.

Customer: Got it. Do I need to do anything before they come out?

Agent: Nope, just make sure someone's home to let them in. They'll handle everything else. Oh, and just so you know, there will be a brief outage—maybe like 10, 15 minutes tops—while they're transferring over to the new fiber line. So just keep that in mind.

Customer: Okay, that's good to know. And I'm all set then? I don't have to call back or anything?

Agent: You're all set. (pause) Let me just verify your email address so we can send you a confirmation and some info about the installation. I'm showing [inaudible]@outlook.com?

Customer: No, that's not... it's jen.morrison.1987@gmail.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. Jen with an E-N, right?

Customer: Yep.

Agent: Perfect. We'll send you all the details to that email, including a confirmation number for your appointment on Saturday. You should get that within the next few minutes actually. And hey, just so you know, if you need to reschedule for any reason, you can call us back or do it through your account online.

Customer: Great, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome! Just one more thing—I'm gonna add you to our Frontier Rewards program at no extra cost. You'll earn points on your bill that you can use toward service credits or other rewards. You should see that show up in your account by tomorrow.

Customer: Oh nice, that's cool. I didn't know about that.

Agent: Yep, it's a nice little benefit. (pause) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again, Marcus.

Agent: You got it. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see you Saturday morning. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
