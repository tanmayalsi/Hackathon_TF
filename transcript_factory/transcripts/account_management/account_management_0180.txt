Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I currently have the 100 meg plan, and I'm just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've actually seen a lot of customers in your situation, especially with more people working from home these days. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Okay, so I'm looking at your account here. You've been with us since 2019, and you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan. That's great that you've been a loyal customer. What's been happening that's making you feel like you need more speed?

Customer: Well, my daughter just started doing remote learning, and my wife is working from home three days a week now. And honestly, when they're both on Zoom calls at the same time, everything just... it gets really sluggish. Plus, my son is always streaming something or gaming, and I feel like we're just constantly running into issues.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. Multiple video calls combined with streaming and gaming can definitely max out a 100 meg connection. How many devices are typically online at the same time during peak times?

Customer: Oh, probably five or six? Like, we've got three computers, a couple of phones, the smart TV, and... yeah. It adds up.

Agent: Absolutely. So for your household situation, I'd recommend looking at our Frontier Fiber 500 plan. That would give you plenty of headroom for multiple simultaneous activities without the lag you're experiencing. We also have a Fiber 1 gig option if you want to really future-proof your setup.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference in price between those two?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Great question. So right now, your 100 meg plan is $59.99 a month. Our Fiber 500 plan is $79.99 a month, so that's a $20 increase. The Fiber 1 gig is $99.99 a month, so that would be a $40 increase.

Customer: Hmm, so the 500 is probably the sweet spot then? I don't really need a full gig.

Agent: For your situation, honestly? Yeah, I think the 500 plan would be perfect. You'd have more than enough for everyone to do their thing without any interference. And you wouldn't be overbuying on something you don't need.

Customer: That sounds good. How quickly could you make that switch happen?

Agent: Well, the good news is you're already on fiber infrastructure at your location, so we don't need to do any installation work. I can push this change through right now, and it would be effective... (typing sounds) ...it would take effect on your next billing cycle, which looks like it would be the 15th of next month. So you'll have about two weeks from now.

Customer: Oh wow, really? So I don't need a technician or anything?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. Since you're already on our fiber network, it's just a provisioning change on our end. Your equipment and everything stays exactly the same.

Customer: That's fantastic. Um, is there anything else I should know? Any promotions or anything?

Agent: (pause) Let me check what we have available for upgrades. (typing sounds) Okay, so normally I'd offer a promotional rate, but actually, you're already at a pretty great price point with your loyalty discount applied. So the $79.99 I quoted is already the best rate we have for that plan for existing customers like yourself.

Customer: Okay, fair enough. Yeah, let's go ahead and do it.

Agent: Perfect. So just to confirm everything—you're upgrading from the Frontier Fiber 100 plan to our Frontier Fiber 500 plan. Your new rate will be $79.99 per month, effective on your next billing date, November 15th. And you don't need any technician visit. Is that all correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: Excellent. I'm processing that change for you right now. (typing sounds) And... done. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour to the email address we have on file, which is [inaudible]. Is that still current?

Customer: Um, yeah, that's good.

Agent: Great. And just so you know, if you experience any issues after the change takes effect, we have 24/7 customer support. You can call us back, or you can reach out through the Frontier app if that's easier for you.

Customer: Sounds good. Do I need to do anything on my end before the 15th?

Agent: Nope, nothing at all. Just keep doing what you're doing. Everything will be automatic on our side.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks so much, Marcus. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. Enjoy that faster internet. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thank you again.

Agent: Have a great day, and thanks for calling Frontier Communications!

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
