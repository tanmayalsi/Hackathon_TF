Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan is, I think it's the 100 megabit plan, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've been seeing a lot of customers making that move. Let me pull up your account really quick here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 2847 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. Okay, so I'm looking at your account now. You've been with us for about three years, and you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. That's actually fantastic that you're looking to upgrade. What's driving the need for more speed? Are you working from home, or...?

Customer: Yeah, so I work from home now, and my family streams a lot. We've got, like, three people on video calls at the same time sometimes, and then my kids are doing online school, and it just gets really slow. We'll get buffering, and it's just frustrating, you know?

Agent: Oh, absolutely. Yeah, that's a pretty common situation, especially these days. So with multiple video conferences and streaming simultaneously, you're definitely pushing the limits of 100 megs. We have a couple of options that could work really well for you. We have our Fiber 300 plan, and then we also have our Fiber 500 plan. The 300 would give you plenty of headroom for what you're describing. The 500 is, um, really for people who are doing a lot of 4K streaming or if you have like eight or more devices connected.

Customer: What's the price difference?

Agent: (pause) Good question. Let me check what we can offer you. So your current plan, I'm seeing you're at $59.99 a month. For the Fiber 300, we can get you that at $79.99 a month. And the Fiber 500 would be $99.99.

Customer: Hmm. So that's a $20 increase for the 300?

Agent: That's right. Now, I should mention we do have a promotion running right now for existing customers upgrading their service. We can lock in the 300 plan at $69.99 for the first twelve months. So it's really just a $10 increase right out of the gate, and then it goes to the regular $79.99 after that year.

Customer: Oh, that's better. So just to be clear, it's $10 more for a year, and then it goes up to $80?

Agent: Correct, yes. And that includes the same equipment rental fee you're currently paying. We'd be upgrading your modem to our latest fiber modem, which is compatible with those higher speeds, so that's... that's included at no extra cost for the upgrade.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I think the 300 plan makes sense for us. But I do have a question—do I have to pay anything upfront, like an installation fee or anything?

Agent: That's a great question. Since you already have fiber infrastructure at your property, there's no installation fee for the upgrade. It's really just a straightforward service upgrade. We'll send you the new modem—it should arrive within 3 to 5 business days—and you'll just swap it out with your current one. It takes like five minutes, honestly.

Customer: That sounds easy enough. And, um, will there be any downtime? Like, will my internet go down during the switch?

Agent: There will be a brief moment when you power down the old modem and power up the new one, maybe thirty seconds to a minute, but that's it. You'll be back online and running at 300 megs.

Customer: Perfect. Okay, I'm ready to upgrade. What do I need to do?

Agent: Fantastic! (typing sounds) So I'm going to go ahead and process this upgrade for you right now. Let me just confirm everything one more time. You're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, promotional rate of $69.99 for twelve months, then $79.99 after that. Your service address is 2847 Maple Drive, and I'm going to keep your phone number the same, which is 555-0147. Does all of that sound correct?

Customer: Yes, that all looks right.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) And I'll be emailing you a confirmation receipt to the email address we have on file, which is... [inaudible] ...@gmail.com. Is that still the best email for you?

Customer: Actually, can you update that? It's jsmith.family@gmail.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) jsmith.family@gmail.com. Got it. Thank you for that. Okay, so your upgrade is all set and locked in. Your new modem should arrive by... let's say by next Wednesday at the latest. You'll get a tracking number via email, and then once you receive it, just follow the simple instructions in the box, or you can always call us back if you need any help with the setup.

Customer: Great. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Um, one thing I'd mention—just make sure you power down your current modem before you power up the new one. And your speeds should bump up immediately once it's activated. You can always test your speeds on our website or just by using a speed test tool. If for some reason you're not hitting those 300 megs, just give us a call back and we can troubleshoot.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and thanks for upgrading with us. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Perfect. Have a great day, and welcome to Fiber 300!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
