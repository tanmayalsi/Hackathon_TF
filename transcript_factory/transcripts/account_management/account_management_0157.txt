Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan and I'm thinking about upgrading. My bill's been going up and I thought, you know, might as well get better service out of it.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're on the 500 meg plan currently. What's prompting the upgrade today? Are you experiencing any issues, or is it more about just wanting faster speeds?

Customer: Um, mostly just faster speeds. I work from home now, and my wife's been streaming a lot more. We've got like three kids who are all doing remote school stuff too, so there's just... a lot happening on the network, you know?

Agent: Oh yeah, that makes total sense. Multiple devices streaming and video conferencing will definitely eat up bandwidth pretty quickly. (pause) So we actually have a couple of options for you. We have our 1 gig plan, which is our top tier fiber offering, or we have 750 meg which is kind of a nice middle ground. Have you heard about our gig service before?

Customer: Um, I think so? Like that's the one gig speed, right? That seems... isn't that overkill for a house?

Agent: (chuckles) That's a question I get all the time, actually. So it definitely depends on your usage, but with what you're describing—multiple work calls, streaming, kids doing school online—the gig plan actually handles all of that simultaneously without any slowdown. Plus, future-proofing is always nice. You don't have to worry about outgrowing it for a while.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. What's the pricing on that?

Agent: (typing) So right now, we have a promotion running. The gig plan is $79.99 a month for the first twelve months, and then it goes to our regular rate of $99.99 after that. And that's with the same equipment you're using now—no installation fees or anything like that since you're already a customer.

Customer: Oh, okay. And what's the 750 meg option?

Agent: The 750 meg is $64.99 for the first year, then $84.99 after. It's a nice option if you want to step up without going all the way to gig. Honestly though, given what you've told me about your household, I'd recommend the gig. You're getting a pretty good deal right now with the promotional pricing.

Customer: How much more is it though? Like, what's the actual difference?

Agent: So we're talking $15 a month difference during the promo period. That's like fifty cents a day for basically unlimited capacity.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. That does sound reasonable. Can I... do I need a technician to come out, or...?

Agent: Nope, no technician needed. Since you're already connected with fiber infrastructure, we can push the upgrade remotely. You'll get a confirmation email once we make the change, and you should see the speed increase within about an hour. The modem you have now will handle the gig speeds just fine.

Customer: Perfect. Yeah, let's do that. The gig plan.

Agent: Excellent choice. (typing) Okay, so I'm going to add that to your account right now. Let me just confirm a couple details. Your service address is still 2847 Pinewood Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. (typing) And the email on file is still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Uh, actually, it's [inaudible]@yahoo.com now. I changed it like six months ago.

Agent: Ah, okay. Let me update that. (typing) Can you spell that out for me?

Customer: S-A-M-D-O-E-1-9-8-8-@-Y-A-H-O-O dot com.

Agent: (typing) Perfect. Got it updated. So to recap: we're upgrading you from the 500 meg plan to our 1 gig plan at $79.99 monthly for the first twelve months. Your bill will process normally on the 15th of next month, and the new rate will reflect then. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. When should I expect the speed increase?

Agent: You'll get that confirmation email within the next 15 minutes or so, and the speeds should be live within an hour. If for some reason you don't see it after a couple hours, just give us a call back or restart your modem—that usually does the trick.

Customer: Great. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for sticking with Frontier, and enjoy those speeds!

Customer: Will do. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day!
