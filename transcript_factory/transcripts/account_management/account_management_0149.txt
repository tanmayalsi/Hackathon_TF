# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore, honestly.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account for a residential address in Portland. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So, I'm showing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that what you have now?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. It's been fine for a while, but I've been working from home more often lately, and my family's streaming stuff constantly. It just feels slow sometimes, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. That's something we hear a lot, especially with multiple devices running at once. (pause) What kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you thinking something faster, or... what's your main concern?

Customer: I'm not sure exactly, but I know I need something faster. I was looking at your website and I saw you have like a 300 plan or something?

Agent: Yes, we do. So we have a few options that might work well for you. We have Fiber 300, which is our most popular mid-tier plan, and then we also have Fiber 500 if you're really looking to max things out. The 300 would give you speeds up to 300 megabits per second, and the 500 would be up to 500. (pause) With your family streaming and you working from home, the 300 would probably be a really solid upgrade for you.

Customer: Okay, how much more would that be per month?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check the pricing for you. What's your current monthly payment if you don't mind me asking?

Customer: I think it's like... $59 a month? Maybe $60?

Agent: Okay, so with Fiber 300, I can get you set up at $74.99 per month for the first year, and then it would be $84.99 after that. We also have a promotional bundle if you're interested in TV service, but I know a lot of people are going the streaming route now anyway.

Customer: No, just internet for me. So it's $74.99 for the first year... and then what, it goes up?

Agent: Right, yes. So after the promotional year, it would be $84.99. Now, the good news is, we can lock in that renewal rate, so you wouldn't have any surprise increases after that point.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's not too bad. What's the difference between the 300 and the 500?

Agent: Good question. So the 500 plan would be $89.99 per month for the first year—

Customer: Wow, okay.

Agent: —and $99.99 after that. The main difference is just the speed capacity. The 300 you'll get up to 300 megabits, and with the 500, you're getting up to 500 megabits. For most households, even with heavy streaming and multiple devices, the 300 is usually plenty. But if you do a lot of large file transfers, video conferencing, online gaming, that kind of thing, the 500 might be worth it.

Customer: I do video calls for work pretty regularly, but I don't think I need the super high end. I think 300 should be fine.

Agent: That sounds perfect for your situation. (typing sounds) And just to confirm, your service address is still the same? 7428 Willamette Street?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So I can get you upgraded to Fiber 300 for $74.99 per month. We won't need a technician visit since you're already on fiber infrastructure, so the upgrade can happen pretty quickly. You should see the change take effect... (pause) probably within 24 hours, typically sooner actually.

Customer: Oh, cool. I don't have to do anything?

Agent: Nope, nothing on your end. We'll just push it through from our side. Your modem's already compatible with the higher speeds, so you're all set. You might want to restart your modem and router once or twice over the next day just to make sure everything's syncing up properly, but that's optional.

Customer: Okay, awesome. When does this start?

Agent: (typing sounds) I can activate this for you right now if you'd like. It'll process immediately, and like I said, it should be active within 24 hours. Is that something you want me to go ahead with?

Customer: Yeah, let's do it. That would be great.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just get a couple pieces of information to confirm everything, and then we'll get you all set. I have your name as [inaudible] Thompson on the account?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: And your email address is still thompson.michael.1984@email.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I've processed your upgrade to Fiber 300 starting today. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details of your new plan, your new rate, everything. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. This is great, thanks a lot.

Agent: You're welcome. I really appreciate your business, and thanks for choosing Frontier. If you have any issues after the upgrade goes through or if you need anything else, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
