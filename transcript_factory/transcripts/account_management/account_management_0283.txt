# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My speeds are just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here. And what's the best name to have on file?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Great, James. I've got you here. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 200 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Two hundred megs download, right? That was fine for a while, but now with working from home full-time and my kids doing online school, it's just... it's not keeping up.

Agent: I totally understand. That's something we hear a lot these days. So what kind of speeds are you looking for?

Customer: Honestly, I'm not really sure. What do you recommend? Like, how much higher can I go?

Agent: (pause) Great question. So with our Fiber service in your area, we have several options. You could upgrade to our Fiber 500 plan, which gives you 500 megabits download. Or we also offer our Fiber Gig plan, which is a full gigabit per second. That's 1,000 megs.

Customer: Wow, a gig? That seems like... isn't that overkill?

Agent: Not necessarily. Especially if you've got multiple people on the network at the same time doing bandwidth-heavy activities. That includes things like video conferencing, streaming, gaming, remote work... With the Fiber 500, you'd have plenty of headroom for most households, but if you want to future-proof yourself and have everyone on the network simultaneously without any slowdowns, the Gig plan is really where it's at.

Customer: (pause) And what's the price difference?

Agent: So your Fiber 200 is currently at $79.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: OK, so the Fiber 500 would be $109.99 per month, and the Fiber Gig is $149.99 per month. Now, here's the good news—since you're an existing customer and you're looking to upgrade, I can actually offer you our loyalty pricing. That brings the Fiber 500 down to $99.99 for the first 12 months, and the Fiber Gig down to $129.99 for the first 12 months.

Customer: Oh, nice. And after 12 months?

Agent: After 12 months, it would go to the regular pricing, but we can always revisit your plan before that happens to make sure you're getting the best rate available at that time.

Customer: OK, that's good to know. What about installation? Do I need someone to come out?

Agent: That's a great question. Since you're already a Fiber customer, we'd just need to upgrade your modem and router to support the higher speeds. We have two options: we can either ship those to you with easy self-installation instructions—it usually takes about 15 minutes—or we can schedule a technician to come out and do it for you. There would be a $99.99 service charge for the technician visit if you go that route.

Customer: How long would shipping take?

Agent: (typing sounds) If you place the order today, we can get the equipment to you in about 5 to 7 business days, and you'd be up and running pretty quickly after that.

Customer: Hmm, and if I do the self-install, is there any risk of messing it up?

Agent: Not really. The instructions are pretty straightforward, and honestly, most people have no problem with it. But if you do run into any issues, we have 24/7 technical support, and they can walk you through it step by step.

Customer: (pause) I think... yeah, I think I'd rather have the technician come out just to be safe. I'm not the most tech-savvy person.

Agent: That's totally fine. I can absolutely schedule that for you. When would work best? We have availability this week or we can look at next week.

Customer: Um, this week would be better if you have it. Maybe like Thursday or Friday afternoon?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see... We have Thursday between 12 and 5 PM, or Friday morning between 8 AM and 1 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Thursday afternoon is perfect.

Agent: Excellent. So I've got you down for Thursday, 12 to 5 PM. The technician will bring the new equipment and get you all set up. Is the number on file good to send you a confirmation and any updates?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap everything, James—you're upgrading from Fiber 200 to Fiber Gig at $129.99 per month for the first 12 months. The technician will be out Thursday between 12 and 5 PM. Your new equipment will be set up, and you should be experiencing those gigabit speeds by Thursday evening.

Customer: That sounds great, Derek. And I'm going to see faster speeds right away, yeah?

Agent: Absolutely. The jump from 200 to 1,000 megs is pretty dramatic. You're going to notice a huge difference, especially with multiple devices on the network. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks a lot for walking me through all the options.

Agent: My pleasure, James. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
