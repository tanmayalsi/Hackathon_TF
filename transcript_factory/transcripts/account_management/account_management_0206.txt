Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet service. My current plan is just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your phone number or account number, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Jennifer Mitchell.

Agent: (pause) Great, Jennifer. I'm showing here you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've had it for... I think about two years now? And honestly, it's been fine for a while, but with everyone working from home and streaming now, it's just gotten really slow. My partner's always complaining about buffering during his meetings.

Agent: I totally understand. A lot of our customers are experiencing that same thing. The good news is that upgrading is super simple. So, what kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you interested in our Fiber 300, which gives you 300 megabits per second, or maybe our Fiber 500 plan?

Customer: Um... what's the difference between those two? I mean, I know 500 is faster, but is it worth the extra cost?

Agent: That's a great question. So the Fiber 300 is perfect if you have, say, three to four devices streaming at once, or if you're doing video calls while someone else is browsing. The Fiber 500 gives you more headroom—it's ideal if you have a lot of devices connected at the same time, or if you want that extra buffer for multiple high-definition streams.

Customer: How much more are we talking? Price-wise?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so your current Fiber 100 plan is $79.99 a month. The Fiber 300 would be $99.99 a month, and the Fiber 500 is $129.99. And I should mention, we have a promotion running right now where I can lock in the Fiber 300 plan for your first twelve months at $89.99.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad. So that's a $10 increase for the first year if I do the 300?

Agent: Exactly. And after that first year, it goes to the regular $99.99. But you're getting triple the speeds. Honestly, given what you described about the buffering issues, I'd recommend at least the 300.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I think the 300 with that promotional rate sounds good. How quickly can that be switched over?

Agent: Great choice! So, the good news is that since you're already on our Fiber network, the upgrade can be completed immediately. You won't need a technician to come out or anything. You'll see the speed increase basically right away once we make the change in the system.

Customer: Really? That's awesome. I was worried it would take like a week or something.

Agent: Nope, we're talking within the next few minutes. (typing sounds) And I'm just going to confirm a couple things here. Your service address is 447 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And your current modem—do you know if it's one of ours or did you provide your own?

Customer: I think it's one of yours. It's the Frontier-branded one anyway.

Agent: (pause) Excellent. That modem is definitely capable of handling the Fiber 300 speeds, so you're all set there. No equipment changes needed.

Customer: Great!

Agent: Alright, so let me just go ahead and process this upgrade for you. The new plan will take effect immediately, and you should receive a new billing statement reflecting the promotional rate starting with your next billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. When will I see the speed increase? Like, should I restart my router or anything?

Agent: You know, that's actually a good idea. Give your modem and router about thirty seconds off the power when we're done here, just to let them refresh. After that, you should be good to go. You might notice the difference right away, especially during those peak times when your partner's on his calls.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you so much, Marcus. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: Nope, that's everything!

Agent: Wonderful. Well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
