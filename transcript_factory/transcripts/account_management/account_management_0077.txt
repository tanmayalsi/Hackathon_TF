Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet service. I've had the same plan for like... three years now and I think it's time for something faster.

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing) Okay, I'm seeing an account here under the name... is this Jennifer Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect! So Jennifer, I'm looking at your current plan here. It looks like you're on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. A hundred megs, I think?

Agent: That's right. One hundred megabits per second download. And just out of curiosity, what's prompting the upgrade today? Are you working from home, streaming, or...?

Customer: Oh, both actually. I've been working from home full-time for about a year now, and my husband, he games a lot. So like, when he's playing online and I'm on Zoom calls, things just get... (trails off) ...it gets pretty slow sometimes. Plus the kids are doing school from home too, so it's just a lot of people on the internet at once.

Agent: (sympathetically) Oh man, yeah, that's a pretty common situation. Especially with multiple devices. A hundred megs can definitely struggle with that kind of load. The good news is we have some great options that would work really well for your household. We've got our Fiber 200 plan, and then we also have Fiber 500, which is actually our most popular upgrade for people in your situation.

Customer: What's the difference in price between those?

Agent: (typing) Good question. So your current Fiber 100 is... let me see here... you're at about $69.99 a month, right?

Customer: Yeah, around there. Maybe $70 with taxes.

Agent: Right, so with taxes included, yeah. The Fiber 200 would run you $89.99 a month, and the Fiber 500 would be $129.99 a month. However... (pause) ...hold on one second, let me check something.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (background hold music faintly) (pause) (typing sounds resume) Alright, so I'm looking at our current promotions, and I actually have some good news for you. We're running a promotion right now where if you upgrade to Fiber 500, we can lock you in at $99.99 a month for the first 12 months. After that it would go to the regular $129.99, but that's a pretty solid savings.

Customer: Wait, really? So that's $30 less than the regular price?

Agent: Exactly. It's a limited-time offer, so that's pretty fortunate timing on your part. And honestly, with your household setup, the 500 megs would give you plenty of bandwidth. You'd be able to have multiple video calls going, someone streaming, gaming—all at the same time without any real slowdown.

Customer: That sounds amazing. Um, how quick can you upgrade me? Like, do I have to wait?

Agent: Great question. So typically we can have a technician out to install the necessary equipment within... (typing) ...looks like we have availability starting tomorrow, actually. Or there's several slots throughout this week. Would one of those work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Really? That's fast. Um, let me think about my schedule... (pause) ...what time tomorrow?

Agent: We have a morning window, that would be between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have an afternoon window from 1 PM to 5 PM.

Customer: I think morning would be better for me. Let's do that.

Agent: Perfect! (typing) I'm going to get you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 and 12. And just so you know, the technician will just be swapping out some equipment—it's pretty quick, usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes. You might experience a brief interruption in service during that time, maybe a few minutes.

Customer: That's fine. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: (pause) Let me think... oh, one thing—do you have a modem currently, or do you rent one from us?

Customer: I think I have my own? I'm pretty sure I bought one a few years ago.

Agent: Okay, well, the technician can check that when they come out. For the 500 meg service, you'll want to make sure you have a modem that's compatible. The technician will make sure everything is set up properly. If your current modem isn't compatible, we do have rental options starting at $12.99 a month, or you can always purchase your own if you prefer.

Customer: Okay, I'll ask the technician about it.

Agent: Sounds good. And just to confirm—I'm showing that the promotional rate of $99.99 a month for the first 12 months will be reflected on your next billing cycle. Your next bill will come about two weeks from now, so you should see it then. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you!

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today, Jennifer?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm really happy with this.

Agent: Awesome! Well, I really appreciate your business, and thank you for choosing Frontier. We'll see you tomorrow morning. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks so much!

Agent: Bye now!
