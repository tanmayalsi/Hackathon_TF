Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've had Frontier for about three years now and my speeds have been pretty slow lately.

Agent: I appreciate you sticking with us! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing your account now. So you're currently on our 100 Mbps fiber plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. We've got four people in the house now, and with everyone working from home and streaming, it's just... it's not cutting it anymore. My kids are always complaining about lag when they're online gaming.

Agent: I totally understand. A hundred megs can get stretched thin with that many people online at once. The good news is we've got some excellent fiber options available at your address. What kind of speeds are you thinking about? Are you looking at something like our 300 Mbps plan, or were you interested in going even higher?

Customer: Hmm, I'm not really sure what I need. What would you recommend?

Agent: Well, it depends on your usage, but with four people in the household and multiple devices streaming and gaming simultaneously, I'd honestly recommend at least our 300 Mbps plan. That's going to give you plenty of bandwidth and pretty much eliminate those lag issues your kids are experiencing. We also have a 500 Mbps plan if you want more headroom for the future.

Customer: What's the price difference between those two?

Agent: (typing sounds) Good question. So the 300 Mbps plan is $79.99 per month for the first year, then it goes to $99.99 after that. The 500 Mbps plan is $109.99 for the first year, then $129.99. So it's about thirty bucks more per month on the intro rate.

Customer: Wow, okay. That's... that's a bit more than I was expecting.

Agent: I hear you. But here's the thing—since you've been a loyal customer for three years, I can actually apply a loyalty discount for you. Let me see what I can do... (pause, typing sounds) Alright, so I can lock in the 300 Mbps plan at $69.99 for the first year with a two-year commitment. How does that sound?

Customer: That's better. That's like, what, ten bucks more than what I'm paying now?

Agent: Exactly. And you're nearly tripling your speeds, so you're getting a lot more value for that extra ten dollars. Plus, with the two-year commitment, there's no price increase after year one during that period.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that actually seems pretty reasonable. Do I need to do anything for the upgrade? Will I need a new modem or anything?

Agent: Great question. So your current equipment should actually be compatible with the higher speeds, but I'd recommend doing a modem refresh anyway since yours has been in service for a while. I can ship you a new modem at no charge, and it takes about five to seven business days to arrive. You'd just swap it out—it's really simple, just plug and play basically.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. What about installation? Do someone need to come out?

Agent: In most cases, no. Since you already have fiber to your home, it's typically just a self-install with the new modem. However, if you run into any issues or want a technician to come out and make sure everything's running optimally, we can definitely arrange that. There would be a $99 service call fee for that, but I can waive it if you'd like.

Customer: No, I think I can handle swapping out a modem. Let's skip that.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, so let me just confirm the details here. You want to upgrade to our 300 Mbps fiber plan at $69.99 for the first year with a two-year commitment. We'll ship out a complimentary modem, and you'll do a self-install. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. When would all this take effect?

Agent: So the new service plan takes effect tomorrow—that's when we'll process the upgrade and your new rate will kick in on your next billing cycle. The modem should arrive by... (pause, typing sounds) ...next Thursday at the latest. Once you receive it and swap it out, you'll immediately get those faster speeds.

Customer: Alright, perfect. And I'll just see it on my next bill?

Agent: Exactly. You'll see the new rate reflected on your next statement. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help, Derek. I appreciate the loyalty discount.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for being such a great customer. We really do appreciate your business. If you have any questions once you get that modem, just give us a call back. Our support team is available 24/7. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
