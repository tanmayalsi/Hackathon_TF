Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've had the same plan for like... I don't know, three years? And it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've actually upgraded a lot of our speeds recently, so you might have some great new options available. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the address on file at 2841 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So I'm looking here and I see you're currently on our 200 megabit per second plan. Is that the one you're looking to upgrade from?

Customer: Yeah, that one. Honestly, my kids are doing remote school stuff and I'm working from home now, so we're constantly buffering and everything's just slow. We've got like five devices running at once usually, and it's just frustrating, you know?

Agent: Oh, I hear you. That's actually really common right now, especially with multiple people streaming and working simultaneously. So for your situation, I'd definitely recommend looking at our Gig plan—that's one gigabit per second—or if you want something a little more in the middle, we have a 500 meg option that's pretty popular.

Customer: What's the difference in price between those?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so right now with our current promotion, the 500 meg plan is $79.99 per month for the first year, and then it goes to $89.99 after that. And the Gig plan is $99.99 for the first year, then $109.99 going forward.

Customer: Hmm. How much am I paying now?

Agent: Let me see... you're currently at $69.99 per month for the 200 meg.

Customer: So it's like an extra ten bucks for the 500, or thirty for the Gig?

Agent: Exactly. And honestly, with your situation—multiple people working and studying from home—the Gig plan might actually be the better investment. You won't have any buffering issues at all, and it future-proofs you if you add more devices down the road.

Customer: (pause) I mean, the extra twenty bucks is... it's a bit much. What about the 500? Will that be enough?

Agent: For five devices doing schoolwork, streaming, video calls? Yeah, 500 meg should handle that pretty well. It's actually double what you have now, so you'll definitely notice a huge difference. The Gig would be overkill for your needs, to be honest.

Customer: Okay, okay. Let's do the 500 then. How soon can you get that set up?

Agent: (typing) Great choice. So I can get you scheduled for an upgrade. Since you're already a Frontier customer in that area, this should just be a simple line upgrade on our end—no truck roll needed. We can have that activated as early as tomorrow, or if you prefer, I have slots available for Thursday and Friday as well.

Customer: Tomorrow? Like, how do I get it set up tomorrow?

Agent: So what'll happen is our system will push the upgrade remotely to your modem overnight, and it should be active by early morning. You might experience a brief disconnect—like thirty seconds to a minute—but after that you'll be all set with the new speeds. You shouldn't need to do anything on your end.

Customer: Oh, that's easy. Yeah, tomorrow works for me then.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, I've got you scheduled for tomorrow between midnight and 6 AM. You should be good to go by morning. Um... I do need to let you know that after your promotional year is up, the rate will go to $89.99. We'll send you a notice about thirty days before that happens, and you can always call back if you want to discuss options at that time.

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. One more thing—do I need to do anything with my modem or router?

Agent: Nope, everything's automatic on our end. Your current equipment is compatible, so there's nothing you need to change. Just keep your modem plugged in tonight, and by tomorrow morning you'll have the upgrade ready to go.

Customer: Awesome. That's really helpful, Marcus.

Agent: Happy to help! So just to recap, you're upgrading to our 500 megabit plan at $79.99 for the first year, activation is tomorrow morning, and you should see the upgrade take effect before 6 AM. You should receive a confirmation email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks so much.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being a loyal customer. Enjoy those faster speeds, and have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
