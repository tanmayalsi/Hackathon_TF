Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So I'm currently on the 500 Mbps plan, and honestly, I'm just not getting the speeds I need anymore. I've got a bunch of people working from home now, and we're streaming constantly, so... I'm looking to upgrade.

Agent: I completely understand. Working from home definitely puts more demand on the internet. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing here you've been with us for about three years, and you're right—you're on our 500 Mbps Fiber plan. That's great that you've been a loyal customer. Let me ask you a few questions to make sure we get you set up with the right service. How many devices are typically connected at one time?

Customer: Oh, probably like... eight, nine devices? We've got laptops, tablets, phones, a couple of smart TVs. My son's always gaming too, which I think eats up a lot.

Agent: Yeah, gaming can definitely use some bandwidth. And are you experiencing any lag or buffering issues right now?

Customer: Definitely. Especially when multiple people are on video calls. It gets really choppy. And downloads take forever.

Agent: Okay, I hear you. So we have a couple of options for you. We can upgrade you to our 1 Gig Fiber plan, which is 1000 Mbps. That would be a significant jump from where you are now. We also have a 750 Mbps plan that's kind of a middle ground. Which direction are you leaning?

Customer: What's the price difference? I mean, is 1 Gig overkill, or...?

Agent: (typing sounds) So, your current plan is $79.99 a month. The 750 Mbps plan would be $99.99, and the 1 Gig plan is $129.99. Now, I should mention we have a promotion running right now for new plan upgrades. I can get you the 1 Gig plan for $99.99 for the first year, then it goes to the regular price after that.

Customer: Oh, really? Okay, that's... that's actually pretty reasonable.

Agent: Right? And with 1 Gig, you'd have way more than enough headroom for everything you're doing. Video calls, gaming, streaming—no problem at all.

Customer: Yeah, let's do it. Let's go with the 1 Gig plan.

Agent: Awesome choice. Before I process that, let me just confirm a couple of things. Your service address is still... (typing) ...4521 Maple Drive, yeah?

Customer: That's correct.

Agent: Great. And we don't need to send a technician out for this since you're already on our Fiber network. We can make this change on our end and it should take effect... (pause) ...within about 24 hours. You might experience a brief service interruption during that time, maybe a few minutes, but nothing major.

Customer: Oh, so I don't have to be home or anything?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. We'll handle it remotely. Just make sure all your equipment stays powered on, okay?

Customer: Perfect. I really appreciate that.

Agent: Of course! So let me just run through what's happening here. We're upgrading you from 500 Mbps to 1 Gig Fiber. Your new rate is $99.99 for the first 12 months, then $129.99 after that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: Um, will I need a new router or anything?

Agent: That's a great question. Your current Frontier router should support Gigabit speeds, so you should be fine. But if you do experience any connection issues after the upgrade, just give us a call back and we can troubleshoot that with you. Most customers don't need anything new.

Customer: Alright, sounds good. Thank you so much.

Agent: You're very welcome! Your upgrade should be all set to go live tomorrow. You'll get a confirmation email within the next couple hours with all your new details. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and thank you for being such a great customer. You have a wonderful day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
