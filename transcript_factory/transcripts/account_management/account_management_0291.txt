Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek. Yeah, so I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My current plan is just, um, not cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm seeing that here. So you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I mean, it was fine for a while, but now I'm working from home more, and my wife, she does video calls for her job too, and we've got the kids streaming stuff... it's just not fast enough anymore.

Agent: Oh man, I totally get that. A lot of customers we talk to are in the same situation, especially with everyone home these days. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you familiar with our higher tier packages?

Customer: Um, not really. What do you guys have available in my area? I think fiber goes pretty fast, right?

Agent: It absolutely does. Fiber is fantastic. So right now you're on 100 megabits per second download. We have some great options available at your address. We can upgrade you to Fiber 300, which gives you 300 megs down, or if you really want to future-proof things, we've got Fiber 500.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference in price? Like, what would that run me monthly?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great question. So your current plan is $59.99 a month. If we upgrade you to the Fiber 300, that would be $79.99 a month. And then the Fiber 500 would be $99.99 monthly.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) And with the 300 plan, that's gonna be... that's definitely gonna be faster, right? Like, noticeably faster?

Agent: Oh yes, absolutely. You're tripling your speed. So instead of 100 megs, you're getting 300. That means faster downloads, faster uploads, and your video calls will be much smoother. And if multiple people are using the internet at the same time, you'll have plenty of bandwidth to handle it.

Customer: Yeah, okay, that sounds like what we need. The 300 should be good. What about the installation? Do I have to have someone come out? Because we're pretty busy this week.

Agent: Let me check that for you. (typing sounds) So good news—since you're already a fiber customer at that address, we can actually do this as a remote upgrade in most cases. You wouldn't need a technician to come out. We can push the upgrade through, and you should see the speed increase within 24 hours.

Customer: Oh, that's perfect! That's really convenient.

Agent: Right? Much easier that way. (pause) Now, I do want to mention, we have a promotion running right now. If you commit to a one-year contract, I can knock $10 off your monthly rate for the first six months. So instead of $79.99, you'd be paying $69.99 for the first half year.

Customer: Oh wow, really? (pause) Yeah, I mean, we're not going anywhere. A one-year contract is fine for us. That sounds like a good deal.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) Okay, so let me just confirm everything here. You want to upgrade to Fiber 300 at $69.99 a month for the first six months, then $79.99 after that, with a one-year contract. The upgrade should be active within 24 hours with no technician visit needed. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect. Um, one more thing though—is there anything I need to do on my end? Like, do I need to restart my modem or anything?

Agent: That's a good question. So when we push the upgrade through, you might want to unplug your modem for about 30 seconds and plug it back in, just to make sure it recognizes the new speeds. But honestly, a lot of times it's automatic. If you don't see the improvement after 24 hours, then I'd definitely give it a restart.

Customer: Okay, got it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm going to go ahead and process this upgrade for you now. Your new plan will be active as of tomorrow morning. You should receive a confirmation email shortly at the address we have on file. Is that still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, there's no early termination fee as long as you complete the one-year term. But if you ever have any issues or questions, you can always give us a call back. Our number is on your bill, or you can just call 1-800-FRONTIER.

Customer: Great, thanks so much. I really appreciate the help.

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again, Derek.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier, and enjoy those faster speeds! Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
