Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Derek. So I'm currently on like, the 100 megabit plan? And honestly, it's just... it's not cutting it anymore. I'm working from home now, and my kids are doing school online, so we've got like three or four devices going at once and it just keeps buffering on me.

Agent: Oh man, I totally understand. Yeah, working from home and having multiple devices definitely puts a strain on those speeds. (typing sounds) Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0142.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our 100 Mbps plan. How long have you been with us?

Customer: Um, I think like three years? Maybe a little more. We've been pretty happy with it until recently, but yeah, like I said, things have changed.

Agent: Great, and I appreciate your loyalty. So just to give you some options, we actually have some fantastic plans available in your area. You could upgrade to our 400 Mbps plan, or if you really want to future-proof yourself, we have our 1 gigabit fiber plan. That's gonna be substantially faster. Have you heard about our gig plan?

Customer: A gig? That seems... I mean, is that actually necessary? I don't want to pay a ton more if I don't need it.

Agent: No, that's a fair question. So the 400 Mbps would definitely handle what you're describing—work from home, multiple streaming devices, online schooling. That's more than enough for most families. The gig plan is really more for... you know, if you're downloading huge files regularly, or if you're doing like 4K video streaming on multiple devices simultaneously. It's definitely overkill for most people, but some customers like having that headroom.

Customer: Okay, so the 400 would probably be better for us then?

Agent: I'd say so, yeah. And honestly, we've got a really good promotion running right now. (typing sounds) For existing customers upgrading, I can get you on the 400 Mbps plan at... let me see here... $79.99 a month for the first year. After that it goes to our regular rate of $99.99. How does that sound?

Customer: That's not too bad. How much more than what I'm paying now?

Agent: What are you currently paying for your 100 Mbps plan?

Customer: I think like... $65? Maybe $70?

Agent: (pause) Okay, so yes, it would be about $10 to $15 more per month, but you're getting four times the speed, so you'd definitely notice the difference. Plus, no installation fee for the upgrade since you're already a customer with existing equipment.

Customer: Nice. Do I have to get like, new equipment or anything?

Agent: So you'll need to upgrade your modem. We have a few options—we can send you one of our newer modems, which would be included in the service, or you could purchase your own compatible modem. Most customers just go with the one we provide since it's... it's just easier.

Customer: Yeah, okay, let's just do that. When would I be able to get it set up?

Agent: (typing sounds) So I can actually start the upgrade process right now, and we can schedule a technician to come out. It usually takes about 3 to 5 business days. Are you available during the day? We can do a morning window or an afternoon window.

Customer: Umm, let me think. Next week would probably be better. I'm pretty slammed this week. Like, Tuesday or Wednesday of next week, afternoon?

Agent: (pause) Okay, so looking at next week... we have availability Tuesday afternoon, or Thursday morning would work. Which would you prefer?

Customer: Tuesday afternoon works.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. So I'm scheduling a technician visit for Tuesday, April 18th, between 1 and 4 PM. Does that window still work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's good.

Agent: Great. And just so you're aware, the technician will swap out your modem and make sure everything's configured properly. Your speeds should increase right away. And if you have any issues, you can always give us a call back. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Okay, cool. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. I'll send a confirmation email to the email address on file with all the details—the appointment time, what to expect, all that. Your new plan will be active starting next Tuesday, so you should see that reflected on your next bill. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome! Thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer, and enjoy that faster internet.

Customer: Will do. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
