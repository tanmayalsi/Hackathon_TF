# Frontier Communications - Service Upgrade Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Marcus. So I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you calling in. I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm seeing you're currently on our 300 megabit plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've had it for a while, and honestly, I'm working from home now and my family streams a lot. It's just not fast enough anymore, especially when multiple devices are going.

Agent: I totally understand. Working from home definitely changes things. (pause) So what kind of speeds were you looking for? We have a few options available in your area.

Customer: Um, I'm not really sure. What do you recommend? Like, what's the next step up?

Agent: Great question. So your next option would be our 500 megabit plan. That's a solid upgrade and really good for multiple devices streaming at once, video calls, that sort of thing. We also have our top tier, which is our 1 gigabit plan, if you want the absolute fastest speeds available.

Customer: What's the price difference? I don't want to go crazy with my bill.

Agent: (typing sounds) So your current plan is $69.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, somewhere around there.

Agent: The 500 meg plan would be $89.99 per month, so that's an extra twenty bucks. And the gig plan is $119.99. Now, I should mention we're currently running a promotion where new upgrades get the first three months at 15% off.

Customer: Oh, that's nice. (pause) So that would be $76.49 for the 500 meg plan for three months?

Agent: Exactly right. You did the math faster than I could pull it up. (laughs) After that, it goes to the regular $89.99. The upgrade would be processed within 24 to 48 hours, and you wouldn't need any new equipment since your modem supports those speeds already.

Customer: That actually sounds pretty good. I think the 500 meg would be enough. Is there anything else I should know about? Any contracts or...?

Agent: No contracts on our plans—you can change or cancel anytime. The 500 meg is month-to-month, which gives you flexibility. The only thing I'd recommend is making sure your WiFi router is up to date. Older routers sometimes don't maximize those higher speeds.

Customer: Mine's probably a couple years old at this point.

Agent: (pause) So we do offer router upgrades if you're interested. Our latest model is really solid, handles WiFi 6 technology. That's an additional $10 a month if you want to rent one, or you can purchase your own externally if you prefer.

Customer: I think I'll just grab one online. I don't want to add another monthly charge if I can help it. (laughs)

Agent: Smart move. Totally understand. (typing sounds) So let me just confirm everything here. I'm going to upgrade you from the 300 meg plan to the 500 meg plan, effective immediately. You'll receive the promotional discount for your first three months—that's 15% off, bringing your bill to $76.49. After that, it's $89.99 a month.

Customer: Perfect. When will it take effect?

Agent: The change will process tonight, so you should see the speeds by tomorrow afternoon, barring any issues. You'll get an email confirmation in about an hour with all the details.

Customer: Great. Will I get a new bill or...?

Agent: Your next bill will reflect the new rate starting next month. The promotional period applies to your first three months going forward.

Customer: Got it. Hey, I really appreciate the help, Marcus.

Agent: Of course! I'm glad we could get you set up. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and enjoy those faster speeds. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
