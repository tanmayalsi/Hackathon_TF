# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, my name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My speeds have just been kind of slow lately and I'm wondering what options you have.

Agent: Great, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And what's the best name to have on file?

Customer: It's James Morrison.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account here. I see you're currently on our 100 megabit fiber plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. We've had it for about two years now and it was great at first, but now with working from home and my kids doing online school, it just feels like everything's buffering, you know?

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. That's actually a really common situation we're hearing about. More devices on the network can definitely impact your speeds. So let me ask you this—what kind of activities are you doing online? Like are we talking video conferencing, streaming, gaming, all of the above?

Customer: All of it, pretty much. I'm on Zoom calls most of the day, my wife streams shows while she's working out, and my son is always on his gaming console. So yeah, it's a lot happening at once.

Agent: (pause) Right, so for that kind of usage, you'd probably benefit from moving up to our 400 megabit plan or even our gig plan, which is one gigabit. Those would give you way more bandwidth to handle all those activities simultaneously without the lag you're experiencing.

Customer: Okay, what's the price difference? I mean, we're already paying... I want to say it's like $79 a month?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here. Yes, you're at $79 for the 100 meg plan. Our 400 meg plan is $129 a month for the first year, then it goes to $149 after that. And our gigabit plan is $159 for the first twelve months, then $189 after the promotional period ends.

Customer: Hmm, okay. So that's a pretty significant jump. Is there... I don't know, is there any kind of bundling or discount you can offer?

Agent: That's a great question. Do you have phone or TV service with us, or is it just internet?

Customer: Just internet. We cut the cord years ago.

Agent: Gotcha. Well, we do have a bundle with our phone service, but I completely understand if that's not something you're interested in. However, what I can do is apply a loyalty discount to your account. Since you've been a customer for two years without any issues, I can take another $10 off the 400 meg plan during your promotional period, bringing it down to $119 a month for year one.

Customer: (pause) That's better. Um, so with the 400 meg, would that pretty much solve the problem I'm having?

Agent: In most cases, yes. I mean, honestly, the gig plan would be like... future-proofing yourself, but 400 megs should handle your streaming, video conferencing, and gaming without any issues. You'd have plenty of headroom there.

Customer: Alright, I think the 400 meg makes sense then. But let me ask you—I don't have to change my router or anything, right? Because I just got one a few months ago.

Agent: (typing sounds) Well, that's a good question. If your router is relatively new, it should be fine, but it does need to be WiFi 6 capable or at least WiFi 5 to really take advantage of those speeds. What model do you have?

Customer: Um, I'm not sure off the top of my head. It's just the one you guys provided though.

Agent: Ah, okay. If it was provided by us a few months ago, it should be compatible. But just to be safe, when our technician comes out for the upgrade installation, they can verify that for you. And if we need to swap it out, we can do that at that time. There's no additional charge for that.

Customer: Oh, there's a technician coming out? I thought this might be something I could just do myself?

Agent: Well, with a plan upgrade like this, it's usually better to have a technician come out. They'll make sure everything's configured correctly and that you're getting the speeds you're paying for. Plus, they can run some diagnostics to make sure there aren't any other issues. Typically it's about a 30-minute to one-hour appointment.

Customer: Okay, when could we do that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. We're booking appointments pretty quickly right now. What does your schedule look like? Are you available on weekdays, or would a weekend work better for you?

Customer: Weekdays are tough with work and everything. Could we do a Saturday?

Agent: Absolutely. I've got an opening this coming Saturday, the 16th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works. Morning is better anyway.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to get this all set up for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so to confirm—we're upgrading you from the 100 meg plan to the 400 meg plan with a $10 loyalty discount. Your new rate will be $119 a month for the first year, then $149 after that. Your service upgrade and technician visit are free. And we have a technician scheduled for this Saturday, the 16th, between 8 AM and 12 PM.

Customer: Great. Do I need to do anything before the technician comes?

Agent: Just have your modem and router accessible and maybe restart them the night before, just to have a clean slate. The technician will handle everything else. Oh, and just so you know, there will be a brief service interruption during the installation—probably just a few minutes. But they'll give you a heads up before they do it.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. And you'll need someone to be home, right?

Agent: Yes, someone needs to be there to let them in. A confirmation email will be sent to the address on file, and you'll get a courtesy call the day of the appointment just to make sure everything's still good.

Customer: Perfect. Alright, Derek, I think that's everything. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. We're really excited to get you on the 400 meg plan. You should see a huge difference with your speeds, especially with everything you've got going on at home. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it.

Agent: Awesome. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. Have a great rest of your day, and we'll see you on Saturday.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. You too.

Agent: Bye now.
