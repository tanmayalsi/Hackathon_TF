Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on the 100 megabit plan, and I've been thinking about upgrading. My internet's been pretty good, but I'm working from home now and I need something faster.

Agent: Oh, that's great! I'm glad you've had a good experience with us. Working from home definitely calls for faster speeds. (typing sounds) Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years on that 100 meg plan. That's awesome. So you're looking to bump things up—are you thinking like videoconferencing, uploading files, that kind of thing?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I do a lot of video calls and I've been uploading like, design files that are pretty large. Sometimes my downloads just... they're slower than I'd like, you know?

Agent: Totally understand. For that kind of work, I'd definitely recommend looking at our fiber plans. We've got a 300 megabit option, or if you really want to future-proof yourself, we offer a 500 meg plan that's been super popular with our remote workers.

Customer: What's the difference in price between those two?

Agent: (typing sounds) So let me see what I can offer you. Your current rate is $59.99 a month, right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: Okay, so the 300 meg plan would be $79.99, and the 500 meg would run you $99.99 per month. Now, since you've been such a loyal customer, I can actually apply a promotional discount. (pause) I can get you the 300 meg plan for $69.99 for the first year, then it goes to the regular $79.99 after that.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) What about the 500? Can you do anything on that one?

Agent: Let me check... (typing sounds) You know what, because you've been with us for three years without any service interruptions, I can actually do the 500 meg plan for $84.99 for your first year. That's a $15 discount off the regular price.

Customer: Oh wow, that's... that's actually really good. Yeah, I think I'll go with that. The 500 megabit plan.

Agent: Excellent choice! (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm putting that in the system for you. Now, I do want to let you know—since you're upgrading from our standard fiber to the 500 meg, you might need a newer modem to handle those speeds. Do you currently own your modem or are you renting it from us?

Customer: I think I'm renting? I'm not really sure, to be honest.

Agent: That's totally fine. (typing sounds) Yeah, I'm seeing here that you have a rental unit. The good news is we can send you an upgraded modem at no additional charge. It'll come in about five to seven business days. You'll just swap it out—it's really straightforward. Do you have any experience with that kind of thing?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I've set up equipment before. That shouldn't be a problem.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, your speeds should activate immediately on our end once we process this, but you won't actually see those speeds until you have the new modem plugged in. So don't be alarmed if things look the same for a few days.

Customer: Got it. When does all this take effect?

Agent: (typing sounds) So your billing cycle is on the 15th, and today's the... (pause) ...the 8th, so your upgrade will take effect on your next billing date, which would be December 15th. Your first bill with the new rate will reflect the promotional pricing I mentioned—$84.99.

Customer: Awesome. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: (pause) Just a couple things. When you get that modem, there'll be instructions in the box. If you run into any issues with the installation, you can always call us back and we can walk you through it. Also, I'm gonna send you a confirmation email with all the details of your upgrade—plan speed, new rate, everything. And I'll include the tracking information for your modem once it ships.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you so much, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! I really appreciate your loyalty to Frontier, and I think you're going to love those faster speeds. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Alright, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
