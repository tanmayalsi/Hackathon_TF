# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently a customer, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My speeds have been pretty slow lately, and I'm working from home more now, so I really need something faster.

Agent: Oh, absolutely, I can definitely help you with that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And what name is on the account?

Customer: It's under Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I'm looking at your account now. I can see you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right. I've had it for about... maybe two years now? And it was great at first, but like I said, it's been dragging lately. Plus, my girlfriend moved in with me about six months ago, and now we're both streaming and on Zoom calls at the same time, and... it just gets really slow.

Agent: I hear you. (pause) That's actually pretty common when you've got multiple people using the connection simultaneously. The good news is we have some excellent options that would be perfect for your situation. Let me tell you what we have available in your area.

Customer: Okay, great.

Agent: So right now, you're on Fiber 100, which gives you 100 megabits per second download speeds. We have Fiber 300, which is 300 Mbps—that's three times faster. And then we also have Fiber Gig, which is 1 gigabit per second, or 1,000 Mbps. That one's our top tier. Which of those sounds like it might work for you?

Customer: Wow, okay. (pause) What's the price difference? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: That's fair. So your current plan is $79.99 per month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, so Fiber 300 would be $99.99 per month, and Fiber Gig would be $129.99 per month. Now, I should mention we're actually running a promotion right now where if you upgrade to either of those plans, we can lock in that price for the first year. So you wouldn't see an increase after twelve months.

Customer: Oh, really? For the whole first year?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. And just to give you an idea of what those speeds would mean for you—with Fiber 300, you and your girlfriend could each do a video call, and you could still have bandwidth for streaming or downloading without any issues. Fiber Gig is really designed for households that have a lot of heavy usage or if you have kids gaming and everything happening at once.

Customer: (pause) The 300 sounds like it might be enough. But I'm just curious—if I go with that, how long do I have to commit to it? I don't want to be locked into a contract or anything.

Agent: Great question. Our fiber plans have no long-term contract requirement, so you can cancel anytime if you need to. That said, if you stay for the full twelve months at the promotional rate, you'll really maximize your savings.

Customer: Okay, that's good to know. Yeah, I think I'll go with the Fiber 300 then. Can we make that happen today?

Agent: Absolutely, Michael. I can get that upgraded for you right now. (typing sounds) I'm just going to verify a couple of things here. The service address is still 447 Maple Street, Apartment 2B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And your equipment—the gateway and everything—that's all compatible with the higher speeds, so you won't need anything new. The upgrade should take effect in about 24 hours, and you'll start seeing those faster speeds right away.

Customer: Oh great, so I don't need a technician to come out or anything?

Agent: Nope, no technician needed. We can do this all remotely. It's one of the perks of our fiber network. (pause) So I've got the upgrade here to Fiber 300 at $99.99 per month, locked in at that price for the first twelve months. After that, it would be our standard rate, which we can discuss closer to that time. Does everything look good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect. When exactly does it go into effect?

Agent: So I'm processing this now, and the system shows it'll be active by... (typing sounds) ...tomorrow by noon. You should get a confirmation email within the next hour or so with all the details.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

Agent: Of course, Michael. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Any questions about the service or anything like that?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. I'm really happy with this. Thanks again, Derek.

Agent: My pleasure. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we really appreciate your business. You have a great day, Michael.

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now.
