Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan, and honestly, I'm thinking about upgrading. My household is getting busier, you know? My wife's been working from home more, the kids are streaming stuff, and I've just been noticing some slowdowns during peak hours.

Agent: I completely understand. That's actually really common, especially with more devices on the network these days. (typing sounds) So you're on our 500 meg plan right now. That's great that you're looking to upgrade. Can I ask what you're looking to get? Are you interested in our gig fiber, or maybe looking at our 750 meg option?

Customer: Um, yeah, I was thinking gig? Like, the full gigabit? I want to make sure we've got enough for everything, and honestly, I don't want to have this conversation again in another year or two.

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, I hear that. Gigabit is definitely the way to go if you want future-proofing. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm getting you pulled up now. Okay, so I see you've been with us for about three years, and you're in the Sunnyvale area, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. And the good news is gigabit fiber is absolutely available at your address. So with that upgrade, you'd be going from 500 megs download to a full 1 gigabit—that's 1,000 megabits—and your upload speeds would jump significantly too. That's really going to help with the work-from-home situation and streaming.

Customer: Perfect. What's that going to run me?

Agent: Great question. So right now, we've got a promotion running. For the gigabit plan, I can get you set up at $89.99 a month for the first twelve months. After that, it moves to our standard rate of $109.99 a month.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Is that locked in? Like, will it stay at that price after the twelve months?

Agent: That's a good question. So the promotional rate is guaranteed for the first year. After twelve months, it would move to the standard rate of $109.99. However, we do have loyalty offers that come through periodically, so you might qualify for another promotion closer to that time. But I can't guarantee that right now.

Customer: (pause) And I don't need new equipment or anything? I've got the modem they gave me.

Agent: Let me check what modem you have. (typing sounds) I'm seeing here that you have the... the Arris SB8200. That's actually a really solid modem, and it's definitely gigabit capable, so you won't need to swap that out. Your gateway—the router—is a model that we'd recommend upgrading though. It's a few years old now, and to really take advantage of those gig speeds, you'd want something that can handle that bandwidth.

Customer: How much is that?

Agent: We can either sell you one outright for $149, or we can add it to your monthly bill as a rental for $15 a month. Most customers go with the purchase option since it pays for itself in about ten months.

Customer: Yeah, I'll just buy it. Get it all over with.

Agent: Smart choice. (typing sounds) Alright, so let me just walk through what we're doing here. We're upgrading you from your 500 meg plan to our gigabit fiber plan at $89.99 for the first year. We're adding a new Wi-Fi 6 gateway—that's going to be $149 one-time. And that equipment should arrive within five to seven business days.

Customer: When does the speed upgrade kick in?

Agent: Great question. So the new equipment will arrive in that five to seven day window, and once you get it, you can either self-install—which takes about ten minutes—or if you'd prefer, we can schedule a technician to come out at no charge and get everything set up for you. The speed upgrade on your account will actually be active immediately once the equipment ships, but you won't see those speeds until the new gateway is installed and activated.

Customer: I think I can handle it myself. I'm not too worried about that.

Agent: Perfect. That makes it really easy then. You'll get an email with tracking information and some quick setup instructions. (pause) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's good. When does this take effect?

Agent: Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and process this upgrade for you right now. The promotional pricing starts on your next billing cycle, which looks like... (typing sounds) March 15th. You'll see the rate change reflected on your next bill after that date.

Customer: Okay, that works.

Agent: Perfect. So just to confirm, we have your address here as 1847 Oak Street in Sunnyvale. Is that still correct?

Customer: Yep, that's right.

Agent: (typing sounds) Wonderful. Alright, your confirmation number is going to be [inaudible] ... let me get that for you. It's FDN-8847-293-KL. I'm going to email that to you along with the equipment tracking and setup instructions.

Customer: Great, I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! We really appreciate your business, and thanks for upgrading with us. You're going to love those speeds. If you have any questions once the equipment arrives or anything comes up before then, just give us a call back or check your account online. You all set?

Customer: Yep, sounds good. Thanks Derek.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
