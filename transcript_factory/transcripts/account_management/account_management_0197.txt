Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Marcus. So I'm currently a customer, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet service. My speeds have been pretty slow lately, and I'm working from home now, so I need something faster.

Agent: Oh, absolutely, I completely understand. Working from home definitely requires a solid connection. (typing sounds) Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this your service address in Portland, Oregon?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So I'm looking at your account right now, and I can see you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. That's 100 megabits per download. Is that showing you're getting the speeds you're paying for, or...?

Customer: Well, it's been okay, I guess, but now that I'm doing video calls all day and uploading files to the cloud constantly, it just doesn't feel fast enough, you know? Like, sometimes my video gets a little choppy and... I don't know, I just feel like I need more headroom.

Agent: I hear you. Yeah, video conferencing and cloud uploads can really eat up bandwidth. Good news is that fiber internet is fantastic for that kind of work. (pause) So we have a couple of options available at your address. Let me see... You're eligible for our Fiber 300 plan, which gives you 300 megabits per second download, or we also have the Fiber 500 if you want to go even bigger.

Customer: What's the price difference? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so your current plan is $79.99 a month. The Fiber 300 would be $99.99 monthly, so that's an additional $20 a month. And the Fiber 500 is $129.99 a month, so that's $50 more.

Customer: Hmm... (pause) And the speeds are consistent? Like, I won't have problems with... I mean, will it actually be that fast?

Agent: Oh yes, absolutely. Fiber is direct-line technology, so you get dedicated bandwidth. It's not like cable internet where speeds fluctuate based on neighborhood usage. You're looking at consistent speeds, especially during peak hours when everyone's online. Plus, with Fiber 500, you'd have upload speeds of 100 megabits per second, which is great for those cloud uploads you mentioned.

Customer: That does sound better. (pause) What about upload speeds on the 300?

Agent: The Fiber 300 plan has 30 megabits per second upload. So you're looking at a pretty significant difference there—30 versus 100.

Customer: Yeah, okay, that... that actually makes a difference for me since I'm uploading a lot of files daily. You know what, I think the 500 plan makes more sense.

Agent: Excellent choice. That's going to be much better for your workflow. (typing sounds) Now, I do have some good news. We're running a promotion right now where we can waive the activation fee—that's normally $99—and we can lock in your rate for the first 12 months. So your first year would be $129.99 monthly instead of the typical promotional rate.

Customer: Wait, is that actually a promotional rate, or...?

Agent: (pause) Great question. So this rate is guaranteed for 12 months, and then it will adjust to our standard rate after that. Standard rate is typically around $149.99 for that plan, but you'd also be eligible for loyalty discounts depending on what's running at that time.

Customer: Okay, that's fair. And when would this upgrade happen? Do I have to do anything? Will my internet go down?

Agent: Great questions. So typically, we can schedule the upgrade for within the next 2 to 3 business days. Since you're already on fiber, the upgrade is really just a modem swap and a settings change on our end. You'd be without service for maybe... 5 to 10 minutes, tops. We'd send a technician to your home to swap out the modem, or if you're comfortable with it, you can do it yourself with a new modem we'd send you.

Customer: How long does a technician visit take?

Agent: Usually about 30 to 45 minutes. They'll come in, swap the equipment, run a speed test to make sure everything's working properly, and walk through anything you need to know. There's no charge for that service call since it's an upgrade.

Customer: Alright, that sounds good. Yeah, I'll go with the professional installation. I'd rather not mess with it myself.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so just to recap what I'm setting up for you: you're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500. That's 500 megabits download, 100 megabits upload. Your monthly rate will be $129.99 for the first 12 months, and we're waiving the $99 activation fee. We'll schedule a technician to come out, and the whole process should take about 30 to 45 minutes. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect. When can you schedule that for?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. We have some slots tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 5 PM, or we have availability Thursday morning between 9 AM and noon. What works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be better. Can you do like... 3 o'clock?

Agent: Let me see... (pause) Yes, we can do tomorrow at 3 PM. That's scheduled for your address on... Southeast 42nd Avenue. Is that still correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, we have your phone number as 555-0147, and your email on file is [inaudible]... actually, let me verify. What's your email address so I can send you the confirmation and any details about your appointment?

Customer: It's d-m-c-h-a-p-m-a-n at gmail dot com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, thank you. So you should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with your appointment details and technician information. He'll also have your phone number, so if he runs into any issues, he can call you.

Customer: Awesome. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope, you're all set! Just make sure someone's home tomorrow at 3 PM for the appointment. And if you have any questions before then, feel free to give us a call back. You can also reach us through our online chat if that's easier for you.

Customer: Great, thanks Marcus. I appreciate your help.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you for choosing Frontier, and I'm sure you're going to love the speed upgrade. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thank you.

Agent: Perfect. You have a great day, and we'll see you tomorrow at 3 PM!

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now!
