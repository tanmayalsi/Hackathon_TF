Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've had Frontier for about two years now and I'm pretty happy with the service, but I'm thinking about upgrading. My internet plan is getting a little slow for what I'm doing these days.

Agent: Oh, I'm glad to hear you've been a satisfied customer! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing your account. You're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. I think it's the 100 megabits per second thing?

Agent: Exactly. So you're getting 100 Mbps download speeds with that plan. What kind of activities are you finding that need more speed? Just so I can recommend the best option for you.

Customer: Well, I started working from home about six months ago, and I'm doing a lot of video conferencing—like, sometimes I have multiple calls going at once. Plus my family streams stuff constantly. Netflix, Disney+, all that. And my kids are always downloading games or whatever. It's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. That's actually a pretty common situation we see. With multiple people streaming and video conferencing simultaneously, 100 Mbps can definitely get stretched thin. (pause) The good news is we have some great options available at your address. We can upgrade you to our Fiber 300 plan—that's 300 megabits per second—or if you want the best performance, our Fiber 500 plan gives you 500 Mbps.

Customer: Wow, okay. So what's the price difference? I'm currently paying... I want to say like $79 a month?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, you're at $79.99 per month right now. Our Fiber 300 plan is $109.99 per month, and the Fiber 500 is $129.99 per month. Now, I should mention that we do have a promotion running through the end of the month. If you upgrade today, we can lock you in at a promotional rate for the first 12 months.

Customer: Oh really? What would that bring it down to?

Agent: (pause) For the Fiber 300, we could get you in at $89.99 for your first year, and then it goes to the regular $109.99 after that. For the Fiber 500, it would be $99.99 for year one.

Customer: That's not too bad actually. Um, what's the difference between the 300 and the 500 again? I mean, do I really need that much speed?

Agent: Great question. For what you're describing—multiple video conferences, streaming, and gaming downloads—I'd actually recommend the Fiber 300 plan. It's going to handle everything you mentioned really well without any issues. The 500 is kind of overkill unless you're running a business or have like eight or nine people using the internet heavily at the same time.

Customer: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. No, there's only like four of us. So 300 should be good then?

Agent: Absolutely. That should be perfect for your household. And the nice thing about fiber is it's really stable, so you won't get those speed drops that you might see with other types of connections. Plus, you're already fiber-enabled at your address, so the upgrade is pretty simple.

Customer: Oh, that's good. So I wouldn't need like a technician to come out or anything?

Agent: (typing sounds) So here's the thing—we can actually complete most of this remotely. We'll need to swap out your modem for a newer model that supports the higher speeds, but we can ship that to you. If you want a technician to install it, we can absolutely arrange that, but honestly, it's pretty straightforward to do yourself. Most customers just swap the cables and it takes about five minutes.

Customer: Yeah, I can probably handle that. I'd rather not wait around for a technician anyway.

Agent: Perfect. I'll get a new modem sent out to you. It should arrive within three to five business days. When you receive it, there are instructions inside, but basically you just power down your current modem, disconnect it, plug in the new one, and you're good to go.

Customer: Sounds easy enough. And when does the upgrade take effect?

Agent: Great question. The upgrade takes effect today—right after I finish processing this. So you should start seeing the higher speeds immediately once that new modem arrives and you get it plugged in. In the meantime, you'll stay on your current Fiber 100 speeds, and then [inaudible] you'll transition over.

Customer: Awesome. So just to make sure I have this right... I'm going to Fiber 300, locked in at $89.99 for the first year?

Agent: That's correct. And then after the first year, it adjusts to our regular rate of $109.99 per month.

Customer: Got it. And a new modem is shipping out?

Agent: Yes, we'll ship that out today, and you should have it within three to five business days. (brief pause) Let me just confirm your mailing address. I'm showing... 1847 Maple Street, Apartment 2B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm processing this now... okay, I've got the new modem shipping address confirmed. You should get a tracking number via email within the next hour or so. And just so you know, if you have any issues with the installation or if you don't receive it within five business days, just give us a call back and we'll make sure to take care of it.

Customer: Great, I appreciate that. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope, that should be all set! Oh, one more thing—we actually have a cool app called the Frontier app where you can monitor your connection speed and troubleshoot any issues. It's free and I'd definitely recommend downloading it. That way you can see that you're getting those Fiber 300 speeds once the modem arrives.

Customer: Oh nice, yeah I'll check that out. Well, this was super easy, Marcus. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for staying with Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again!

Agent: Have a great day, and enjoy your faster internet!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
