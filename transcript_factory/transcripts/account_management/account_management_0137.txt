# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about... I think three years now? And I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our 100 Mbps fiber plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I work from home now, and my wife is always streaming stuff, and our kids are doing school online. It's just... it's gotten really slow, you know? Pages take forever to load sometimes, and when multiple people are online it basically stops.

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally understand. That happens a lot with work-from-home situations. So what kind of speeds are you looking to upgrade to? We have a few options available in your area.

Customer: Um, I'm not really sure what I need, to be honest. What do you recommend?

Agent: (pause) Well, it really depends on your usage. At 100 Mbps, you're probably hitting your ceiling with multiple devices streaming and video calls happening simultaneously. I'd recommend looking at our 300 Mbps plan. That should handle everything you're doing without any slowdowns. And honestly, for just a little bit more, we also have a 500 Mbps option if you want some extra headroom for the future.

Customer: What's the price difference? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so your current plan is $59.99 a month. The 300 Mbps plan is $79.99, so it's an additional twenty dollars. The 500 Mbps is $99.99.

Customer: Hmm. So that's like... twenty to forty dollars more. That's not too bad, I guess. What about contract stuff? Do I have to sign something?

Agent: Great question. We have a few options. We can set you up with a month-to-month plan with no commitment, or if you're willing to do a one-year agreement, we can knock fifteen dollars off the monthly rate for the first year.

Customer: Wait, really? So the 300 would be...?

Agent: (typing sounds) It would be $64.99 for the first twelve months with the one-year agreement. After that, it goes to the regular $79.99.

Customer: That's... yeah, that's pretty good actually. I'll do the one-year thing. Can I get the 300 Mbps plan?

Agent: Absolutely! I think that's a smart choice. (typing sounds) Let me just get some information from you to get this set up. Is the service address the same as the phone number on file?

Customer: Yeah, same address. It's 447 Maple Street, Unit B.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And just to confirm, we'll be upgrading your modem as well since you'll need one that supports those higher speeds. We'll ship that out to you at no charge, and it should arrive within three to five business days. Is that okay?

Customer: Oh, I have to wait for a new modem? I can't just... I don't know, activate it or something?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately, no. Your current modem maxes out at 100 Mbps, so to take full advantage of the 300 Mbps speeds, you'll need the upgraded equipment. But like I said, it's free, and the installation is pretty straightforward. We'll include instructions, but basically you just plug it in and it auto-configures.

Customer: Okay, fine. That's not too bad then. When would this all take effect?

Agent: (typing sounds) So the new modem will ship out today—well, once I finish processing this—and should arrive by... let's say next Friday at the latest. The speed upgrade will be active immediately once the new equipment is connected and activated. I'm scheduling that for seven days from now to give you time to receive and set everything up.

Customer: Seven days? Can't you do it sooner? Like, tomorrow?

Agent: (pause) I wish I could, but the modem needs to physically arrive first, and with shipping, three to five business days is pretty standard. Once it's there, though, you're good to go. You can actually call us back and we can expedite the activation if you want.

Customer: Alright, alright. I guess I can wait a week. What else do I need to know?

Agent: Let me just run through the summary real quick. You're upgrading from 100 Mbps to 300 Mbps. Your promotional rate is $64.99 for the first twelve months, then $79.99 after that. You'll receive a free modem, and your service upgrade takes effect seven days from today. Do you have any other questions?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Oh, wait—is there anything with my bill? Like, do I need to do anything?

Agent: Nope, it'll all adjust automatically on your next billing cycle. You'll see the new rate reflected on your next bill. (pause) Alright, so I'm going to email you a confirmation with all these details, plus your tracking information for the modem once it ships. Should hit your inbox within the next hour or so.

Customer: Sounds good. Thanks, Derek. I appreciate your help.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. If you have any issues or questions before that modem arrives, just give us a call back, okay?

Customer: Will do. Have a good one.

Agent: You too! Thanks for calling Frontier.
