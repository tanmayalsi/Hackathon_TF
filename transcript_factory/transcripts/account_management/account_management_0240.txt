# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I've been with Frontier for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. I can definitely look into some upgrade options for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's... hold on, let me find that. It's 555-0247.

Agent: (typing sounds) Thank you. Let me pull that up here. Okay, I've got you. I'm seeing you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 300 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was great when I first got it, but now I'm working from home more, my partner streams a lot of Netflix, and the kids are always on their devices. It just feels slow sometimes.

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually really common. We've seen a lot of customers in similar situations, especially after the pandemic. So what kind of speeds are you thinking about? Are you looking to go up a tier or two?

Customer: I'm not really sure what the options are, to be honest. What do you recommend?

Agent: (pause) Well, let me ask you a few questions real quick so I can suggest what might work best for you. You mentioned multiple people streaming and working from home, so that's data-intensive stuff. How often would you say you're experiencing slowness or buffering?

Customer: Probably a few times a week? Like, if my partner is working on a video call and the kids are watching something, then I try to download something or check email, everything just... slows down.

Agent: Yeah, that makes sense. At 300 Mbps, you're sharing that bandwidth. We have a few options. We offer Frontier Fiber 500, Fiber 1000, and we actually just rolled out Fiber 2 Gig in some areas. Can I check if that's available at your address?

Customer: Wait, 2 gigabits? That sounds... expensive.

Agent: (chuckles) I know it sounds like a lot, but let me just check what we have available for you. It might surprise you. What's your service address?

Customer: It's 447 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B, in Springfield.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me see here... (pause) Great news. You know, our 2 Gig service is actually available at your location, and right now we have a promotional offer running.

Customer: Really? How much is that going to run me?

Agent: So normally, Fiber 2 Gig is $119.99 a month, but we're currently offering it at $99.99 for the first year. After that it goes to the regular price. The Fiber 1000 is $79.99 regularly, and 500 is $59.99. So you've got some good options depending on your budget.

Customer: Hmm, okay. What's the difference between 1000 and 2 gig? Is it worth the extra twenty bucks a month?

Agent: That's a fair question. So gigabit is 1000 Mbps, and 2 gig is, well, 2000 Mbps. The real difference you'd notice depends on what you're doing. For your situation with multiple people online... (pause) honestly, I think the gigabit would probably cover you really well. The 2 gig is more if you're doing heavy data transfers, like 4K video uploading, serious gaming, that kind of thing. But for streaming, working from home, regular browsing? The gig plan would handle that smoothly.

Customer: Okay, so you think the 1000 would be better for me than the 2 gig?

Agent: I think for your needs, yeah, the Fiber 1000 would be a smart choice. It's a significant bump from your 300, you'd see a real difference, and it's a good value. But if you want the absolute best and don't mind the extra cost, the 2 gig is there too. It's really up to you.

Customer: No, I think 1000 sounds good. Let's go with that. Is there anything else I should know about?

Agent: Great choice! Okay, so I'm going to get you set up on the Fiber 1000 plan at $79.99 per month. Your speeds are going to improve dramatically. The installation is free, and we can get a technician out to upgrade your equipment. We typically have availability within the next week or two. Do you have any days that work better for you?

Customer: Um, next week is pretty packed. What about the week after? Like Wednesday or Thursday?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... Wednesday the 19th, I can get you between 8 AM and 6 PM. Is that window workable for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works. Morning would be better though if you have it.

Agent: Perfect. How about 9 AM to 12 PM?

Customer: That's perfect, actually.

Agent: Awesome. So I have you down for Wednesday, the 19th, between 9 AM and 12 PM. The technician will come out, swap out your modem and router to support the higher speeds, and everything should be up and running the same day. The whole thing usually takes about thirty to forty-five minutes.

Customer: Okay, great. And I don't have to do anything, right? Like, I just keep everything plugged in?

Agent: Exactly right. Just keep your current equipment plugged in until the technician arrives. They'll take care of everything. You should see a confirmation email with all the details, including a direct number to the tech if there are any issues that day.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: (pause) No, I think we're all set! Oh, actually, just one thing—your bill will be going up from... let me see... you're currently at $49.99 to $79.99, so that's a $30 increase. That'll start on your next billing cycle. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Considering the speed bump, it's worth it.

Agent: Excellent. Well, I've got all your information here. You're all set for the upgrade. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks so much for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You're going to love those faster speeds. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
