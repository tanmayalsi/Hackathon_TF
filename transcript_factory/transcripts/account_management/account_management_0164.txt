Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So I've had Frontier for like... three years now? And I'm just thinking it might be time to upgrade my internet. My current speed is starting to feel a little slow, especially when my kids are doing their schoolwork online.

Agent: I completely understand. More people are working and learning from home these days, so bandwidth needs definitely go up. Let me help you out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's Sarah Chen.

Agent: (pause) Great, Sarah. I'm pulling up your account now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I see you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 300 plan. That's our 300 megabits per second package. How many devices are typically connected at the same time in your household?

Customer: Oh, definitely more than I'd like to admit. There's me working from home, so my laptop and my phone... my husband usually has his laptop going too... and then the kids have tablets and their laptops for school. So we're talking maybe six, seven devices at any given time.

Agent: Yeah, that adds up pretty quick. With that many simultaneous connections, especially if people are streaming or video conferencing, 300 Meg might be getting stretched thin. What kinds of activities are you noticing are slowest? Video calls, streaming, downloads?

Customer: (sighs) Everything, kind of. But mostly when my husband and I are both in video meetings, and one of the kids is trying to watch YouTube, it just tanks. Like, pages take forever to load for me.

Agent: That's a pretty typical scenario, and I think I know exactly what would help. We've got a couple of upgrade options for you. Our most popular upgrade would be to our Frontier Fiber 500 plan. That's 500 megabits per second, and it's really designed for households like yours with multiple users and heavy usage.

Customer: Okay, 500... (pause) What would that run me monthly?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check what promotions I can put together for you. Since you've been a loyal customer for three years, we definitely have some options. Our standard rate for Fiber 500 is $79.99 a month, but I'm seeing I can offer you an introductory rate of $59.99 for the first twelve months, then it goes to the standard rate.

Customer: Oh, that's not too bad. What's my current rate?

Agent: (pause, typing) You're at $49.99 right now on the 300 plan.

Customer: So it's about an extra ten dollars to start. (pause) Is there anything faster than the 500?

Agent: We do have our Frontier Fiber Gig plan, which is one gigabit per second. That's significantly faster, but we don't actually have that tier available at your address yet. That's still rolling out in your area. But honestly, for your needs, the 500 would be a really solid fit. You'd have plenty of headroom for everyone to do their thing simultaneously without bottlenecks.

Customer: Yeah, I think 500 would probably be good. Um... when could you install it? Or do I need to do anything on my end?

Agent: Good news—since you already have our Fiber infrastructure in place, it's just a simple configuration change. There's no technician visit required, and the upgrade typically takes effect within 24 hours. So you could literally have that speed bump tomorrow.

Customer: Wow, really? That's great. (pause) Is there anything else I should know, or any... like, equipment changes?

Agent: Great question. Your current modem and router should handle the 500 speed without any issues, so no new equipment needed. But if you wanted to optimize your wireless performance—sometimes older routers can be a bottleneck on WiFi—we do offer our Frontier WiFi Pro router for an additional $10 a month. It's dual-band, really strong coverage...

Customer: (interrupting) Actually, we just got a new mesh system a few months ago, so I think we're good there.

Agent: Perfect, perfect. That'll definitely help with your coverage. Okay, so let me just confirm the details here. (typing sounds) I'm going to upgrade you from Fiber 300 to Fiber 500, introductory rate of $59.99 monthly. [inaudible] That's for twelve months, after which it adjusts to $79.99. The upgrade processes within 24 hours of me submitting this.

Customer: That sounds right. And I don't need to do anything?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. The system handles it automatically. You might want to restart your modem sometime in the next 24 hours just to make sure it registers the new speeds properly, but otherwise, you're good to go.

Customer: Great. And just out of curiosity, will I see a noticeable difference? Like, what should I expect?

Agent: Oh, absolutely. You'll definitely notice it, especially with those video calls. The higher bandwidth means less buffering, faster downloads, faster uploads, and most importantly, your household will handle multiple heavy-use activities simultaneously without that lag you've been experiencing. I'd say your family's going to be pretty happy with it.

Customer: (laughs) That's what I like to hear. Okay, I think that's it then. When should I see this take effect?

Agent: You should start seeing the upgrade within the next 24 hours. You'll get a confirmation email shortly, and if you don't see the speed increase by tomorrow evening, just give us a call back and we can troubleshoot. But honestly, these usually go through without a hitch.

Customer: Awesome. Thank you so much, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. Thanks for being such a great customer with us for three years, and I really appreciate the opportunity to upgrade your service today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's everything. Have a good one.

Agent: You too, Sarah. Have a great day, and enjoy that faster internet! (pause) Thanks for calling Frontier Communications.
