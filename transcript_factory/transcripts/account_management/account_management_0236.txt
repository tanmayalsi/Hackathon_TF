Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan, and honestly, it's been pretty solid, but I'm working from home now and I'm thinking I need to bump up to something faster. What do you have available?

Agent: Oh, awesome. I'd be happy to help you upgrade today. Working from home, yeah, I totally get it—you definitely want that reliability. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Okay, so you're on our 500 meg plan currently. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. And just so I can confirm—this is for the same service address, correct? Still at 2841 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yep, that's right.

Agent: Great. So, we actually have some really great options for you. We can upgrade you to our gig plan—that's one gigabit download speeds—or if you really want to future-proof things, we just rolled out our two-gig plan in your area about three months ago. That one's absolutely screaming fast.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so what's the pricing looking like on those? Because right now I'm paying, like... I think it's around ninety-nine a month?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, you're on our promo rate right now at ninety-eight ninety-five. So the gig plan would be one-forty-nine ninety-five a month for the first year, then it goes to one-seventy-nine ninety-five. And the two-gig is two-twenty-nine ninety-five for year one, then two-fifty-nine ninety-five.

Customer: Whoa, okay, so... (pause) that's quite a jump. Um, do you have anything in between? Like, is there a... I don't know, like a 750 or something?

Agent: You know, that's a great question. Unfortunately, our service tiers jump from the 500 to the gigabit. But I'll tell you what—a lot of customers in your situation find that the gig plan is perfect for working from home. You get that extra headroom for, you know, video calls, uploading files, streaming... it's really night and day compared to 500.

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I do a lot of video conferencing. Probably like four, five hours a day. And I've been noticing some lag sometimes, especially if someone else in the house is streaming or whatever.

Agent: Okay, yeah, so that's classic congestion at 500. With the gig plan, you'd have way more bandwidth to share. You could have multiple people doing different things simultaneously without any issues whatsoever. And honestly, we have a promotion running right now. (typing sounds) Since you've been a loyal customer for... let me see here... five years with us, I can knock an additional twenty bucks off that first year rate on the gig plan.

Customer: (pause) Oh, really? So that would bring it to...?

Agent: One-twenty-nine ninety-five for the first year. So you're looking at about thirty-one dollars more than what you're paying now.

Customer: Okay, that's... that's actually not too bad. And then after the first year?

Agent: After year one, it goes to the standard rate of one-seventy-nine ninety-five. But hey, you can always give us a call back closer to that time, and we can talk about what promotions might be available then.

Customer: Uh-huh. Okay. And when could you guys install this? Or... do I need a technician to come out?

Agent: Great question. So, since you already have our service at your location, in most cases we can do a speed upgrade remotely. That means no technician visit necessary. We can actually activate it within the next forty-eight hours—probably by tomorrow afternoon. But let me just verify that your current modem is compatible. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so you've got the FG2420A modem. Yeah, that's gonna work perfectly for gig speeds. You're all set.

Customer: Oh, awesome. So I don't have to do anything on my end?

Agent: Nope, we handle everything. You'll get an email confirmation tonight with all the details, and then tomorrow morning, the speeds will just... activate. You might notice it immediately, or you can restart your modem if you want to feel that lightning-fast speed right away. (chuckles)

Customer: (chuckles) I like the sound of that. Yeah, let's do it. Let me just make sure—there's no contract or anything, right?

Agent: Nope, no contract. You're month-to-month, just like you are now. You can cancel anytime, though I don't think you'll want to once you experience that gig speed. (pause) So just to confirm all the details here: I'm upgrading your service from 500 megabit to one gigabit. Your rate for the first year will be one-twenty-nine ninety-five. After that, it goes to one-seventy-nine ninety-five. The upgrade will be active by tomorrow. Does all that sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Go ahead and do it.

Agent: Awesome. (typing sounds) Perfect, I've submitted the order here. Your confirmation number is 7-4-9-2-8-1-6-5. Did you get that?

Customer: 7-4-9-2-8-1-6-5. Got it.

Agent: Excellent. So you'll receive an email within the next couple of hours with all the details, your new rate, everything. If you have any issues after the upgrade activates, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you.

Customer: Great, I appreciate it, Derek. This was super easy.

Agent: Hey, I'm glad I could help! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks so much.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and thanks for calling. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
