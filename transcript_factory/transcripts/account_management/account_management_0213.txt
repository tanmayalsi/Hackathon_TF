Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I currently have the 100 megabit plan, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've had a lot of customers making that switch lately. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, just one second here... Perfect, I've got you. So I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years on the Fiber 100 plan. What's prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, streaming, or...?

Customer: A bit of both, actually. My wife and I both work from home now, and we're constantly having video calls. Plus, we've got two teenagers who are always on their devices, and the connection just keeps dropping during peak hours. It's getting ridiculous.

Agent: Yeah, that's a pretty common scenario, especially with multiple devices and video conferencing. With that kind of usage, I'd definitely recommend looking at our Fiber 300 or even our Fiber 500 plan. The 300 would give you significantly more bandwidth for those simultaneous connections. Have you heard anything about those tiers?

Customer: Um, not really. What's the difference price-wise? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so your current plan is $79.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Right. So the Fiber 300 would be $109.99 a month, and that's for 300 megabits per second download speeds. That's more than triple what you're getting now. Then we also have the Fiber 500 at $139.99, which is our premium offering. Most families in your situation go with the 300 and see a huge difference right away.

Customer: Okay, so an extra thirty bucks a month for the 300. That's... that's actually not too bad. What about, like, installation fees or anything like that?

Agent: Great question. Since you're already a Frontier customer with existing infrastructure at your location, we won't need a full installation. It's really just a modem upgrade, which we can ship out to you at no charge. There is a one-time service upgrade fee of $99, but I can actually waive that for you today as a loyalty credit.

Customer: (pause) Wait, you can waive that? That's... that's really helpful, actually. I wasn't expecting that.

Agent: Absolutely. You've been a good customer for three years, so it's the least I can do. Let me just make sure I'm setting this up right. So we're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, effective immediately, the monthly rate becomes $109.99, I'm waiving the $99 upgrade fee, and we'll ship a new modem out tomorrow. You should have it by... (typing sounds) ...Wednesday or Thursday at the latest.

Customer: That sounds perfect. Um, and I should be able to just swap it out myself, right? Like, I don't need to wait for a technician?

Agent: Exactly. It's super simple. You'll just unplug your current modem, plug in the new one, and you should be back online within a few minutes. We'll include instructions in the box, but it's really straightforward. You might experience a brief outage during the swap, maybe five to ten minutes.

Customer: Cool, cool. And my email and everything stays the same?

Agent: Yes, your email, your account, everything stays exactly the same. You're just increasing your speeds. Oh, and I should mention—we actually have a promotion running right now where if you stay on the 300 plan for a full year, we'll give you a $50 account credit back. So that essentially brings your first year cost down a bit.

Customer: (laughs) Okay, now that's nice. Yeah, I think I'm ready to do this. Let's go ahead.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just get a few confirmations from you. Is 555-0147 still the best number to reach you at?

Customer: Yep, that's the one.

Agent: And your address is still 4782 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: (typing sounds) Excellent. And just to confirm, you're good with the $109.99 monthly charge going forward?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Wonderful. (pause) Alright, I'm processing this now... Okay, you're all set. Your upgrade is confirmed, order number is F-9847-2156. You'll receive a confirmation email within the hour, and then the modem ships out tomorrow. You should see speeds kick in immediately once you install it.

Customer: Awesome. That was way easier than I thought it was going to be, honestly.

Agent: (laughs) I'm glad to hear that. That's what we like to hear. Oh, and one more thing—if you have any issues with the installation or if the speeds aren't what you expected once it's hooked up, just give us a call back. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Great, I really appreciate it. Thanks for the help, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we hope the new speeds work out great for you and your family. Have a fantastic day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
