Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've had a lot of customers mention that recently. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Before we get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's area code 503, then 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. Just one second... Alright, I'm seeing your account here. So you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've been with that for like... I don't know, three years maybe? And it was fine at first, but now with my wife working from home and my kids doing all their online school stuff, we're constantly buffering and getting kicked off video calls. It's pretty frustrating.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, that makes total sense. Multiple people streaming and video conferencing can definitely max out that 100 Mbps pretty quick. Good news is we have some great options available at your location. Let me pull up what we can offer you.

(pause with typing sounds)

Agent: So we have our Fiber 200 plan, which doubles your speed to 200 Mbps, and that's actually running a promotion right now. We can get you that for $49.99 a month for the first year, then it goes to our regular price of $69.99. How does that sound?

Customer: Okay, so that would be double what I'm paying now?

Agent: What are you currently paying monthly, if you don't mind me asking?

Customer: I think it's like $59.99, but I feel like I've gotten some promotional rates before that expired and then it went up.

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, I'm seeing $59.99 here, so that tracks. So the 200 plan would actually just be $10 more during the promotional period. But I also want to mention we have our top-tier Fiber 500 plan available. That's 500 Mbps, which is really ideal for households like yours with multiple users and devices. That one's running at $79.99 for the first year.

Customer: Wow, 500? That seems like overkill. Would we even... I mean, how much of a difference would that really make?

Agent: That's a fair question. Honestly, with what you've described—two work-from-home situations, kids streaming video—the 200 plan should handle that pretty comfortably. You're looking at, you know, five to ten times more headroom than what you have now. The 500 is more for people who are doing like, heavy video production work or have six, seven people in the household all doing demanding tasks simultaneously. For your situation, I'd probably recommend the 200.

Customer: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. Let me ask you this—what's involved with the upgrade? Do I need new equipment or anything?

Agent: (pause) Great question. So we would need to come out and do an installation, which is... let me see here... (typing sounds) we can actually waive that for you as part of the promotion. The modem and router would be shipped directly to your home, and our tech can come out and get everything connected. That usually takes about an hour, hour and a half tops.

Customer: Do I need to be home for that?

Agent: Yeah, unfortunately someone does need to be there to let the technician in and make sure everything's working properly before they leave. Looking at availability... (typing sounds) We've got some openings this Friday the 18th between 12 and 4 PM, or we could do next Monday, the 21st, morning or afternoon.

Customer: Friday would be better. Let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. So I have you down for Friday the 18th, sometime between noon and 4 PM. The technician will text you about an hour before they arrive so you know what time to expect them. Now, before I finalize everything, let me just confirm the terms one more time. We're upgrading you from the Fiber 100 to the Fiber 200 plan, that's 200 Mbps. You'll be locked in at $49.99 for 12 months, then it'll go to the regular rate of $69.99 a month after that. Installation is waived. Does all of that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. One thing though—will there be any downtime? Like, will I lose internet during the upgrade?

Agent: That's a good thing to ask. You may experience a brief interruption, maybe 10, 15 minutes, while we're switching everything over. But you should be back up and running pretty quickly after that.

Customer: Okay, cool. And just to make sure I understand the billing—it's not like I'm signing a contract or anything, right? I can cancel anytime if I want?

Agent: (pause) So there is a 12-month service agreement with this promotional rate. If you cancel before 12 months is up, there would be an early termination fee of $15 a month for however many months are remaining. But after that year is up, you're month-to-month with no contract.

Customer: Hmm. Okay, I mean, I'm sure it'll be fine. I'm not planning to go anywhere. But good to know.

Agent: Totally fair to ask. Alright, so I'm going to get this all submitted into our system. Let me just grab an email address from you to send a confirmation to, and a callback number in case we need to reach you before Friday.

Customer: The email is [inaudible] at Gmail dot com, and the callback number is the same number I called from, the 503 number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got it. Okay, you should receive a confirmation email within the next 5 to 10 minutes. It'll have all the details of your installation appointment, the new plan information, everything. If you don't see it, check your spam folder just in case. And again, the tech will text you Thursday night or Friday morning with their window of time.

Customer: Great, thanks. Is there anything else I need to do on my end?

Agent: Nope, you're all set! We'll take care of the rest. Just make sure someone's home Friday afternoon, and you should be good to go. I think you're really going to notice the difference once you get the upgraded speed. Anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks for making this easy, Marcus.

Agent: You bet! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
