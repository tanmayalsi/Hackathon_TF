Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on the 500 megabit plan, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore. I've got three kids doing remote school stuff, my wife's working from home, and we're all just... it's lagging constantly. We need something faster.

Agent: I completely understand. That can definitely be frustrating when you've got multiple people on the network. (typing sounds) Let me pull up your account here really quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, got you here. So you're on our Fiber 500 service right now. That's great that you already have fiber to your location. So what you're looking at is we have a couple of options available. We offer Fiber 1 gig, which is our gigabit service, and we actually just rolled out Fiber 2 gig in your area about three months ago.

Customer: Wait, 2 gig? That's... that's actually available for me?

Agent: Yes sir, it is. So our Fiber 2 gig is one terabyte per month of data, and it's basically double the speed of our Fiber 1 gig plan. For your situation with multiple devices and people working from home, that would definitely be the sweet spot.

Customer: Okay, nice. What's that gonna run me? I'm currently paying, like, 89 a month, I think?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here. So your current rate is $89.99 for the Fiber 500. With our Fiber 2 gig, we can get you set up at $129.99 per month for the first twelve months, and then it goes to $149.99 after that.

Customer: Hmm, so that's like forty bucks more a month initially?

Agent: Right, so you're looking at about $40 more for the first year, but you're getting four times the speed. And honestly, with what you've described—the three kids, the remote work—that extra bandwidth is going to make a huge difference in your experience. You won't be dealing with those lag issues anymore.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean... that does sound pretty good actually. What about installation and all that?

Agent: Great question. So since you already have fiber to your home, the installation is actually pretty straightforward. We'd just need to upgrade your modem and router to our newer equipment that supports the 2 gig speeds. That's something our tech can handle in about an hour, and there's no installation fee for upgrades on fiber customers. We just charge you the difference in equipment, which would be $15 for the modem upgrade.

Customer: Okay, okay. And when could somebody come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. What does your schedule look like? Are you pretty flexible, or do you prefer a specific day?

Customer: Um, I'm not super flexible during the week right now because of work, but I've got more wiggle room on weekends. What about this Saturday?

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) This Saturday we have... we have a morning appointment between 8 and 10 a.m. available, or an afternoon slot from 1 to 3 p.m.

Customer: The afternoon works better for us. Let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to schedule you for this Saturday between 1 and 3 p.m. (typing sounds) And the technician will come out with the new equipment. Before we finalize this, let me just confirm a couple things. Is there anything else you'd like to add to your service while we're making this change? We do offer phone service if you don't have that...

Customer: No, we've got phone through a different provider. We're good there.

Agent: Okay, no problem. And do you have any questions about the service before I lock this in?

Customer: (pause) I don't think so. Will my internet go down during the installation?

Agent: So briefly, yes. It'll probably be down for maybe 10 to 15 minutes total while we swap out the equipment and get everything configured. But once we're done, you should see the speeds right away.

Customer: Alright, sounds good.

Agent: Excellent. So just to recap: we're upgrading you from Fiber 500 to Fiber 2 gig, effective immediately. That's $129.99 per month for the first year. Your installation is scheduled for this Saturday, May 18th, between 1 and 3 p.m. The tech will bring new modem and router equipment, and there's a $15 upgrade fee for that. You'll receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes, and you can also call us if you need to reschedule. Does all of that sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect, Marcus. Thank you.

Agent: You're very welcome. I think you're gonna be really happy with the upgrade. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you on Saturday. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
