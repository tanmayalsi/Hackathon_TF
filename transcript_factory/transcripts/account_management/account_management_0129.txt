Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm pretty happy with your service, but I'm thinking about upgrading. My internet seems like it's getting slower, and I've got more devices now with the kids doing remote schoolwork and everything.

Agent: Great! I'm glad to hear you've been happy with us. And I totally understand—more devices definitely means you need more bandwidth. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 200 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I think it was like 200 Mbps or something?

Agent: Exactly, 200 megabits per second. And that's actually pretty solid for most households, but you're right—with remote schooling and multiple users streaming, you might benefit from upgrading. What kind of speeds are you experiencing when you run a speed test?

Customer: Um... (pause) I'm not really sure. I haven't actually tested it. But like, Netflix takes a while to load sometimes, and when the kids are on Zoom calls, other stuff just seems sluggish, you know?

Agent: Yeah, that's pretty common when you're juggling multiple high-bandwidth activities. The good news is we've got some excellent options for you. Our Fiber 500 plan would give you 500 Mbps—so two and a half times your current speed—and that's really great for families with multiple users. We also have our Fiber Gig plan, which is a full gigabit per second, but that might be more than you need.

Customer: How much more would that be? The 500 one?

Agent: Great question. Let me see what promotions we have available for you. (typing sounds) So your current rate is $79.99 a month, and the Fiber 500 would be $109.99 a month for the first twelve months. After that, it goes to $129.99.

Customer: Okay, so about thirty bucks more to start. What's included in that? Is it the same service otherwise?

Agent: It's essentially the same service—same equipment, same fiber connection—you're just getting that increased speed. And actually, you'd get our newest router with the upgrade, which has better range and handles multiple devices more efficiently. Plus, your modem gets a free upgrade as well.

Customer: (pause) That doesn't sound too bad actually. Um, what about installation? Would someone have to come out?

Agent: Good question. Since you already have our fiber infrastructure in place, we can do a remote upgrade in most cases. We'd just send you the new equipment, and you'd swap it out yourself. It's pretty straightforward—takes maybe ten minutes. But if you'd prefer, we can schedule a technician to come install it at no charge.

Customer: No, I can do it myself. I'm not completely helpless with technology. (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) I appreciate that! It definitely makes things easier. So I can get you scheduled for... let me see... we can have the new equipment to you by Thursday of next week. Would you want to keep the same billing date?

Customer: Yeah, that works. Thursday is fine. And just to clarify—this upgrade, it kicks in right away once I get the equipment?

Agent: Exactly. Once you swap out the modem and router and restart everything, the speed upgrade is active immediately. Your first bill will reflect the new rate starting from the upgrade date.

Customer: Perfect. And you said the first year it's $109.99?

Agent: That's right. $109.99 a month for twelve months, then $129.99 after that. Although, I'd recommend checking with us before your renewal period—we often have promotions available, so there may be other options at that time.

Customer: Okay, that's fair. Alright, let's do it.

Agent: Awesome! I'm really excited to get you on the Fiber 500. So let me just confirm some details here. (typing sounds) We have your service address as 2847 Maple Street, apartment 3B. Is that still correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And your contact phone number is 555-0147?

Customer: Yes.

Agent: Great. So you're all set. Your upgrade is scheduled for delivery Thursday, June 15th. You'll get an email confirmation today with the tracking information and installation instructions. You can reach us at 1-800-921-8101 if you have any questions before the equipment arrives. And just so you know, your new plan goes into effect on the day you swap out the equipment, so you'll want to do that as soon as it arrives to start enjoying those speeds.

Customer: Awesome, Derek. I really appreciate it. This should help a lot with everything going on at home.

Agent: My pleasure! I really appreciate your business, and thanks for choosing Frontier. If there's anything else I can help you with today, just let me know.

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day, and welcome to Fiber 500!

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
