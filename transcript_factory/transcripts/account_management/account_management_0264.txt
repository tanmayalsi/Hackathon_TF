# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've had the same plan for like... three years now, and it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've actually upgraded our network quite a bit since then. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm seeing an account here for... Michael Torres?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. So you're looking to upgrade your service. Currently, I'm showing you're on our 100 Mbps plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it's been fine for the most part, but my wife started working from home full-time, and I've got two teenagers who are constantly streaming stuff, so we're just... we're maxing it out all the time. It's getting slow.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, that makes total sense. Four people on the network definitely adds up. What kind of speeds are you thinking about?

Customer: I don't really know what I need, to be honest. What do you recommend?

Agent: Well, it really depends on your usage. With the work-from-home situation and streaming, I'd probably suggest looking at our 400 Mbps or 500 Mbps plans. The 400 is great for households like yours with multiple users, and the 500 is our premium tier if you want some extra headroom.

Customer: What's the price difference?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so your current plan is $59.99 a month. If you upgrade to the 400 Mbps, that would be $79.99 monthly. The 500 Mbps is $99.99.

Customer: Wow, that's... that's a pretty big jump from the 400 to the 500.

Agent: It is, but you do get the additional 100 Mbps, and honestly, a lot of customers find that extra bandwidth really helpful when multiple people are streaming in 4K or doing video conferences simultaneously.

Customer: (pause) How long would this take to set up? Do I need to get new equipment?

Agent: Great question. So we do have updated modems that we'd send out to you. You wouldn't need to do anything really; we'd just swap out your current modem. It's a pretty quick process. We could schedule a technician to come out, or if you're comfortable with it, you could self-install the modem. Usually takes about ten minutes.

Customer: I think I'd rather have someone come out, just to make sure it's done right.

Agent: Absolutely, that's no problem. We can definitely schedule a tech visit. They typically take about 30 minutes to an hour. (pause) Are you leaning toward the 400 or the 500?

Customer: Um... let me think. My wife's doing video calls for work, so she probably needs to be stable. How about the 400? That seems like it'll be enough.

Agent: I think that's a solid choice. You'll notice a huge difference from the 100. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm just pulling up some availability here. When would be a good time for you? We have some openings this week...

Customer: This week? That's fast. Uh, what about Friday? I'm usually home on Fridays.

Agent: Friday works great. Let me see what we have. (pause) We have a morning window between 8 AM and 12 PM, or an afternoon window from 1 PM to 5 PM.

Customer: Morning is better for me. Let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule that for Friday, 8 AM to noon. (typing sounds) And just to confirm, the address is still 847 Maple Drive, right?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Excellent. Now, is there anything else I should know? Any pets we should be aware of, or... [inaudible]?

Customer: No, no pets. Should be pretty straightforward.

Agent: Great. So just to recap what we're doing here: we're upgrading you from 100 Mbps to 400 Mbps. Your new rate will be $79.99 per month. We'll be sending out a new modem, and a technician will install it this Friday morning. Your service should not have any downtime during the installation.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. When will my bill change?

Agent: The new rate will start on your next billing cycle. (pause) Michael, I'm also showing that you're eligible for a promotional offer right now. For the first three months, I can knock $10 off the monthly rate, so it'd be $69.99 instead of $79.99.

Customer: Oh, really? That's great!

Agent: Yeah, it's one of our current promotions. After the three months, it'll go back to the regular $79.99, but that gives you a nice savings upfront.

Customer: Nice. Yeah, I'll definitely take that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm applying that now. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details, including your technician appointment and the new modem information.

Customer: Do I need to do anything before Friday, or...?

Agent: Nope, just keep your modem powered on as normal. The technician will handle everything else. Oh, and just make sure someone's home to answer the door. (laughs)

Customer: (laughs) Yeah, I'll be here.

Agent: Excellent. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks a lot, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael! Thanks so much for choosing Frontier. You're going to love the speed upgrade. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
