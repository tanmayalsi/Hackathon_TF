# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, where we connect you to what matters most. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, I've had Frontier for about three years now and I'm pretty happy with the service, but my internet has been feeling kinda slow lately. I'm working from home more now, and I think I need something faster.

Agent: I appreciate that, and I'm glad to hear you've been a satisfied customer. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options today. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Got it. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 300 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Like I said, it's been fine, but I'm doing a lot more video conferencing now and uploading files to the cloud, and honestly, it just doesn't feel like it's cutting it anymore. How much faster can I go?

Agent: Great question. So with Fiber, we have some really excellent options. Your current plan is 300 Mbps download speeds. We offer Fiber 500, Fiber 1 Gig—that's 1,000 Mbps—and our top tier is Fiber 2 Gig for 2,000 Mbps. Most work-from-home customers find that Fiber 1 Gig is a real game-changer, especially if you're doing video calls and uploads frequently.

Customer: Wow, okay, so that's like... triple the speed?

Agent: More than that actually—it's over three times faster than what you have now. And it's plenty of headroom for multiple devices running simultaneously. Do you have other people in the home using the internet at the same time?

Customer: Yeah, my wife works from home too, and we've got two kids that are doing online school. So yeah, there's definitely a lot going on.

Agent: Perfect, so that Fiber 1 Gig would be ideal for that situation. You'd have plenty of bandwidth to go around, and honestly, you probably won't notice much of a difference in price.

Customer: Really? I mean, my bill is already... (pause) ...I don't want it to jump up a ton.

Agent: I hear you. Let me show you the pricing. So you're currently paying $59.99 per month for Fiber 300. If we upgrade you to Fiber 1 Gig, it's $79.99 per month.

Customer: So that's like twenty bucks more?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Twenty dollars more per month. And here's the thing—you're currently not locked into any contract, so you could actually downgrade if you wanted to, but I think you'll be really happy with the upgrade. Plus, we're running a promotion right now where we waive the installation fee. Normally that's $89.95.

Customer: Oh, that's nice. So when would this happen? How quickly can you get me upgraded?

Agent: (typing sounds) So I have availability for an installation as early as... let me see... next Wednesday, the 19th, between 8 AM and 5 PM. Or if that doesn't work, we have Thursday morning or Friday afternoon available that week. Does one of those work for you?

Customer: Wednesday would be perfect, actually. Just, um, I'm hoping the installation doesn't take forever?

Agent: Not at all. Since you're already a Fiber customer and we're upgrading your modem, it typically takes about 30 to 45 minutes. Our technician will make sure everything is properly connected and we'll run a speed test before they leave, so you can see the difference right away.

Customer: That sounds great. Should I do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure you have access to your router—it's wherever you normally keep it. The technician will bring the new modem, but it's helpful if there's a clear path to your network setup. Other than that, no need to do anything special.

Customer: Okay, perfect. And just to confirm, that's the 1 Gig plan for $79.99?

Agent: (pause) Yes, exactly. Fiber 1 Gig for $79.99 per month, and we're waiving the $89.95 installation fee. I should mention there may be some promotional pricing available too. Let me check real quick...

Customer: Oh really? There's more discount available?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, so for new service upgrades, we currently have a three-month promotional rate of $69.99 per month, and then it goes to the regular $79.99 after that. Would that interest you?

Customer: Oh man, yes! Definitely! So $69.99 for three months?

Agent: Yes, sir. Locked in. Then $79.99 after the promotional period ends, and I'll make sure to send you a notification before that happens so there are no surprises.

Customer: Perfect. That's really helpful. I appreciate that.

Agent: You're welcome! So let me just confirm everything here. I'm going to schedule your installation for Wednesday, December 19th. Someone will contact you the day before to confirm a specific time window. You'll be upgraded to Fiber 1 Gig at the promotional rate of $69.99 for three months, then $79.99 after that, with the installation fee waived. Does all that sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect. I'm excited to get the faster speeds.

Agent: Awesome. I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all of these details, including the technician's contact information. Is the email address on file still...

Customer: [inaudible]

Agent: I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

Customer: It's still [inaudible]@gmail.com. The one with the 23 at the end.

Agent: Got it. Perfect. Well, I think we're all set. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks so much for your help, Derek. This was really easy.

Agent: Absolutely, happy to help! Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You're going to love that upgraded speed. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks again!

Agent: Bye now!
