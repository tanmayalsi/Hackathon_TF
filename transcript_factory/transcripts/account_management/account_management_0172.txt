Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I'd like to upgrade my internet service. I've had the 100 megabit plan for a while now, and it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... All right, I'm seeing your account for Sarah Mitchell at 2847 Willow Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, is that right?

Customer: That's the one, yeah. I've been on it for about three years now, and with working from home, I really need something faster. My video calls keep cutting out, and my kids are always on YouTube or playing games online, so...

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. That's a really common situation, especially with multiple people in the household using the internet at the same time. The good news is that you're in one of our fiber service areas, so we have some really great options for you. (pause) What kind of speeds were you thinking about upgrading to?

Customer: I'm not really sure, to be honest. What do you have available?

Agent: Excellent question. So with your address, we can offer you our Fiber 300 plan, which gives you 300 megabits per second download speeds, or our Fiber 500 plan with 500 meg speeds. We also have our Fiber Gig plan if you want to go all out with gigabit speeds.

Customer: Wow, okay. Is there a big price difference between those?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check your current pricing... So you're paying $79.99 a month for your Fiber 100 plan right now. If you upgrade to Fiber 300, that would be $99.99 per month. The Fiber 500 is $129.99, and our Fiber Gig is $159.99.

Customer: Hmm, so the 300 plan is only twenty dollars more?

Agent: That's right. And you'd be getting three times the speed for just twenty dollars more per month. A lot of our customers find that to be a really good value, especially if they have multiple people streaming or working from home.

Customer: Yeah, that does sound pretty reasonable. How quickly could that be installed? Do I need to have someone come out?

Agent: Great question. So the good news is that you're already connected to our fiber network, which means the upgrade is just a configuration change on our end and at the modem. We don't typically need to send a technician out for upgrades like this. We can schedule it for as soon as tomorrow, actually, or we can do it today if you'd like. It usually takes about five to ten minutes to complete, and you might experience a brief service interruption—maybe a minute or two—while we're making the changes.

Customer: Today would be awesome if that's possible. What time?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available... How does 3 PM work for you?

Customer: Perfect, that works.

Agent: Wonderful. I have you set for today at 3 PM. We'll do the upgrade over the line, so you don't need to be home or anything. Just keep an eye on your modem around that time. You might see the lights blink or reset.

Customer: Okay, great. So is there anything else I need to do, or...?

Agent: Just one more thing—I want to make sure you're aware that we're currently running a promotion where if you upgrade to Fiber 300 or higher and stay on the service for twelve months, you'll get a $50 bill credit applied to your account over the first few months. So that'll help offset some of that price difference.

Customer: Oh, nice. I didn't know about that.

Agent: Yeah, it's a pretty good deal. (pause) All right, so to recap: we're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300 today at 3 PM. Your new rate will be $99.99 per month, and you'll receive that promotional credit. You should see a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details.

Customer: Sounds good. Um, one more question—if I end up needing it to be faster than the 300, can I upgrade again?

Agent: Absolutely. You can upgrade at any time, and there's no early termination fee or anything like that. You'd just call us back, and we can make that adjustment for you. Plus, the same process applies—no technician visit needed.

Customer: Excellent. I think that's everything then.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, Sarah. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. You're all set, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (line disconnects)
