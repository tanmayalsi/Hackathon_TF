# Frontier Communications - Internet Upgrade Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet. My current service is, um... I think it's like 100 megabits or something? And it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And what name is the account under?

Customer: It's under Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, Jennifer. I'm seeing here that you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Like I said, it's just... we've got three people working from home now, and my kids are always streaming stuff, so it's gotten really slow, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually a really common situation we're seeing. So what kind of speeds were you looking to upgrade to? We have Fiber 200, Fiber 300, and then our top tier is Fiber 500.

Customer: What's the difference in price? Like, how much more would I be paying?

Agent: Great question. So your current plan is $59.99 a month. Our Fiber 200 is $74.99, the Fiber 300 is $89.99, and the Fiber 500 is $109.99. All of those come with unlimited data and the same great reliability you're getting now.

Customer: Hmm, okay. And the 300 plan... what speeds does that actually give you? Like, is that consistent or...?

Agent: So Fiber 300 gives you download speeds up to 300 megabits per second, and upload speeds up to 20 megabits per second. And with fiber, that's a dedicated connection, so you're getting consistent speeds. It's not like cable where speeds can vary depending on your neighborhood congestion.

Customer: Right, right. Okay, so 300 sounds like it might be good. But I want to ask—am I locked into another contract if I do this? Because the reason I'm calling is my promotional rate is about to end anyway.

Agent: (pause) Let me check that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so your current promo rate is ending on the 15th of next month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So if you upgrade now, we can lock in a promotional rate on the new plan as well. It's twelve months at $79.99 for the Fiber 300. And there's no contract required—you can cancel anytime after that promotional period.

Customer: Wait, $79.99? You said it was $89.99 earlier.

Agent: Right, I apologize for any confusion. That's the regular monthly rate, but since you're a valued customer and you're already in a promo period, I can definitely get you a promotional rate, which brings it down to $79.99 for the first twelve months. After that, it would be the regular $89.99.

Customer: Oh, that's... that's actually better. Okay, and I want to make sure—can I keep my same email address? Because I know sometimes they change that stuff.

Agent: Your Frontier email? Actually, let me clarify—the internet service itself won't change your email or anything like that. If you have a Frontier email address, that stays the same. Your equipment might change though, since the Fiber 300 plan uses a different modem than the 100 plan.

Customer: Okay, so I'll get a new modem?

Agent: Yes, we'll upgrade your equipment. We can either ship it to you and you can self-install, which is super easy and takes about fifteen minutes, or we can schedule a technician to come out and install it for you at no extra charge. A lot of customers appreciate having the tech come out just to make sure everything's working perfectly.

Customer: How long is the installation appointment typically?

Agent: Usually between one and two hours. And we have availability pretty much any day of the week, morning, afternoon, or evening. What works better for your schedule?

Customer: Um, probably a weekday evening? I'm working from home but... yeah, evening is easier.

Agent: Perfect. We can definitely set that up. Let me just say, just to recap before we finalize this—you're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, your promotional rate is $79.99 a month for twelve months, after which it would be $89.99. We'll send you new equipment and schedule a technician visit at no additional cost. Does all of that sound good?

Customer: Yes, that sounds good. Oh, one more thing—do you guys still do that thing where you throw in HBO or something?

Agent: (pause) You know what, let me check what current promotions we have available. (typing sounds) Okay, so right now we're not running a promotional bundle with HBO, but we do have a couple options. We could add our Frontier Secure package, which includes antivirus protection and tech support, at $9.99 a month. Or I can check if there are any other add-ons that might interest you.

Customer: Nah, we don't really need that. I think just the upgrade is fine.

Agent: Absolutely. Okay, so I'm going to get you scheduled for a technician visit. What evening this week works best for you? We have [inaudible] available... let me see... Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday?

Customer: Thursday?

Agent: Thursday works great. Let me get you a specific time window. How about between 4 and 6 PM on Thursday?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) Okay, so I have you scheduled for Thursday between 4 and 6 PM. You should receive a confirmation email within the next couple hours, and a technician will reach out to you on Thursday morning to confirm they're on their way. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Jennifer?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much.

Agent: My pleasure! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and enjoy those faster speeds. You're going to notice a huge difference. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: Nope, that's it!

Agent: Perfect. Have a great day, Jennifer!

Customer: You too, thank you!

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier!
