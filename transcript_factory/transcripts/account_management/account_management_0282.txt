Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you calling in. I'd be happy to help you find the right plan. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got you here. Okay, so I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan at $59.99 a month. Is that still the right service address on file?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct. We're in Des Moines on Maple Street.

Agent: Great. And what's prompting the upgrade? Are you experiencing any issues with your current speeds, or has your internet usage just increased?

Customer: Well, my wife started working from home full-time about six months ago, and I've got two teenagers who are always streaming stuff. Netflix, TikTok, gaming... it's basically constant. We're getting a lot of buffering, especially when multiple people are online. I work from home too sometimes, so I need something more reliable.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. With multiple users and streaming and work activities, a hundred megs just isn't going to cut it. (pause) So we have a couple of options for you. We offer Fiber 300, which gives you 300 megabits per second, and that's $79.99 a month. Then we've got Fiber 500 at $99.99, and our top tier is Fiber Gig at $129.99 a month for gigabit speeds.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference between those really? Like, would 300 be enough for what I'm describing?

Agent: That's a great question. So with 300 megs, you should be able to handle multiple simultaneous activities—streaming in 4K, video conferencing, online gaming, all at the same time without too much issue. The 500 plan is really if you want more of a buffer, especially if you have people constantly downloading large files or if you just want that extra headroom for the future-proofing aspect. And the Gig plan... (pause) honestly, that's overkill for most households unless you're running a small business from home or you have like six or seven heavy users.

Customer: Hmm. I think 300 sounds like it might be good. But before I commit, what kind of pricing are we looking at long-term? Are there any introductory rates or anything?

Agent: Good thinking. So the Fiber 300 is $79.99 a month, and that's our standard rate. Now, I do have a promotional offer available right now. If you sign a two-year agreement, I can get you the first three months at just $59.99—so basically the same as what you're paying now—and then it goes to the regular $79.99 after that.

Customer: Okay, so after three months it jumps up twenty bucks. What happens after the two years?

Agent: After the two-year contract term, the rate remains $79.99 per month, but it could potentially increase in the future. Frontier does adjust rates periodically, but you'd have to renew or renegotiate at that point. Most of our long-term customers find the value is still really strong even with potential rate adjustments.

Customer: And there aren't any installation fees or equipment charges?

Agent: (pause) Good question. So typically there's no installation fee since you already have Frontier services with us. However, you would need a new modem that's compatible with the higher speeds. That's a one-time cost of $99.99, or we can actually roll that into your monthly bill as $8.33 a month for twelve months if that works better for your budget.

Customer: [inaudible] ...yeah, let me think about that. Can I upgrade just the service for now without committing to the modem purchase?

Agent: I understand where you're coming from, but honestly, your current modem probably won't support the 300 meg speeds we're talking about. You'd actually end up capped at lower speeds without the new equipment. So it's really necessary to make this upgrade worthwhile. But like I said, we can definitely spread that cost out if that makes it easier.

Customer: Yeah, okay. The spread-out option sounds better. And how long would installation take? Can you do it soon?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great. So for you, since it's just a modem swap and you already have our fiber line, we can actually schedule a technician to come out. Looks like we have availability... Thursday of next week, or the following Monday. We typically have a four-hour window. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Thursday next week should be fine. What time range?

Agent: (typing sounds) We have either 8 AM to noon or 1 PM to 5 PM available.

Customer: Let's do the afternoon slot, 1 to 5.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I'm putting that on the calendar for you. And just so you know, we'll text and email you confirmation with all those details. Is the phone number and email on file still good?

Customer: Uh, the phone is fine, but my email might have changed. Let me give you the new one... it's [inaudible]... actually, I'll just update it online. That's easier.

Agent: You're absolutely right, you can do that through your My Frontier account anytime. (pause) So to recap, I'm upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300. Your promotional rate is $59.99 for the first three months, then $79.99 thereafter. The modem fee of $99.99 will be split as $8.33 a month over twelve months. Installation is scheduled for Thursday, January 16th between 1 and 5 PM. Does all of that sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that all sounds good. When does the speed increase actually take effect? Like, will I notice it right away?

Agent: You should notice it pretty much immediately once the technician gets the new modem installed and activated. Could be within minutes, honestly. (pause) And hey, if you're not satisfied with the speeds or service for any reason in the first thirty days, just give us a call and we can discuss your options.

Customer: Okay, great. And is there anything else I should know? Any hidden fees or anything?

Agent: No hidden fees. You'll see the modem charge broken down on your bill, and then the service charge increases from $59.99 to $79.99 after the promotional period. That's it. Oh, and just a heads up—if you ever want to cancel the contract early, there is an early termination fee of $150, but most customers don't need to worry about that.

Customer: Alright, sounds fair. I think we're good to go.

Agent: Excellent. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for walking me through all this.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks so much for choosing Frontier Communications. You should be all set, and we'll see the technician out to you Thursday. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: (background noise fades) Bye now.
