Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just not cutting it anymore, especially with my kids doing remote schooling and my wife working from home.

Agent: I completely understand. We're seeing a lot of that these days. I'd be happy to help you find a better plan. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, got it here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine for a while, but now we're all hitting it hard at the same time, you know? Streaming, video calls, gaming... it's just too slow. We've been getting a lot of buffering and lag.

Agent: Yeah, that makes sense. Fiber 100 is great for basic usage, but once you've got multiple people streaming and doing bandwidth-heavy activities, you're gonna start seeing those performance issues. The good news is we've got some excellent options that'll handle that no problem. What kind of speeds are you thinking you'd need?

Customer: Um, I'm not really sure, to be honest. What would you recommend?

Agent: (pause) Well, for a household with three to four people doing simultaneous streaming, video conferencing, and some gaming, I'd usually recommend at least our Fiber 300 plan. That gives you 300 Mbps, which is plenty of headroom. But if you want to future-proof yourself a bit, our Fiber 500 is also really popular right now.

Customer: What's the price difference?

Agent: (typing sounds) Good question. Let me see here... Your current plan is $79.99 a month. The Fiber 300 would be $109.99 a month, so about thirty bucks more. And the Fiber 500 would run you $139.99.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. (pause) So is there like... a promotion or anything? I've been a customer for how long?

Agent: Let me check that for you. (typing) Looks like you've been with us for four years now. That's fantastic. And actually, you're in luck—we do have a promotion running right now. For new service upgrades, we can lock in $99.99 a month for the Fiber 300 plan for the first twelve months. After that, it goes to the regular rate.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad actually. So it would be $99.99 for a year?

Agent: Exactly. That's $10 less than the regular price for that tier.

Customer: (pause) Okay, and if I go with the Fiber 500?

Agent: For the 500, we can do $129.99 for the first year, and then it moves to the standard $139.99 after that.

Customer: Hmm. What's the installation process like? Would someone need to come out to my house?

Agent: That's a good question. Since you're already on our Fiber 100, the good news is you likely already have the fiber infrastructure in place. (typing) Let me just confirm... yes, your line is already equipped. So the upgrade is mostly on the backend. We won't need to send a technician out unless there's an issue. It's a pretty seamless process that we can handle remotely.

Customer: Oh, that's great. I was worried about having someone out here with the kids and everything.

Agent: I know, I totally get it. No, this should be simple. We'd just need to schedule a time for the upgrade, which is usually within a couple of days, and there might be a brief service interruption—maybe fifteen to twenty minutes—while we provision the new speeds on your line.

Customer: Okay, okay. So if I do the Fiber 300 with the promo, when could that be activated?

Agent: (typing) Let me check availability... How does Thursday between 10 AM and noon work for you? That's actually the earliest we have open.

Customer: Thursday? This Thursday?

Agent: Yes, this Thursday. We can push it through and get you set up for then.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, yeah, that actually works. I'll be home anyway.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) So just to confirm, you want to upgrade to the Fiber 300 plan at $99.99 per month for the first year. Is there anything else I should know? Any other services you're interested in? We also offer TV packages or—

Customer: No, no. Just the internet upgrade for now. Maybe down the road, but definitely not right now.

Agent: Completely understandable. (pause, typing) Alright, and I'm gonna need to verify your service address. What's the street address on your account?

Customer: It's 4827 Maple Ridge Drive, Spokane, Washington 99205.

Agent: (typing) Got it. And the best contact number to reach you on Thursday?

Customer: That would be... 555-0147, same as the account.

Agent: Perfect. So to recap everything: You're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, the promotional rate is $99.99 monthly for twelve months, then regular pricing after that. Installation is scheduled for Thursday of this week, between 10 AM and noon. You should expect maybe a 15 to 20-minute service interruption during that window. We'll send you a confirmation email within the hour with all these details.

Customer: Awesome. Thank you so much.

Agent: You're welcome! And just so you know, if you have any issues or questions before Thursday, you can always reach our support team at 1-800-FRONTIER. They're available 24/7.

Customer: Great, I appreciate it.

Agent: It's my pleasure! Thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You're gonna love the faster speeds. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
