Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan, and honestly, it's been great, but I'm working from home more now and I'm looking to upgrade to something faster. What do you have available?

Agent: Awesome, I'm glad you've been happy with your service! Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're in... looks like you're in the Scottsdale area, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, Scottsdale, Arizona.

Agent: Great! So we actually have some excellent options for you. In your area, we offer our 1 gig fiber plan, which is our fastest residential option. That's up to 1 gigabit per second download speeds. We also have a 750 meg plan if you wanted something in between. What's your main use case? Like, are you doing video calls, large file uploads, or...?

Customer: Yeah, I do a lot of video conferencing—I'm in marketing—and I've been uploading these large campaign files to the cloud pretty regularly. Sometimes I'll have multiple people streaming during the day too.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so the 1 gig plan would be perfect for you then. You'd have plenty of headroom for all of that. Honestly, the 750 would probably work fine, but at that price point, I'd recommend just going with the gig. You're future-proofing yourself, you know?

Customer: Yeah, that makes sense. What's the pricing difference?

Agent: (typing sounds) So right now, your 500 meg plan is... looks like you're at $79.99 a month. The 750 meg would be $99.99, and the 1 gig is $109.99 for the first year. After that, it goes to the regular rate of $119.99.

Customer: Oh, interesting. So it's only a ten-dollar difference between the 750 and the gig?

Agent: Yeah, exactly. Most people think it's worth it to just go with the full gig at that point. Plus, you'd get our upgraded router included, which supports WiFi 6 technology, so you'll see better performance on all your wireless devices too.

Customer: That's pretty good. Do I have to get a new modem, or...?

Agent: (pause) So you'd get a new router for sure—that's part of the 1 gig package. Your current modem should actually be compatible, but I can make a note on your account to have our tech team verify that when we process the upgrade. They might swap it out if needed, just to make sure you're getting the optimal setup.

Customer: Okay, and how long does the upgrade take?

Agent: So we can get you scheduled for an installation, which usually takes about two to three hours. We have availability... (typing sounds) ...next Thursday or Friday, or we have some openings the following Monday if that doesn't work. Would any of those work for you?

Customer: Next Friday would be great. Do I need to be there the whole time?

Agent: You'll need to be there when the tech arrives, yeah. Usually they call about 30 minutes before they're on their way. The appointment window is typically between like 8 AM and 6 PM—what time works best for you?

Customer: Um, morning would be better. Like 9 or 10 AM?

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm putting you down for Friday between 9 and 11 AM. They'll call you before they head over. Now, just to confirm everything—you're upgrading from 500 meg to the 1 gig fiber plan at $109.99 per month for the first 12 months, then $119.99 after that. Does that all sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that works for me. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?

Agent: Nothing major. Just make sure your gateway—that's where the fiber comes into your home—is still easily accessible. Our tech will be working with that. And if you have any devices that are hardwired to your modem right now, just know that they'll be briefly disconnected during the installation, but they'll all come back up automatically.

Customer: Got it. And I guess my bill will just update automatically?

Agent: Yep, the changes will be reflected on your next billing cycle. You should get a confirmation email shortly with all your appointment details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and I hope you enjoy that gigabit speed. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: (background noise fades) Bye now.
