Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. We've got some great options available. Before we dive in, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. And what's your name?

Customer: It's Jennifer. Jennifer Patterson.

Agent: Thanks Jennifer. Okay, so I'm seeing here you've been with us for about three years on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that the service you're currently using?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. It was fine when I first got it, but honestly, I'm working from home now and my husband streams constantly. We're just getting a lot of buffering, especially when we're both online at the same time. It's frustrating.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I hear that a lot, especially with more people working remotely these days. The 100 Mbps can definitely get stretched thin with multiple users. What kind of speeds are you looking to upgrade to?

Customer: I'm not sure, honestly. What would you recommend?

Agent: Well, it depends on your usage, but given what you described—working from home plus streaming—I'd say our Fiber 300 or Fiber 500 would be a solid fit. The 300 is great for simultaneous video conferencing and streaming, and the 500 is our top tier if you want that extra headroom for future-proofing.

Customer: What's the price difference between those two?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me pull up our current pricing. So our Fiber 300 is $79.99 a month, and the Fiber 500 is $99.99. You're currently at $64.99 for the 100, so that's about a $15 to $35 increase depending on which way you go.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Do you have any promotions or anything?

Agent: Great question. Actually, yes. Since you've been a loyal customer for three years, I can apply a new customer promotion to you. We have a twelve-month rate lock at $69.99 for the Fiber 300. So effectively you'd only be paying about $5 more than you are now, and it locks in for a year.

Customer: Oh wow, really? That's... that's actually pretty good. Can I think about it for a—

Agent: Of course! But I should mention, this promotion is only available through the end of the month, so you'd want to decide fairly soon if you're interested.

Customer: Okay, okay. Yeah, I think the 300 sounds like what we need. What would the process be? Do you have to send someone out?

Agent: Good choice. (typing sounds) So, since you already have our Fiber infrastructure in your home, we might be able to do this remotely, but let me check your equipment status. (pause) Okay, so your current modem and router are... actually, they should be compatible with the upgrade. We can push through a configuration update to your modem, and the speed increase should take effect within 24 hours. No technician visit needed.

Customer: Wait, seriously? It's that easy?

Agent: It really is! Of course, if you run into any issues during that window, just give us a call back and we'll get you sorted. But in most cases, it's seamless.

Customer: That's awesome. So when can this start?

Agent: I can actually process this upgrade right now if you'd like, and we can schedule it to activate tomorrow morning at 2 AM. That way there's no service interruption during the day.

Customer: Tomorrow? Perfect. Yeah, let's do it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Excellent. Just to confirm, I'm upgrading your account from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, applying the promotional rate of $69.99 locked for twelve months. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: And your service address is still 447 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yep, that's it.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Okay, so I'm getting an order confirmation number here. Your confirmation number is 789452. The upgrade will activate tomorrow morning at 2 AM. You should see the speed increase immediately after that. We'll also send you a confirmation email with all these details.

Customer: Great. Is there anything I need to do on my end?

Agent: Nope, we'll handle everything. Just restart your modem once you get that email tomorrow, just to be safe, but it should reconnect automatically. Oh, and one more thing—your bill will be prorated for this month since we're mid-cycle, so you'll see a small adjustment when you get your next statement.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you so much, Marcus. This is really helpful.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. I'm glad I could help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: My pleasure. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we hope you enjoy the faster speeds! Have a great day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
