Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently a customer and I'm interested in upgrading my internet speed. My plan is getting a little slow for what I need.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! I can definitely look into some upgrade options for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I've got your account. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine for a while, but my wife started working from home full-time, and we've got the kids doing remote learning some days, so... it's just not cutting it anymore. We're getting a lot of buffering.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. That's actually pretty common, especially with multiple people streaming or video conferencing simultaneously. What kind of speeds were you thinking about upgrading to?

Customer: Um, I'm not really sure what would be good. What do you have available at my location?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great question. So, at your address in Boise, we have a few options. You can upgrade to our Fiber 250 plan, which would give you 250 megabits per second download speeds. Or we also offer Fiber 500, which is 500 megabits per second. Both are available in your area.

Customer: Wow, okay. What's the price difference?

Agent: Good question. So your current plan is $69.99 a month. The Fiber 250 would be $89.99 a month, and the Fiber 500 is $119.99 a month. However... (pause) ...I'm actually looking at some promotions we have running right now, and I can offer you the Fiber 250 at $79.99 for the first year, which is a nice savings.

Customer: That's better. Honestly, what would you recommend? Like, would 250 be enough for what I'm dealing with?

Agent: So, here's what I'd say—with multiple people doing video calls and streaming at the same time, the 250 plan would definitely be a solid improvement over what you have now. It should handle all of that pretty comfortably. The 500 would give you even more headroom, but for your situation, I think 250 is probably the sweet spot, especially at that promotional rate.

Customer: Okay, that sounds reasonable. How quickly can you upgrade it? Can you do it today?

Agent: Actually, yes. Since you already have our fiber infrastructure at your location, it's just a plan change, so it should be active... (typing sounds) ...typically by tonight or tomorrow morning at the latest. There's no technician visit needed or anything like that.

Customer: Oh, that's great! That's better than I expected.

Agent: Yeah, you're lucky with fiber—it makes these upgrades super easy. So just to confirm, you want to move from the Fiber 100 to the Fiber 250 at the promotional rate of $79.99 for the first year?

Customer: Yes, let's do it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And just so you're aware, after the first year, it'll go to the regular price of $89.99 a month. Is that okay?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. That's still reasonable.

Agent: Awesome. And your billing address is still 1247 Riverside Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. (pause) Alright, I'm processing this upgrade right now... (typing sounds) ...and it's all set! Your new plan is active as of today. You should see the speed improvement within the next 24 hours. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Derek. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we hope the faster speeds help out with everything going on at home. If you have any issues or questions, just give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
