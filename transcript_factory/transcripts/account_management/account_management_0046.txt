Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm showing you're currently on our Fiber 50 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've had it for about... I don't know, three years maybe? And it was fine at first, but now with my kids doing school from home and my wife working remote, it's just too slow. We're constantly getting lag.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. Three people streaming and video conferencing at the same time will definitely test those speeds. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you thinking maybe doubling up to our Fiber 100 plan, or would you want to go even higher?

Customer: What do you have available?

Agent: Great question. So we have several options in your area. You've got Fiber 100, Fiber 200, and our top tier is Fiber 500. (pause) The Fiber 500 is really popular with families in your situation—lots of devices, multiple video calls going on at once. But it really depends on your budget and what you think you'll need.

Customer: Hmm, what's the price difference? I don't want to go overboard, but I also don't want to be stuck again in a year.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so your current Fiber 50 is $59.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, sounds about right.

Agent: Right. So if you upgrade to Fiber 100, that would be $79.99 a month. Fiber 200 would be $99.99, and our Fiber 500 is $129.99 a month. (pause) Now, I do have a promotion running right now for new service tiers. If you upgrade today, I can lock you in at $89.99 for the Fiber 200 for the first year, then it goes to the regular price.

Customer: Oh, really? That's actually not bad. (pause) What about installation? Do I have to have someone come out?

Agent: That's a great question. So with Fiber, the good news is we usually don't need to do a full installation visit if you already have our equipment in your home. We'd just need to push an update to your modem and router, which takes maybe 20 minutes or so. You might see a brief service interruption during that time—maybe 10 or 15 minutes—but that's it. Now, if for some reason we need to do any line upgrades on your end, we might schedule a technician, but I'm not seeing anything that would require that in your case.

Customer: Oh perfect. So when could that happen?

Agent: (typing sounds) Well, we can schedule it for as soon as tomorrow, actually. Or if you prefer later in the week, we have availability Thursday or Friday. What works best for you?

Customer: Tomorrow would be great, actually. Um, what time window?

Agent: Alright, so tomorrow we have a morning window between 8 AM and noon, or an afternoon window between 1 and 5 PM. Which would you prefer?

Customer: I think the afternoon is better. My wife's got meetings in the morning.

Agent: Perfect, I'm going to schedule you for the afternoon window, 1 to 5 PM tomorrow. (typing sounds) You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes. Is the phone number we have on file 555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, the email would be... (pause) [inaudible] ...at Gmail. Is that still current?

Customer: Yeah, that's good.

Agent: Excellent. So let me just summarize what we're setting up for you. We're upgrading you from Fiber 50 to Fiber 200. That's going to be $89.99 a month for the first year with the promotion, then $99.99 after that. We'll be updating your modem and router tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, and you should experience about 10 to 15 minutes of downtime during that process. You'll get a text and email confirmation shortly.

Customer: That sounds great. One question though—is there any kind of contract or early termination fee if I need to cancel or change it later?

Agent: That's a smart question. So our Fiber service doesn't have a long-term contract requirement. You can change or cancel anytime without any penalty. The only thing I'd mention is we do ask for 30 days' notice if you want to cancel service, but there's no early termination fee or anything like that.

Customer: Okay, that's good to know. I think I'm ready to go ahead with this then.

Agent: Awesome! I'm really glad we could get you set up. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for your help, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You should see a big improvement with those speeds tomorrow. If you have any issues at all during the update process, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!
