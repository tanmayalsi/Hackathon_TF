Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with your service, but I'm thinking I might need to upgrade my internet speed.

Agent: Oh, that's great to hear! I'm glad you've been satisfied with us. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I've got you. I'm showing you're currently on our Fiber 300 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. It's been fine for a while, but my work's changed. I'm working from home a lot more now, and I've got my partner working from home too, and we're constantly streaming, video calls, all that stuff. It's just... it's getting a little slow sometimes.

Agent: I totally understand. Multiple people working from home can definitely put a strain on bandwidth. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking at? Are you thinking you'd like to go up to our Fiber 500, or were you curious about the gig?

Customer: Hmm, well... what's the difference, and what would that run me? I don't want to go crazy if I don't need to.

Agent: Great question. So the Fiber 500 gives you 500 megabits per second download and 20 megabits per second upload. That's usually plenty for a couple of people working from home, streaming, video conferencing—all of that. Right now, that plan is $79.99 a month.

Customer: Okay, and then the gig?

Agent: The Gigabit plan is our top tier. You're getting speeds up to 1 gigabit per second download and 50 megs upload. That's usually for people who are really heavy users—gamers, content creators, or larger households. That one's $109.99 a month. (pause) But honestly, I think the 500 might be a sweet spot for your situation.

Customer: What's the price difference between what I'm paying now and the 500?

Agent: (typing sounds) So you're currently at... $59.99 for the Fiber 300. The upgrade to Fiber 500 would be $79.99, so that's an additional $20 a month.

Customer: Okay, that's not too bad. Um, is there any kind of promotional rate or anything like that?

Agent: Let me check that for you. (pause) I'm seeing we have a promotion running right now where new upgrades get the first three months at a discounted rate. So you'd be looking at $59.99 for the first three months, and then it goes to the regular $79.99 after that.

Customer: Oh, that's actually pretty good! So I'd save like 60 bucks over three months?

Agent: Exactly, you got it. (pause) And another thing I should mention—there's no equipment fee for the upgrade. You'll need a new modem to support those speeds, but we can either ship that out to you or you can pick it up at one of our service centers.

Customer: Can you ship it? I'd rather not have to drive somewhere.

Agent: Absolutely, no problem. We can ship it out, and it typically arrives within 3 to 5 business days. We'll include instructions on how to swap it out yourself—it's pretty straightforward, just unplug the old one, plug in the new one. But if you need us to come out and set it up, we can arrange that too for a small fee.

Customer: No, I think I can handle plugging in a modem. (laughs) How soon could you get this activated?

Agent: (typing sounds) Well, we can activate the service upgrade right now if you'd like. The new modem should arrive by next Friday at the latest. Once it arrives and you've swapped it in, you'll be good to go. You might see an immediate speed boost as soon as the upgrade is processed on our end though.

Customer: That sounds good. Yeah, let's do it.

Agent: Excellent! Let me just verify some information with you to make sure everything's correct. The service address is still... (pause) 1428 Ridgemont Drive, apartment 3C?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: And the best contact number is the 555-0147?

Customer: Actually, you can use my cell—it's 555-0289.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've updated that. All right, so I'm going to process this upgrade for you right now. This should only take about a minute. (pause) Okay, and... we're all set! The upgrade is active in our system as of right now. You're authorized for the Fiber 500 speed tier, and the modem is being prepared for shipment. You should receive a tracking number via email within the next 24 hours.

Customer: Great! That's awesome. Thanks for doing that so quickly.

Agent: You're welcome! Just a couple of quick things before we wrap up. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it.

Agent: Perfect. Just remember, when the modem arrives, you'll want to swap it out, and you should see those speeds right away. If you have any issues with the setup or the speeds aren't where you'd expect them to be, just give us a call back and we'll troubleshoot with you.

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Marcus!

Agent: My pleasure! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your business. You have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!
