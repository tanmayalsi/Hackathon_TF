Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've had Frontier for about three years now, and honestly, my current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! I appreciate your loyalty as a long-time customer. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, or the address where you're receiving service?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147. That's the number on the bill.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got it here. Okay, so I'm seeing you're currently on our 200 megabit plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. And look, it was great for a while, but now I'm working from home most of the time, and my wife is streaming stuff, the kids are doing online school... it's just getting really slow. We're constantly buffering and it's frustrating.

Agent: I totally understand. Yeah, with multiple people on the network doing different activities, 200 megs can definitely get stretched thin. (pause) So, what kind of speeds were you thinking about upgrading to?

Customer: I mean, I'm not really sure what the options are. What do you recommend?

Agent: Great question. So we have several tiers available in your area. We currently offer 400 megabits, which would be a nice step up from where you are. We also have our 1 gigabit fiber service, which is our top tier. That one's really popular with customers who have multiple people working and streaming simultaneously.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference in price? Like, what am I paying now versus what would I be paying?

Agent: (typing sounds) So your current plan is $79.99 a month. Our 400 meg plan is $99.99, and the 1 gig plan runs $129.99 monthly.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) And do I have to sign a new contract or anything?

Agent: That's a good question. So we have a couple options. If you go month-to-month, those prices stay the same. However, if you're willing to commit to a two-year agreement, I can actually get you a promotional rate on the gig service. I could put you at $99.99 for the first year, then it goes to regular pricing after that.

Customer: Oh, really? So I'd be paying the same as the 400 meg plan for the first year?

Agent: Exactly right. So you'd get over five times the speed, and you'd actually be paying less than the 400 meg plan on a month-to-month basis.

Customer: (pause) That actually sounds pretty good. I think I'd rather go with the 1 gig then. But walk me through what happens next with the installation and all that.

Agent: Perfect choice. (typing sounds) So, the good news is that your address is already fiber-ready, which means we won't need to do any outside line work. A technician will need to come to your home to install the new equipment and get everything configured. That usually takes about an hour, maybe an hour and a half.

Customer: Okay, and when could they come out?

Agent: Let me check availability. (pause, typing sounds) We have some openings this Thursday between 8 AM and noon, or we have some afternoon slots next Tuesday between 1 and 5 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: This Thursday would be great. The morning slot, like before noon.

Agent: Excellent. So I'm going to schedule you for Thursday, [inaudible] between 8 and noon. The technician will bring the new modem and router. You'll want to make sure someone's home during that window.

Customer: Yeah, I'll be here. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Not really. Just make sure you have a good spot picked out for your modem and router—ideally somewhere central in your home for the best coverage. The technician will take care of all the connections and testing. Oh, and you can keep your current modem; we'll swap it out during the visit.

Customer: Great. Um, is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Let me just... (typing sounds) ...confirm the details. So we're upgrading you to the 1 gigabit plan at $99.99 for year one with a two-year commitment. Installation is scheduled for Thursday morning between 8 AM and noon. We'll waive the installation fee as well since you're a current customer.

Customer: Perfect. That sounds great.

Agent: Awesome. You should receive a confirmation email and text message within the next few minutes with your appointment details and a reference number. If you need to reschedule for any reason, just let us know as soon as possible.

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Derek. I appreciate the help.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You're going to love the gig speeds. If you have any questions before Thursday, just give us a call back.

Customer: Thanks again. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Bye now!
