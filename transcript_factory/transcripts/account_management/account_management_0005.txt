Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've had Frontier for about three years now, and I'm just... I'm not getting the speeds I need anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you calling in! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here. Okay, I'm seeing you're currently on our 100 megabits per second plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine for a while, but now I'm working from home most days, and my kids are doing remote learning a couple times a week, and... it just feels slow. We're always buffering on Netflix or whatever.

Agent: I totally understand. A hundred megs can definitely get stretched thin with multiple people streaming and working from home. (pause) Let me ask you—what kind of activities are you mainly doing online? Like, are you doing video calls, uploading large files, that sort of thing?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. Video calls are the big one. I do Zoom calls throughout the day for work, and I hate when it keeps freezing up, you know? It's embarrassing.

Agent: Yeah, that's frustrating. Okay, so based on what you're telling me, I'd actually recommend looking at our 400 meg plan or possibly even our 1 gigabit option. The gig plan would definitely future-proof you, but it depends on your budget. Do either of those sound interesting to you?

Customer: Uh, well... what's the price difference? I'm on, like, seventy-five a month right now, I think?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check your current pricing. Okay, I'm showing you at $79.99 per month. So if you upgraded to our 400 meg plan, that would be $119.99 per month, and the 1 gig plan is $149.99 per month. Now, I should mention—we have a promotion running right now for new plan activations where we can lock in $99.99 for the 400 meg plan for the first year.

Customer: Oh, okay. (pause) And after the first year?

Agent: It would go to the regular rate of $119.99. But honestly, the speeds are night and day compared to what you're experiencing now. Most of our customers who upgrade to 400 megs are really satisfied. You won't have that buffering issue anymore.

Customer: Hmm, and what about the gigabit? Is there a deal on that one too?

Agent: The gig plan doesn't have a promotional rate at the moment, but I can definitely see if there's any flexibility there. Let me put you on a quick hold while I check with my supervisor—just one second.

Customer: Oh, sure, no problem.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Okay, I'm back. So I spoke with my supervisor, and because you've been a loyal customer for three years, I can actually offer you the 1 gig plan at $139.99 for your first year instead of the regular $149.99. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) That's... actually pretty good. So I'd be getting gigabit speeds for $139.99 the first year?

Agent: Exactly right. And just to be clear, that's a huge jump in performance. You're looking at roughly ten times the speed of what you have now. Your video calls will be crystal clear, and you'll be able to stream 4K on multiple devices without any issues.

Customer: [inaudible] that sounds great, actually. What would I need to do? Do I need a new modem or anything?

Agent: Great question. So our gigabit speeds do require our newer fiber modem, which we'll actually swap out for free. A technician would come out to your location and handle the installation and equipment swap. It usually takes about thirty to forty-five minutes.

Customer: Okay, and when could someone come out? Like, is there availability soon?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability in your area. What days work best for you? We typically have appointments available between 8 AM and 5 PM on weekdays, or I can check weekend availability too.

Customer: Um, weekday mornings are better for me if possible. Like, I could probably do next Tuesday or Wednesday morning?

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm seeing availability on Tuesday, December 12th between 8 and 10 AM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, Tuesday morning works. That's good.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) Okay, so I've scheduled a technician visit for December 12th between 8 and 10 AM. You'll receive a confirmation email and text message with those details. The technician will bring the new modem, install it, and get you all set up on the gigabit plan.

Customer: Great, thank you. Um, one more thing—is there anything I need to do before the technician gets there?

Agent: No, you don't need to do anything. Just make sure someone's home to let them in. They'll take care of everything else. Oh, and just to confirm—we'll be charging you $139.99 per month for the first year, then it goes to $149.99. Your billing cycle will start on the date of installation, which would be the 12th.

Customer: Perfect. I think I'm all set then.

Agent: Wonderful! And hey, just one more thing—I want to make sure you're all set. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. This was actually a really smooth process. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! I really appreciate your business, and I'm sure you're going to love the new speeds. If you have any issues before or after the installation, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Have a good one.

Agent: You as well. Take care!
