# Frontier Communications - Internet Service Upgrade

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. I've been with Frontier for about three years now and my current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! I totally understand – internet needs change over time. Before we dive in, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up for you here. Just one second... okay, I've got you. I'm showing you're currently on our Fiber 300 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. My download speed was supposed to be 300 Mbps but honestly it feels slower than that sometimes. And my wife's been complaining because she works from home now – she's on video calls all day – and when I'm streaming or downloading stuff, it gets all choppy on her end.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, that makes total sense. Video conferencing can really eat up bandwidth. So you're looking for something with more capacity then?

Customer: Exactly. Like, what's the next tier up from the 300?

Agent: Great question. So we have a few options for you. We offer Fiber 500, which gives you 500 Mbps download speeds, and then we also have our Fiber 1 Gig plan, which is 1000 Mbps – so that's our gigabit service.

Customer: Wow, okay. What's the difference in price between those?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we can do for you. So the Fiber 500 would be $79.99 a month, and the Fiber 1 Gig is $99.99 a month. That's the regular rate. Now, I'm looking at your account here – you've been a great customer with us, never missed a payment – so I can actually offer you a promotional rate for the first 12 months.

Customer: Oh really? That's nice of you. What kind of promotion are we talking about?

Agent: Well, for the Fiber 500, I can get you down to $59.99 for the first year, and for the Fiber 1 Gig, I can do $79.99 for the first year. After that, it goes to the regular rate.

Customer: Hmm, that's pretty good. So the gigabit plan would be $79.99 for a year and then jump to $99.99?

Agent: That's correct, yeah. But honestly, with two people using the internet heavily – your wife working from home, and you streaming and downloading – I really think the 1 Gig plan is going to give you the best experience. You won't have those slowdowns anymore.

Customer: That does sound appealing. Would I need new equipment? Like a new modem or anything?

Agent: (pause) That's a great question. So here's the thing – our Fiber 1 Gig service does require our newer modem and router combo unit. The good news is we can waive the installation fee and the equipment fee for you – that's usually a $99 fee – so we'll get that installed at no charge.

Customer: Oh, that's... that's actually really good. When could you have someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check the availability in your area. What days work best for you? We typically have morning or afternoon windows.

Customer: Uh, tomorrow is Friday... I could do late morning? Like around 10 or 11?

Agent: (pause) Let me see... (typing sounds) Okay, I'm showing we can do tomorrow between 10 AM and 12 PM. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works perfectly. My wife will be home anyway.

Agent: Excellent. So just to recap here – we're upgrading you from Fiber 300 to Fiber 1 Gig. The promotional rate is $79.99 per month for the first 12 months, then it goes to the regular rate of $99.99. We're waiving the installation fee and equipment fee. And our technician will be out tomorrow between 10 and noon.

Customer: That sounds great. Just to confirm – I'm gonna keep my same email and everything, right? I don't have to change anything?

Agent: Right, absolutely. Your email and all your account details stay exactly the same. The only thing that's changing is the speed and your modem. The technician will swap out the equipment tomorrow, make sure everything's working perfectly, and you'll be good to go.

Customer: Perfect. And should I expect any downtime during that?

Agent: Good question. So the installation typically takes about 30 to 45 minutes, and yes, you will be without internet for... probably 20 or 30 minutes during that process while we make the switch. So just give your wife a heads up in case she has any calls scheduled during that window.

Customer: Okay, I'll let her know. Thanks for that heads up.

Agent: Of course. And just so you have it – is the phone number we're reaching you at the best one to call if the technician needs to reschedule or if there's any issue?

Customer: Yeah, that's the cell phone. That's fine.

Agent: Perfect. So we're all set. You should be receiving a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details – the appointment time, the technician's contact info, everything. Do you have any other questions for me today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I'm excited to try out the gigabit speeds, honestly. My wife's gonna be happy not having to deal with the lag anymore.

Agent: (laughs) I'm sure she will be. We really appreciate your business, and thank you for choosing Frontier for your upgrade. You're going to love that 1 Gig service. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: Nope, that's it. Thanks Derek, I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Have a great day, and we'll see you tomorrow!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
