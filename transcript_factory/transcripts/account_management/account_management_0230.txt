Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, I've had your service for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that! Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Oh sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this Derek speaking with... (pause) ...with Michael Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. So you mentioned you're looking to upgrade your service. What's been going on with your current plan? Are you experiencing slow speeds, or...?

Customer: Well, it's more like... I work from home now, right? And my wife, she streams a lot during the day. Netflix, that kind of thing. So we're both on video calls sometimes, and everything just gets really sluggish. I think I'm on the 200 meg plan right now?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 200 plan. That makes sense. With multiple devices running simultaneously and video streaming, yeah, you could definitely benefit from an upgrade. Have you thought about what speed range you'd like to move to?

Customer: Um, I'm not really sure what the options are. What do you have available at my address?

Agent: Let me check that for you real quick. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so at your location, we can offer you our Fiber 500 plan, or if you want to go all-out, we have our Fiber Gig plan, which is one gigabit per second. That's our top tier.

Customer: Wow, a gigabit? That seems... that seems like overkill, honestly. What's the price difference?

Agent: So your current plan is $79.99 a month. The Fiber 500 would be $99.99 a month, and the Fiber Gig is $129.99 monthly.

Customer: (pause) So it's thirty bucks more for the 500, and fifty more for the gig?

Agent: Correct, yes. Now, I should mention we do have a promotional rate available if you're interested. For new upgrades, we can get you the Fiber 500 at $89.99 for the first year, then it goes to the regular rate.

Customer: Okay, that's not too bad. What about the gigabit plan? Is there a promo on that?

Agent: We can do $119.99 for the first twelve months on the Fiber Gig plan as well.

Customer: (pause) You know what, let me think about this. I mean, honestly, I think the 500 would probably be enough. My wife's not going to need a gigabit connection, right?

Agent: (laughs) Probably not, no. For your use case—work calls, streaming, typical household internet use—the 500 meg plan should handle that really well. You'll have plenty of headroom.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Let's do the 500. Can you set that up today?

Agent: Absolutely. Now, just to let you know, the upgrade is completely free—no installation fee. However, we will need to schedule a technician visit to upgrade your modem and equipment. That usually takes about an hour or so.

Customer: Oh, really? I thought... I mean, can't I just change it myself?

Agent: (pause) Unfortunately not, because we need to upgrade the hardware on your end. But I can get you scheduled with one of our technicians. What days typically work best for you? We have availability...

Customer: I mean, I work from home, so it's kind of tricky. Do you have any evening slots, like after 5 p.m.?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here. We do have some evening appointments available. How about this Thursday between 5 and 7 p.m.?

Customer: Thursday works. Yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. So that would be Thursday, March 16th, between 5 and 7 p.m. The technician will call you about fifteen minutes before they arrive. Is this the same number we're calling you at today?

Customer: Yes, 555-0147.

Agent: Great. So to recap, Michael, we're upgrading you from Fiber 200 to Fiber 500. Your promotional rate will be $89.99 for the first year, then it adjusts to $99.99. The upgrade is free, and we have a technician scheduled for Thursday the 16th between 5 and 7 p.m.

Customer: Perfect. And just to confirm, my speeds should be better pretty much right away after Thursday?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. Once the technician leaves, you should be good to go. You'll notice the difference immediately, especially during those peak usage times you mentioned.

Customer: Awesome. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: Hmm, just one thing. We do ask that you restart your router about 24 hours after the technician leaves, just to make sure everything is calibrated properly. But that's it.

Customer: Okay, will do. Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael. We appreciate your business with Frontier, and we're excited to get you that faster speed! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Perfect. Have a great day, and we'll see our technician at your place Thursday evening!

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
