Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you being a loyal customer with us. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service address on Maple Street in Riverside?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So I'm showing here that you're currently on our Gig Fiber 300 plan at $79.99 a month. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. But honestly, I've been working from home a lot more lately, and my wife streams a ton of Netflix, and our kid's always on gaming videos. The speeds just... they're not keeping up, you know?

Agent: Mm-hmm, I totally understand. Multiple users can definitely eat up that bandwidth. The good news is we have some fantastic options for you. What kind of speeds would you be looking for?

Customer: Well, I don't know, what do you recommend? I mean, I want something that won't lag out on me, but I don't want to break the bank either.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so for a household like yours with multiple simultaneous users, I'd typically recommend either our Gig Fiber 500 or our Gig Fiber 1 Gig plan. The 500 is really solid for streaming and remote work, and the 1 Gig is... well, it's our top tier. You'll never hit any kind of bottleneck.

Customer: What's the difference in price?

Agent: (typing sounds) So the 500 plan is $109.99 a month, and the 1 Gig plan is $149.99. Now, I should mention—are you currently locked into a contract?

Customer: I think so? I'm not totally sure. I've been on this plan for a while now.

Agent: Let me check that for you. (pause) Okay, looking at your account, you're month-to-month right now, so you're all set. No early termination fees or anything like that. And here's something I can do for you—since you're a longtime customer, I can offer you a promotional rate on either plan for the first twelve months.

Customer: Oh really? What kind of rate?

Agent: So for the Gig Fiber 500, I can get you down to $89.99 for your first year instead of the regular $109.99. And for the 1 Gig plan, I can do $119.99 for year one.

Customer: Hmm, that's actually pretty good. What happens after the first year?

Agent: After twelve months, you'll go to the regular rate. But honestly, if you stay with us at that point, we can usually work something out. Most of our customers find that's when they get better retention offers anyway.

Customer: (chuckles) Okay, that's fair. Um, I think the 500 plan sounds like it'll do what I need. When can you get that switched over?

Agent: Perfect choice. So I can go ahead and activate that for you right now, and the change will take effect on your next billing cycle, which looks like... (typing sounds) January 15th. You'll see the new speed available immediately once the change processes, though, which should be within the next 24 hours.

Customer: Wait, really? I don't need a technician to come out or anything?

Agent: Great question. Since you already have our fiber service installed and active, we can do this all provisionally from here. You shouldn't need a technician visit. The upgrade will be pushed to your equipment remotely. Now, just to set expectations, you might want to restart your modem and router once you get the notification, just to make sure everything syncs up properly.

Customer: Oh, okay. Yeah, I can do that. Um, do I need to do anything else?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. I'm going to email you a confirmation of these changes. Is the email on file still good? It looks like we have [inaudible]@gmail.com—

Customer: Yeah, no, that's not my email anymore. Can we update that?

Agent: Absolutely. What's the correct email address?

Customer: It's j-r-o-b-i-n-s-o-n at outlook dot com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've updated that. You'll get the confirmation in just a few minutes. And just so you have my name—Derek—if you run into any issues with the speed or anything doesn't look right, you can always call back and reference this call or your confirmation number, which is 4827-Bravo-Lima-9.

Customer: Great, I appreciate that. Um, one more thing—is there anything I should do with my current router? Will it still work with the faster speeds?

Agent: Good thinking. So what router model do you have?

Customer: Um, I'm not sure. It's the one you guys gave me when we set up the service.

Agent: That might be a Frontier-provided unit then. If it's pretty old, it could be a limitation on the speed you're actually getting. Since you're upgrading to 500, I'd actually recommend we send you our newer equipment—our Quantum Gateway router. It's going to maximize your speeds. I can ship that out to you at no charge, and you'd just swap it out yourself. Takes about five minutes.

Customer: That sounds good. No extra cost?

Agent: Nope, completely free. You'd just unplug the old one, plug in the new one, and you're good to go. It'll automatically configure with your network.

Customer: Awesome. Okay, I think we're good then.

Agent: Wonderful. So let me just recap what we've set up for you today. You're upgrading from Gig Fiber 300 to Gig Fiber 500. Your promotional rate for the first year is $89.99 a month, and a new router is being shipped out to you at no charge. Everything takes effect January 15th, but your speeds should be active within 24 hours. And you'll receive a confirmation email at your new address.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you so much, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. If you need anything else in the future, don't hesitate to give us a call.

Customer: Will do. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Take care!
