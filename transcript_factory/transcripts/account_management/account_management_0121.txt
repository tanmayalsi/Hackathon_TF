Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've had the same plan for like, three years now and I think it's time for something faster.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Uh, sure. It's area code 503, 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. And just to confirm, is this for the address on file at... 2847 Maple Drive in Portland?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Excellent. So, I see here you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 300 plan—that's 300 megabits per second download. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. It was great when we first got it, but honestly, my family's been home a lot more, and we're all streaming and working from home and everything. It's been getting slower, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. We definitely see a lot of customers in similar situations. Can you tell me a little bit about what you're using the internet for? That'll help me recommend the best plan for your needs.

Customer: Well, like I said, my wife and I both work from home—we're on video calls pretty much all day. Then we've got two kids who are doing online school, and they're constantly downloading stuff or watching YouTube. Plus, we like to stream movies at night, usually Netflix or Disney+.

Agent: Okay, so you've got a lot of simultaneous usage happening. That's definitely a good case for upgrading. Right now, we have a few options available in your area. We offer Frontier Fiber 500, which is 500 megabits per second, Fiber 1 Gig, which is one gigabit per second, and our newest option, Fiber 2 Gig.

Customer: Wow, okay. Um... what's the price difference? I don't want to spend a fortune here.

Agent: That's a fair question. Let me go through this with you. Your current plan is $79.99 a month. The Fiber 500 is $99.99 a month—that's a $20 increase. The Fiber 1 Gig is $129.99, and the 2 Gig is $179.99 per month.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so those are the standard prices?

Agent: These are our current regular rates, yes. However, I should mention that we have a promotional offer available right now for new service upgrades. If you go with the 1 Gig plan, I can lock you in at $99.99 per month for the first 12 months, and then it goes to the regular rate after that.

Customer: Oh, that's actually pretty good. So that would be the same as the 500 plan for the first year?

Agent: Exactly right. And honestly, given what you described about your household usage, I'd really recommend the 1 Gig. The speed upgrade will make a huge difference with multiple people working and streaming simultaneously. The 500 might help a little, but you'd probably still experience some slowdowns during peak times.

Customer: Yeah, that makes sense. And after the year is up, it goes to $129.99?

Agent: Yes, sir. The promotional rate is just for the first 12 months. After that, it moves to our standard Fiber 1 Gig rate of $129.99 per month.

Customer: Alright, I think I want to do that. The 1 Gig plan with the promotion.

Agent: Fantastic choice! (typing sounds) I'm going to get this set up for you. Just a couple quick questions—do you currently own your modem and router, or are you renting from us?

Customer: Oh, um... I think we're renting? I'm not totally sure, to be honest.

Agent: No worries, that's actually very common. Let me check here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I see that you are currently renting a modem from us. The good news is that modem is actually compatible with the 1 Gig speeds, so you won't need to swap out any equipment or pay any installation fees. You should see speed improvements pretty much immediately once the plan change goes through.

Customer: Oh great, that saves some money. How soon does this take effect?

Agent: Excellent question. The upgrade typically processes within 24 hours. You might experience a brief service interruption—usually just a couple of minutes—while the system updates. I'd recommend doing this sometime when you're not in the middle of a critical work call if possible.

Customer: (chuckles) Good point. Um, can I ask one more thing? What if I'm not happy with it or something goes wrong?

Agent: Great question. If you're not satisfied with the service upgrade, you have 30 days from the date of the upgrade to change your mind. We have a full satisfaction guarantee on all our service upgrades. You'd just need to call back in, and we can either troubleshoot any issues or get you moved back to a different plan if you'd like.

Customer: That's good to know. Okay, I think I'm ready to move forward then.

Agent: Perfect! Let me just read back the details to make sure everything is correct. You're upgrading from Frontier Fiber 300 to Frontier Fiber 1 Gig, effective tomorrow. The promotional rate of $99.99 per month will apply for 12 months, then the standard rate of $129.99 per month after that. No equipment changes or installation fees. You'll have 30 days to reconsider if needed. Does that all sound right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds great. What happens next?

Agent: You're all set! The upgrade is processed and will go live in the next 24 hours. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour. If you experience any issues or don't see the improvement in speed after 24 hours, just give us a call back and we'll troubleshoot with you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Marcus. I appreciate your help.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and thanks for upgrading with us. Enjoy those faster speeds, and have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye!
