# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer with you guys for about three years now, and I'm interested in upgrading my internet plan. Currently I'm on the 100 megabit package and it's just... it's getting a little slow, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've actually got some great options available. Let me pull up your account real quick here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. And can I verify the service address for you?

Customer: Yeah, it's 422 Maple Street, Apartment 3B, in Bozeman.

Agent: (pause) Got it, 422 Maple Street, 3B. Okay, so I'm looking at your account here and you're right, you've been with us since November of 2021. You're currently on the 100 meg plan at $59.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: Great. So what kind of activities are you doing that are making you feel like you need more speed? Just so I can recommend the best plan for you.

Customer: Well, I work from home now, and I've got video calls going on most of the day. Plus my roommate is always streaming Netflix or whatever, and when we're both online, everything just gets really laggy. I'm thinking I need something faster.

Agent: Ah, okay. Yeah, that makes total sense. Working from home plus streaming—that bandwidth adds up quick. So the good news is that we have some excellent options for you. We offer 300 megabits, 500 megabits, or our top tier of gigabit speed. That's one thousand megabits per second.

Customer: (pause) Wow, okay. What's the price difference?

Agent: Right, so let me break those down for you. The 300 meg plan is $79.99 per month. The 500 meg is $99.99, and then our gig plan is $129.99 per month. Now, as a valued customer, I can actually apply a $10 promotional discount to any of these packages for the first twelve months.

Customer: So the 300 would be...?

Agent: That would bring it down to $69.99 for the first year, then it goes to the regular price after that.

Customer: Hmm, and that's just the internet, right? No other fees or anything hidden?

Agent: Good question. The price I'm giving you includes everything—the modem rental and installation—all in. Now, we do have taxes and fees that'll be added depending on your area, but there's nothing hidden. It's all transparent. And actually, we're also running a promotion right now where if you sign up for a 24-month agreement, we waive the installation fee. That's normally $99.99.

Customer: Oh, interesting. Okay, so...

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me... let me see what we can do here. (pause) Actually, I'm looking at your location and you're in a great service area for our newer fiber infrastructure. So you could qualify for even faster speeds than what I mentioned.

Customer: Really?

Agent: Yeah, so typically in your area we can get you up to 500 megs pretty reliably. The gig service is available too, but I want to be honest with you—since you're in an apartment, sometimes the infrastructure in older buildings can be a limiting factor. But let me tell you what—if you upgrade to the 500 meg plan, we can get you set up with our newer modem, and your speeds should be super solid for your work-from-home situation and streaming.

Customer: What would that run me?

Agent: The 500 meg plan would be $99.99 per month regular price. With the $10 loyalty discount I mentioned, that's $89.99 for the first year. And if you do the 24-month agreement, I can waive that $99.99 installation fee.

Customer: That seems pretty reasonable actually. Will I have any downtime when you do the installation?

Agent: Great question. Yeah, so we typically need a technician to come out and do the install, and that usually takes about an hour to an hour and a half. During that time, your service will be down while they're setting everything up. But honestly, for your situation with the video calls and everything, it'll be worth that one time inconvenience.

Customer: Yeah, I could probably schedule that for a weekend. When's the earliest you could get someone out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) Okay, so we've got openings this coming Saturday between 10 AM and 2 PM, or we have Monday and Tuesday of next week in the morning slot, 8 AM to 12 PM. What works best for you?

Customer: Saturday would be perfect, actually. This Saturday?

Agent: (pause) Yes, this Saturday we have availability. Let me just confirm—is Saturday, November 16th good for you between 10 AM and 2 PM?

Customer: Yeah, absolutely.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so let me just recap everything for you to make sure we're on the same page. We're upgrading you from the 100 meg plan to the 500 meg plan. That's $89.99 per month for the first twelve months with your loyalty discount, regular price after that is $99.99. We're waiving the installation fee with the 24-month agreement. Installation is scheduled for Saturday, November 16th, between 10 AM and 2 PM, and one of our technicians will come out and set up your new equipment. Does all that sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds great. Um, one more quick question—am I keeping the same bill due date?

Agent: That's a good question. Your current bill cycles on the 22nd of each month, and that'll stay the same. Your first bill at the new rate will be pro-rated if the installation happens before the 22nd, so you'll see the difference reflected there. But then from December onwards, it'll be the regular $89.99.

Customer: Okay perfect. Thank you so much, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! And hey, I think you're gonna be really happy with this upgrade. 500 megs should handle your work calls and streaming no problem. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, fantastic. We'll see you this Saturday. Just keep an eye on your email—we're gonna send you a confirmation of that appointment, along with some information about our technician and what to expect. If you have any questions before then, just give us a call back. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks Derek, I appreciate it!

Agent: You have a great day!
