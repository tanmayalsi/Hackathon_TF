Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan and I'm thinking about upgrading to something faster. My internet's been pretty good, but we've got more people working from home now and streaming is getting a little choppy.

Agent: Okay, I can definitely help you with that. Let me just pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I've got you here. So you're currently on our 500 Mbps Fiber plan. That's a great service. And you're located in... looks like the Scottsdale area?

Customer: Yep, that's right.

Agent: Awesome. So what you're experiencing with the buffering and slowdowns... are you noticing that mostly during certain times of day, or is it pretty consistent?

Customer: It's really during peak hours, you know? Like in the evenings, maybe around 6 or 7 PM when everyone's home. My daughter's doing online school, my wife's usually on some kind of call for work, and then I'm trying to download files. It just gets overwhelmed, I guess.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. With multiple devices running simultaneously, you're definitely hitting the limits of what 500 meg can handle. We actually have a couple of options for you. We offer a 1 gig plan, which is 1000 megabits per second, and that's still fiber, so you'd get that dedicated bandwidth. We also have a 2 gig option if you really want to future-proof things.

Customer: Okay, so... what's the price difference? I'm currently paying, I think it's around $79 a month?

Agent: (pause) Let me just verify that here... (typing sounds) Yes, you're on the $79.99 plan. So for our 1 gigabit service, that's currently $119.99 per month, and the 2 gig is at $199.99. However, I should mention we do have a promotional rate running through the end of the month. I can get you the 1 gig plan for $99.99 for the first year.

Customer: Oh, really? So it jumps to $119.99 after that?

Agent: Correct. After your first year, it would go to the regular rate of $119.99. But you could always call back closer to that time if you'd like to discuss it further. A lot of customers find that the 1 gig is really the sweet spot for households like yours.

Customer: That seems reasonable. What would be the installation process? Would I need to get a new router or anything?

Agent: Great question. So since you're already on our fiber network, the installation is actually pretty straightforward. Our technician would come out, and it's typically about a one to two hour window. They'll upgrade the equipment at the ONT—that's the terminal box—and replace your modem to one that's compatible with the gigabit speeds. The new router we provide can definitely handle it. There's no cost for the installation or the equipment.

Customer: Nice. And how soon could someone come out? We'd ideally like to get this done before the kids' school year starts up again.

Agent: (typing sounds) So school starts when, roughly?

Customer: About three weeks from now.

Agent: Perfect. We've got availability in your area. Let me see what we have... (pause) How does next Tuesday morning look? We have a window between 8 AM and 10 AM available.

Customer: That would be perfect, actually.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to get that scheduled for you. That's Tuesday, August 19th, between 8 and 10 AM. And just to confirm, the service address is the same as the phone number location?

Customer: Yeah, same address.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. So to summarize the changes here—you're upgrading from 500 meg to 1 gig fiber at $99.99 for your first year, then $119.99 after that. Your promotional rate requires a 12-month commitment. Is that all clear?

Customer: Yep, sounds good. One more thing though—will this affect my email or anything like that? I've got my Frontier email set up.

Agent: No, your email will stay exactly the same. This is just a service speed upgrade. Your email account doesn't change at all. You'll get faster speeds, but everything else remains the same. (pause) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. When will I get the confirmation or anything?

Agent: So I'm sending a confirmation email to the email address on file right now. You should receive that within the next few minutes. You'll also get a courtesy call from our scheduling team about 24 hours before the appointment, just to confirm the technician's coming.

Customer: Okay, great. Thanks so much for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! We really appreciate your business, and I'm confident you're going to love those gigabit speeds. Your family's going to have a much smoother experience. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: Nope, that's everything!

Agent: Perfect. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we'll see you Tuesday morning!

Customer: Thank you. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
