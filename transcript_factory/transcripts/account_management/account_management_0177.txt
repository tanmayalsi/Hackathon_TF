# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently a Frontier customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. I've had the 100 meg plan for a couple years now and it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're on our Gigabit 100 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Great. And can I ask what's prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, streaming...?

Customer: Both, honestly. My wife and I are both working from home now, and we've got kids doing school online too. Plus we're constantly streaming, Netflix, all that stuff. And our internet just keeps bogging down. Pages take forever to load sometimes, and don't even get me started on video calls.

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally hear you. That's actually really common with multiple users on the same connection. The good news is we have some great options available in your area. (typing sounds) So we can actually upgrade you to our Gigabit 500 plan, or if you really want to maximize your speeds, we have our Gig plan at gigabit speeds—that's up to 1,000 megabits per second.

Customer: Wow, okay. So what's the difference between those two?

Agent: So the 500 plan is gonna give you 500 megs down and 20 megs up, and then the Gig plan maxes out at 1 gig—that's 1,000 megs down and 50 megs up. For what you described with multiple people working from home and streaming, honestly, the Gig plan would probably be ideal. It's designed to handle heavy usage like that.

Customer: How much more is that gonna cost me?

Agent: Let me see here... (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so you're currently paying $79.99 a month for the Gigabit 100 plan, right?

Customer: Yeah, sounds about right.

Agent: So the 500 plan would be $109.99 a month, and the Gig plan is $149.99 a month. But—and this is the good part—we've actually got a promotion running right now for existing customers upgrading. I can get you the Gig plan for $119.99 a month for the first year. After that it goes to the regular price, but you'd save $30 a month for the first twelve months.

Customer: Oh, okay, that's not too bad actually. How long would the installation take?

Agent: (typing sounds) So looking at your service address, our next available appointment window is this Saturday between 8 and 10 AM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Saturday morning... yeah, that should work. I'll make sure someone's home.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, the installation is completely free with the upgrade. Our technician will come out, upgrade your modem and router to equipment compatible with the faster speeds, run any necessary line checks, and make sure everything's running smoothly before they leave.

Customer: Great. Um, is there anything else I need to do beforehand? Do I need to do anything to my current setup?

Agent: Nope, nothing on your end. Just make sure you have access to your home when the technician arrives. They'll handle everything. (pause) Oh, and I'll be scheduling this on your account right now. You'll get a confirmation email within the next hour, and then you'll get an automated reminder text on Friday just to confirm the appointment.

Customer: Sounds good.

Agent: (typing sounds) And one more thing—I want to make sure you're aware that this promotion is locked in for 12 months, but after that the rate will adjust to our standard pricing of $149.99. You'll get a notice 30 days before the promotion expires, just so there are no surprises.

Customer: Got it. And if I wanted to cancel before that, is there anything...?

Agent: Good question. There's no early termination fee with this upgrade since we're not extending your contract. So if you decide it's not for you, you can cancel anytime. But I have a feeling you're gonna love the speeds. (laughs) People really notice the difference.

Customer: (laughs) Well hopefully it fixes the work-from-home situation. My boss was asking why I kept freezing on video calls.

Agent: Yeah, that should definitely solve that. Okay, so to recap everything: you're upgrading to our Gigabit plan at $119.99 a month for the first year, installation is Saturday between 8 and 10 AM, it's completely free, and our technician will take care of everything. Does all of that sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: I think we're all set. Oh, just one thing—our technician might call you about 30 minutes before they arrive on Saturday, just to confirm they're on their way. So keep an eye on your phone.

Customer: Okay, will do.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being a loyal customer. If you have any other questions before Saturday, feel free to give us a call back or check your email for the confirmation. We really appreciate your business.

Customer: Great, thanks Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye.
