# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've been with you guys for like, three years now and my speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! I appreciate your loyalty. Before we dive in, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Got it. I'm showing an account for Sarah Chen at 412 Maple Street in Portland. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your speeds aren't meeting your needs. What speeds are you currently on with us?

Customer: I think it's... 300 meg? Maybe? Honestly, I'm not totally sure. But I work from home now, and my husband streams a lot of stuff in the evenings, and we've got like three kids doing homework online. It's just been really slow lately.

Agent: I totally understand. That's definitely a common issue when you have multiple people using the connection. (pause) Okay, I'm actually seeing here that you're on our Fiber 300 plan. And you know what? Given what you just described, I'd actually recommend looking at our Fiber 500 or even our Fiber Gig plan. The Gig would give you one gigabit speeds, which would handle all of that pretty easily.

Customer: Wait, really? How much more is that? I'm not trying to break the bank here.

Agent: That's a great question. So your current plan is $69.99 a month. If you upgrade to the Fiber 500, it would be $89.99 a month, which is a $20 increase. Or the Fiber Gig is $129.99 a month. (pause) But here's the thing—because you've been a customer for three years and you're in good standing, I can actually offer you a promotional rate on either of those.

Customer: Oh really? Like how much of a discount?

Agent: For the Fiber 500, I can lock you in at $79.99 a month for the first 12 months, so you'd only be paying an extra ten dollars a month. And for the Gig plan, I could do $119.99 for the first year. After that, it would go to the regular rate, but you'd have that first year at that promotional price.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, that's actually not too bad. What's the difference between the 500 and the Gig again?

Agent: So the 500 gives you 500 megabits per second download speeds, and the Gig gives you up to one gigabit, which is 1,000 megabits per second. For what you described—working from home, streaming, multiple devices—honestly, either one would be a huge upgrade from where you are now. The Gig is more future-proof if you think you'll need it down the road, but the 500 would handle your current situation really well.

Customer: How long does it take to install the new stuff?

Agent: Good question. I can definitely check availability for you. (typing sounds) So since you already have our fiber infrastructure at your location, we wouldn't need to do any digging or construction. I can schedule a technician visit to upgrade your equipment, which typically takes about an hour. We have availability... let me see... we have some slots next Tuesday or Thursday afternoon. Or I can get you in the following Monday morning if that's better for you.

Customer: Next Tuesday works. What time?

Agent: I'm showing we have a 2 to 4 PM window available next Tuesday. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. Will there be any downtime or anything? Like, I'm working from home that day...

Agent: That's something I should mention. During the installation, your internet will be down for probably 15 to 20 minutes while we make the switch. I'd recommend just letting your employer know you might have a brief outage that afternoon. Most people try to schedule it for a time when they're not in critical meetings or anything.

Customer: Okay, I'll make note of that. And just to confirm—I'm not going to have any equipment fees or anything, right?

Agent: (pause) Let me just double-check that for you. (typing sounds) No, you're all set. The equipment swap is included with your upgrade, and there's no installation fee since you're an existing customer. You'll just see the new rate on your next bill.

Customer: That sounds good. Oh, and one more thing—do I need to do anything with my old router or modem?

Agent: The technician will actually take care of all that. They'll remove your old equipment and swap in the new modem and router, which is compatible with our upgraded speeds. They'll test everything to make sure it's working properly before they leave. So you don't have to do anything—we've got you covered.

Customer: Perfect. Alright, so I'm going with the 500 plan at the promotional price?

Agent: That's what I have here. So to recap: you're upgrading from Fiber 300 to Fiber 500, your rate for the first 12 months will be $79.99 a month instead of the regular $89.99, and we have you scheduled for a technician visit next Tuesday, 2 to 4 PM. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.

Agent: Excellent! I'm going to send a confirmation email to the address we have on file. You should receive that within the next few minutes. It'll have your confirmation number, the technician's information, and all the details about your new plan. Is the email address we have current?

Customer: Uh, [inaudible] I think it might be outdated, actually. It's sarah.chen.412 at gmail dot com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. Let me update that for you. (pause) Okay, I've got that changed. You should get that confirmation shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks so much for your help, Marcus. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah! Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being such a great long-term customer. You're going to love those faster speeds. If you have any questions before Tuesday, just don't hesitate to give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Thanks again, bye!

Agent: Bye now!
