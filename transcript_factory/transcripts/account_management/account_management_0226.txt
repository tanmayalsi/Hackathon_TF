Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So I'm currently on like... I think it's the 100 meg plan? And I'm looking to upgrade because my internet's been pretty slow lately, especially when my kids are doing their online school stuff.

Agent: I totally understand. We've had a lot of customers mentioning that, especially with everyone working and learning from home these days. I'd be happy to help you find a better plan. Can I grab your account number or phone number on file to pull up your information?

Customer: Uh, yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And can I get the last four digits of the Social Security number associated with the account?

Customer: Oh, it's... 3829.

Agent: (pause) Great, thank you. Okay, so I'm seeing here that you've been with us for about three years on our 100 Mbps service. Your address is still 447 Maple Street, right?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So what kind of speeds are you looking at? Are you interested in going up to our 300 Meg, or would you like to explore some of our higher-tier options? We actually just launched our new 1 gig fiber service in your area.

Customer: Oh wow, 1 gig? That sounds... I mean, isn't that overkill? What's the price difference?

Agent: (chuckles) It can sound like a lot, but honestly, it's become pretty popular. Your household has how many people working or learning from home?

Customer: Three, usually. My wife works remotely, and then we've got two kids who are in virtual school most days.

Agent: Okay, so you've got basically three concurrent connections that might need bandwidth. You know, with the 300 Meg plan, that would definitely be an improvement over your current 100 Meg. You're looking at about... (typing sounds) ...an additional $25 a month for that one. The 1 gig service would be $79.99 a month, so that's $45 more than what you're paying now.

Customer: Hmm. And what's the difference? Like, would I actually notice a difference between 300 and 1 gig?

Agent: That's a great question. For most households, 300 meg is honestly sufficient for streaming, video calls, online gaming—all that stuff. The 1 gig is really more if you're doing heavy uploads, multiple 4K streams at the same time, or if you want that... you know, future-proofing your home for the next five or ten years.

Customer: Right, okay. I think 300 might be good enough for now. How long would it take to upgrade?

Agent: So the good news is, since you're already a fiber customer at that address, we can typically get you upgraded within two to three business days. We wouldn't need a technician visit. It's just a configuration change on our end. Can we schedule that for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works. Um, do I need to do anything on my end? Like, will my modem need to change?

Agent: That's another good question. Let me check which modem you currently have. (typing sounds) Okay, so you've got the Frontier-issued model... looks like it's the one from about two years ago. That modem will actually work fine with the 300 Meg service, so no changes needed there.

Customer: Oh great, so I just... wait, nothing happens on my end?

Agent: Correct. You literally don't have to do anything. The upgrade happens automatically on our network side. You might see a slight speed improvement within the next couple hours after the upgrade goes live, but everything stays the same on your equipment.

Customer: That's perfect. So when can we do this?

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, so looking at our schedule, we can actually activate this as early as tomorrow after 6 PM if that works for you? Or if you prefer, we can do it for Thursday morning?

Customer: Tomorrow works. That's... that's great.

Agent: Excellent. So just to confirm, I'm upgrading your service from 100 Mbps to 300 Mbps, effective tomorrow after 6 PM. Your new monthly rate will be $89.99 instead of your current $64.99, so that's $25 more per month. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. And this is... there's no contract or anything, right?

Agent: No contract at all. You're month-to-month, just like you have been. If for some reason you're not happy with the service after thirty days, you can always downgrade back. Though I have to say, most customers love the speed boost once they experience it.

Customer: (laughs) Okay, okay, I'm sold. What else do I need to know?

Agent: I think we're all set! I'm going to send you a confirmation email to the address we have on file. It'll have all the details about the upgrade, including the effective date and your new billing amount. You should receive that within the next five minutes or so.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything I should watch out for? Like, will my internet go down during the switch?

Agent: That's a really good question. You might experience a very brief interruption—we're talking like, maybe thirty seconds to a minute—but that would be it. Most customers don't even notice it, honestly.

Customer: Great. I think that's everything then.

Agent: Awesome. Well, I really appreciate you choosing to upgrade with Frontier, and I hope the faster speeds make a big difference for you and your family. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! Have a great day, and thanks again for being a Frontier customer.

Customer: You too, take care.

Agent: Bye now.
