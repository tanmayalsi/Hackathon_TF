Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on like... I think it's the 100 meg plan? And honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore. I've been working from home a lot more, and my partner streams during the day, and our kid's doing virtual tutoring sessions. It's just getting too slow.

Agent: Oh, I completely understand. That's actually one of the most common reasons we get upgrade requests. Working from home really does change your bandwidth needs. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're right, you're on our Fiber 100 plan. That's been active for... looks like about eighteen months. And I can see you've got a clean payment history, so that's great. (pause) So what kind of speeds were you thinking about upgrading to? We've got several options available in your area.

Customer: Um, well, what do you recommend? Like, what would actually handle all that stuff I mentioned without issues?

Agent: Great question. So with multiple people using the internet simultaneously, especially with streaming and video calls, I'd recommend at least our Fiber 300 plan. That's 300 megabits per second, and it's really our sweet spot for households like yours. We also have Fiber 500 if you want some extra headroom, or our top tier, Fiber Gig, which is a full gigabit per second.

Customer: Okay, so what's the price difference? I'm on... I don't even remember what I'm paying right now. (laughs)

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, that happens. So let me check your current bill. Looks like you're at $79.99 per month. The Fiber 300 would be $99.99, so that's about twenty bucks more. The Fiber 500 is $129.99, and the Fiber Gig is $159.99.

Customer: Hmm. So twenty bucks... that's not too bad actually. But do I need to get new equipment or anything? Last time I upgraded something with another company, they tried to charge me a ton.

Agent: That's a fair concern. (pause) So the good news is, with the Fiber 300, your current modem and router should actually work fine—we just need to provision the line for the higher speed on our end. That's completely free. However, if you want optimal performance, especially with multiple devices, we do have our newer mesh router system available. That's $14.99 per month, or you can purchase it outright for $199.

Customer: A mesh system? What's that exactly?

Agent: So basically, instead of a single router, it's multiple units that work together to give you better coverage throughout your whole home. A lot of our customers find it really helps, especially in larger homes, or if your router is far from where you're working or where people are streaming. But it's optional.

Customer: You know what, I think our current setup is okay. The connection's just slow, not spotty, you know?

Agent: Makes sense. So we could definitely try the upgrade without the router first, and if you find you want better coverage down the line, it's easy to add on. Let me just make sure I have everything here. (typing sounds) So we're looking at upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300. That brings you to $99.99 per month, and we can schedule an installation window. How soon were you looking to get this done?

Customer: Like... as soon as possible? Ideally this week?

Agent: (pause) Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) Okay, so we've got some openings this Thursday between 2 and 6 PM, or Friday morning between 8 and noon. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Thursday afternoon would be perfect. Around 3 or 4?

Agent: Great. I'm going to put you down for Thursday, 2 to 6 PM window, and a technician will text you on the morning of to confirm a more specific time. The service should be up and running that same day. One more thing—just so you know, there's no installation fee for this upgrade since you're already a fiber customer. That would normally be $99.

Customer: Oh, that's good. Okay, so we're good then?

Agent: Almost. Let me just confirm all the details. You're upgrading to Fiber 300, that's $99.99 per month, installation Thursday between 2 and 6 PM, no setup fee, and your existing equipment will work fine. Is that all correct?

Customer: Yep, that sounds good to me.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to send you a confirmation email at the address we have on file, which is... (pause) looks like [email address]. Does that still look good?

Customer: Actually, can you update that? I changed it to [inaudible]@gmail.com a while back but never updated it with you guys.

Agent: Oh sure, no problem. What's the new email?

Customer: It's S-T-E-V-E-N... all one word... steven.martinez82@gmail.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. Steven.martinez82@gmail.com. And I'll make sure the confirmation goes there. You'll also receive a text reminder Thursday morning with the tech's ETA, and they can reach you at the number on file, right? That's the 555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's my cell, so that's perfect.

Agent: Excellent. Well, I think we're all set here. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for walking me through all that, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. You're going to love that extra speed. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too!

Agent: Bye now!
