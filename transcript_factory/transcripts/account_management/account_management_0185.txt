# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, I'm currently on the 300 meg plan, and I'm thinking about upgrading to something faster. My roommate's been streaming a lot, and I've noticed things have been getting pretty slow lately.

Agent: I totally understand. We've been seeing a lot of that, especially with multiple users at home these days. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your phone number or account number?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

(typing sounds)

Agent: Perfect, I'm looking at your account now. So you're on our 300 megabit plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Been with you guys for about, I don't know, two years maybe?

Agent: Great, and I can see that's been a solid plan. Now, for the upgrade, we've got a couple of options that might work really well for you. We have our 500 megabit plan, which is great if you've got multiple devices going at once, and then we also have our gigabit plan—that's one gig up and down—which is honestly becoming really popular right now.

Customer: Oh wow, gigabit? That's... that sounds really fast. What's the price difference on that?

Agent: (pause) Okay, so your current plan is $79.99 a month, and the 500 meg is $99.99, so that's a twenty-dollar increase. The gigabit plan is $129.99 a month.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) That's a bit of a jump. What... I mean, is that promotional pricing or is that the regular rate?

Agent: That's regular pricing, but actually, I'm looking at some promotions we have running right now. For new upgrades like yours, I can knock off... let me see here... yeah, I can do $99.99 for the gigabit plan for the first three months, and then it goes to the regular rate after that. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh, that's better! But wait, after three months it jumps to $129.99?

Agent: Yes, so you'd have three months at the promotional rate of $99.99, and then it would move to $129.99 per month.

Customer: Yeah, okay, that's actually pretty reasonable. I mean, honestly, with the streaming and everything, the extra speed would probably be worth it. How fast is the gigabit compared to what I have now?

Agent: So you'd be going from 300 megabits to 1,000 megabits, so that's more than three times faster. It's definitely a noticeable difference, especially when you've got multiple people using the connection.

Customer: Right, right. And that's the same modem and router setup, or would I need different equipment?

Agent: That's a good question. For gigabit speeds, we'd actually need to get you upgraded equipment. The modem and router combo we'd send you is compatible with our gigabit service, so it'll support those speeds. There's no additional equipment fee either—that's included.

Customer: Oh, that's good. When would that ship out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so if we process this today, we can get the equipment out to you within 3 to 5 business days, and then you'd be able to activate it yourself once it arrives. You'll get an email with instructions and everything. Or, if you prefer, you can schedule a technician to come out and set it up for you at no charge.

Customer: No, I think I can handle it myself. I've done that kind of thing before. So... yeah, let's do it. Let's go ahead and upgrade.

Agent: Awesome! I'm really excited for you. This is going to make a huge difference. Let me just confirm all the details here. You're upgrading from the 300 meg plan to our gigabit plan at the promotional rate of $99.99 for three months, then $129.99 after that. Your service address is still 4521 Maple Street, Apartment 3B, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And the change will be effective as of tomorrow at 12:01 AM, so your billing cycle will reflect that. You should see the equipment arrive by... (typing sounds) ...by next Friday at the latest. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! And just so you know, if you have any issues with the activation or setup when the equipment arrives, you can always give us a call back or you can check our website for the self-help guide. We're here 24/7 if you need us.

Customer: Great, I appreciate that.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier Communications, and we really do appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Thanks again. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
