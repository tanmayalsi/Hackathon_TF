Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Marcus. So, I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm pretty happy with your service, but I'm thinking I need to upgrade. My internet's just not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I appreciate that, and I'm glad you've had a good experience with us. I'd be happy to help you find a plan that better fits your needs. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... um, let me find it. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm pulling that up now. So while I do that, can you tell me a little bit about what you're looking for? Are you working from home, streaming a lot, or...?

Customer: Yeah, actually, that's the main thing. My wife and I both work from home now—we've been doing that for about a year—and we're constantly on video calls. Plus, our kid's doing online school, so we've got like three different devices going at once. Our current speed just isn't handling it well. We're getting drops and everything feels slow.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I totally understand. That's actually really common, especially with multiple people on the network. What speed are you currently on with us?

Customer: I think it's the 100 meg plan? Maybe? I'm not entirely sure, to be honest.

Agent: No problem, I'm looking at it right now. Yes, you're on our Fiber 100 plan at $59.99 a month. And you've had that for about two years, correct?

Customer: Yeah, sounds about right.

Agent: Great. So for your situation with multiple video calls, remote work, and online schooling, I'd definitely recommend looking at an upgrade. We have a few options. Our Fiber 200 plan would double your speed, and then we also have Fiber 500 and Fiber Gig, which is our gigabit speed.

Customer: Wow, okay. What's the pricing on those?

Agent: So Fiber 200 is $79.99 a month. Fiber 500 is $99.99, and our Fiber Gig is $129.99. However, (typing sounds) I'm actually seeing some promotional pricing available for you right now. If you upgrade to the Fiber 500 plan, I can get you set up at $89.99 for the first year, then it goes to the regular price.

Customer: Oh, nice. And what's the difference between 500 and gig?

Agent: Great question. So 500 megabits per second should be more than enough for what you're describing—multiple video calls, streaming, online school, all happening simultaneously. The gigabit plan at 1000 megabits is really for power users, like if you were running a business server or doing heavy video production or gaming at a professional level. For home use with what you mentioned, 500 should handle it beautifully without any issues.

Customer: Yeah, that makes sense. And there's no installation fee or anything like that?

Agent: Let me check. (pause, typing sounds) Since you're already an existing customer with Fiber service, we won't need to run new lines. It would just be a modem upgrade, and we can actually mail that to you, or you can pick it up at a local Frontier store if you prefer. There's no installation charge for existing fiber customers upgrading their speed.

Customer: Oh, that's perfect. I was worried about that. And when could that happen?

Agent: We can get you switched over as soon as tomorrow, actually. Once we finalize this upgrade, the modem will ship out, and you should have it within three to five business days. You'll get a tracking number sent to your email. And when it arrives, it's just a quick plug-and-play setup—takes maybe five minutes, tops.

Customer: That's awesome. Um, one more thing—do I need to sign a contract or anything?

Agent: Good question. Since you're upgrading your existing service, there's no long-term contract required. It's month-to-month, so you have the flexibility if your needs change down the road.

Customer: Okay, that works for me. I think I want to do the 500 plan with that promotional pricing.

Agent: Excellent choice. Let me just make sure I have everything correct. So I'm going to upgrade you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500, effective immediately. Your new rate is $89.99 per month for the first year, then $99.99 after that. We'll ship out the new modem, and you'll receive a tracking email. Your account phone number will remain 555-0147, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's all correct.

Agent: Perfect. And I'm going to send a confirmation email to the address on file, which is [inaudible]... Actually, is that still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Um, it's actually [inaudible]@outlook.com now. Can you update that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely, I'm updating that right now. You'll get the confirmation and the modem tracking info at that new email address. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks so much, Marcus. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and I'm confident this upgrade is going to make a huge difference for you and your family with the work-from-home situation. If you have any issues once the modem arrives, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again!

Agent: Have a great day!
