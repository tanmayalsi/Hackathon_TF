Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've had your service for about three years now and I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing here you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. That's our hundred megabit per second tier. What's prompting the upgrade today? Are you working from home, or...?

Customer: Yeah, actually. I started working from home full-time about six months ago, and my upload speeds have been pretty frustrating. I'm doing a lot of video conferencing and file transfers, and it just feels slow sometimes. Plus, my roommate and I stream a lot in the evenings, so I think we need more bandwidth.

Agent: That makes total sense. Video conferencing and streaming can definitely benefit from higher speeds. So with your current plan, you're getting around 100 down and about 10 up. Is that about right? Do you remember what your uploads are?

Customer: Um, I think it's around 10, yeah. Maybe a little less sometimes? I haven't really checked in a while.

Agent: No problem. Well, the good news is we have a couple of options that would be perfect for your situation. We've got our Fiber 300 plan, which gives you 300 down and 15 up. And then we also have our Fiber Gig plan, which is a full gigabit—that's 1,000 down and 35 up.

Customer: Okay... (pause) What's the price difference? I don't want to go crazy with the cost, but I also want something that's actually going to make a difference.

Agent: Let me see what we can do for you. (typing sounds) For the Fiber 300, I'm showing that at $69.99 a month with our promotional rate. That's locked in for the first twelve months.

Customer: Okay, and what about the gigabit?

Agent: The Fiber Gig is $99.99 a month for the first year, then it goes to our standard rate after that. Though honestly, with the work-from-home situation and streaming, that upload speed on the Gig plan would be a game-changer for you. Those 35 upload megabits will make video conferencing really smooth, and file transfers will be noticeably faster.

Customer: How much faster are we talking?

Agent: Well, think about it this way. If you're uploading a large file right now on your 10 up connection, it's going to take significantly longer than if you had 35 up. The difference is pretty dramatic. Say you're uploading a 500-megabyte presentation file. At 10 up, that's going to take several minutes. At 35 up, you're looking at less than two minutes.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, that does sound pretty good. Can I ask—is there any difference in the equipment? Like, do I need a new modem or anything?

Agent: Great question. Your current modem is fine for the Fiber 300, but for the Fiber Gig plan, we'd recommend upgrading to one of our newer modems. We can actually ship that to you for free, and it's just a simple swap. Takes about five minutes to hook up.

Customer: Would there be any installation fees or anything?

Agent: (typing sounds) So here's the thing—since you're already a customer upgrading your service, we can waive the installation fee. It would normally be $99, but we'll take care of that for you. The equipment ships free, and you'd just swap it out yourself. Easy peasy.

Customer: Oh, that's great. (pause) Okay, I'm leaning toward the gigabit plan. That seems like it'll be more future-proof, you know?

Agent: I think that's a smart call, honestly. You'll see a huge difference, especially with everything you've got going on. Let me just go over the details with you here. (typing sounds) I'm setting you up for the Fiber Gig plan at $99.99 a month for the first year. After that, it'll be $119.99 a month. We'll waive the installation fee, and we'll ship the new modem out to you at no charge. You should have it within five to seven business days, and your service upgrade can be activated as soon as you have the modem installed.

Customer: That sounds perfect. Do I need to do anything on my end, or does it just... activate automatically?

Agent: (pause) So what'll happen is the modem will come with instructions, and it'll actually guide you through the setup process. Once you plug it in and follow the steps on the screen, your service will automatically upgrade. But here's my suggestion—schedule it for a time when you don't need your internet, just in case there's any hiccup. Usually takes about five minutes, but better safe than sorry with work-from-home situations.

Customer: Absolutely, yeah. That makes sense.

Agent: Perfect. Just to confirm everything—we're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber Gig. Your new rate is $99.99 a month. Installation fee is waived. New modem ships free within five to seven business days. Does all of that sound correct?

Customer: Yes, that's perfect. When does all this take effect?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so the modem will ship out today. Your service upgrade will be scheduled for seven days from now, which gives you time to receive the equipment and get it set up. But if it arrives sooner and you want to activate early, just give us a call and we can bump that up for you.

Customer: Great. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: Just one thing—we've got a quick survey at the end of this call. Would you be willing to take just a minute or two to give us some feedback on your experience today?

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: Awesome, I really appreciate that. Your account is all set, and we're really excited to get you up to that gigabit speed. You're going to notice the difference immediately. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much, Derek.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and thank you for your loyalty as a customer. Before we go, let me just transfer you to our quick survey. This'll just take a minute or two.

Customer: Okay, sounds good.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks again, and enjoy your new speeds!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
