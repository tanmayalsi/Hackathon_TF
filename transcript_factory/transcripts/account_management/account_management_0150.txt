Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on the, uh, the 100 megabit plan, and honestly it's just not cutting it anymore. I've got two kids doing remote learning, my wife's working from home, and we're constantly buffering when we try to stream anything. It's becoming a real problem.

Agent: I totally understand. That sounds frustrating, especially with multiple people online at once. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan at, let me see... $59.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Great. And just out of curiosity, have you been with us long?

Customer: Uh, probably about three years now? Maybe a little longer. Yeah, been pretty happy with the service overall, just need more speed at this point.

Agent: Well, I appreciate your loyalty, and I'm glad we've been able to serve you. So for your situation, I'd definitely recommend looking at our Fiber 300 plan. It's three times the speed you're getting now, and it's really ideal for households with multiple users streaming and working simultaneously.

Customer: Okay, what's the price on that?

Agent: So the Fiber 300 is $79.99 per month for the first twelve months. After that, it goes to $89.99. But I should mention, since you've been such a loyal customer, I can actually add a promotional discount that brings it down to $69.99 for the first year.

Customer: (pause) That's not too bad. What's the difference between that and the Fiber 500? I want to make sure I'm not undershooting this.

Agent: Good question. The Fiber 500 gives you... (typing sounds) ...500 megabits per second compared to 300. For most households, honestly, the 300 is plenty unless you're doing something like 4K streaming on multiple devices simultaneously or heavy gaming. But if you've got that capacity, it's $99.99 a month, and I could get you the same promotional rate there too, so $89.99 for the first year.

Customer: Hmm. I mean, my son does play online games pretty seriously. Like, he's on his computer a lot. Would that 500 be better for him?

Agent: It definitely wouldn't hurt. Lower latency is great for gaming, and having that extra bandwidth means the rest of your household activities won't slow him down. You know, downloads and uploads will be faster too if he's ever transferring files or streaming his gameplay.

Customer: (pause) ...Yeah, okay. Let's do the 500. Better safe than sorry, right?

Agent: Absolutely. I think that's a smart choice. (typing sounds) So I'm going to set you up for the Fiber 500 plan at the promotional rate of $89.99 per month for the first twelve months. And then after that, it'll be the regular rate of $99.99.

Customer: Okay, cool. When can that be activated?

Agent: Great question. So the upgrade itself can be processed today, and since you're already a fiber customer at your address, you won't need a technician to come out. It should be live by tonight, actually. Typically within the next couple of hours once I submit this order.

Customer: Oh wow, that's faster than I expected. That's great.

Agent: (chuckling) Yeah, one of the perks of having fiber already installed. So let me just confirm the details here. You're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500, the promotional rate of $89.99 for the first year, regular rate thereafter. The service address is still 4521 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And you'll receive a confirmation email within the next fifteen minutes or so. You should see the speed increase once you restart your modem and router tonight. I'd recommend doing that after, say, 9 PM just to be safe.

Customer: Will I need a new modem or anything?

Agent: Let me check... (typing sounds) No, your current modem is compatible with the 500 plan, so you're all set there. You might see a firmware update happen automatically, but that's normal and nothing to worry about.

Customer: Excellent. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Just to recap—you'll get that confirmation email, restart your modem and router later tonight, and you should be good to go. If you notice anything unusual or the speed doesn't increase, just give us a call back and we can troubleshoot, but I'm confident everything will go smoothly.

Customer: Sounds good, Marcus. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your continued business. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
