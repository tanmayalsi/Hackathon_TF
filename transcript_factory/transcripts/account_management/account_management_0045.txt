Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I currently have the 100 meg plan, and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. Internet needs definitely change over time. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're on our Gigabit 100 plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've had it for about two years now, and honestly, my kids are doing remote learning, my wife works from home, and we're streaming in like three different rooms. It's just become a bottleneck.

Agent: Oh yeah, that makes total sense. Multiple video streams and work-from-home setups definitely push those speeds. (pause) So what kind of speeds were you thinking about upgrading to? We have our Gigabit 300, our Gigabit 500, and then our top tier is Gigabit 940.

Customer: Hmm, what's the price difference? I don't want to go crazy, but I need something that's actually going to handle everything without slowing down.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so you're currently at $59.99 a month for your 100 meg service. If you upgrade to our Gigabit 300, that's $79.99 a month. The 500 is $99.99, and the 940 is our premium tier at $129.99.

Customer: Wow, okay. And these are introductory rates or...?

Agent: Great question. So the $79.99 and $99.99 are locked in for twelve months. After that, it would adjust to our standard rate, but you'd have the option to keep the plan or revisit it at that time. The 940 is $129.99 for the first year, then $149.99 after that.

Customer: Right, right. (pause) I think the 500 sounds pretty good. That should be enough for what we need, and the price isn't too bad.

Agent: Excellent choice. The Gigabit 500 is a really popular plan, and honestly, for your situation with multiple users, you're going to see a huge difference. You'll go from 100 megs to 500 megs download speed, so that's five times faster.

Customer: Perfect. How quick can you get that set up?

Agent: Well, the good news is you're already in our service area and we have your existing line. (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... We can actually upgrade you as soon as tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM if that works?

Customer: Tomorrow? Really? That's great.

Agent: Yeah, and since you're already a customer, there's no installation fee. We'll just swap out your modem and make sure everything's configured properly. The technician will be there... (pause) ...probably takes about thirty minutes to an hour.

Customer: Okay, that works. Morning is fine for us.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) So just to confirm everything—I'm scheduling the upgrade to Gigabit 500 for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. Your new rate is $79.99 a month for the first twelve months. We'll replace your current modem with our newer model that supports the higher speeds, and there are no additional charges for that.

Customer: That sounds good. Um, one thing though—will there be any downtime? I'm asking because my wife has a couple of calls scheduled in the afternoon, and I want to make sure everything's back up and running before then.

Agent: That's smart planning. (chuckles) Typically there might be a brief moment where service drops during the switch—maybe five or ten minutes—but once the technician sets up the new modem and gets everything configured, you should be good to go. I'd recommend giving it maybe an hour after they leave just to be safe, but you should definitely be online well before any afternoon calls.

Customer: Alright, that's good to know. I appreciate that.

Agent: Of course. So we've got you down for tomorrow morning. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes with all the details and a direct number to call if anything comes up. Is the best contact number still 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's good.

Agent: (typing sounds) And your email is still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to go ahead and get this scheduled for you. (pause, typing sounds) And just so you're aware, we'll be upgrading your service effective immediately, so any usage after tonight will be on the new plan rate.

Customer: Okay, great. Is there anything else I need to do on my end?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. Just make sure someone's home tomorrow morning to let the technician in. They'll have their credentials and everything. If you have any questions about the new modem or how to connect your devices, they can walk you through it, or you can always call us back and we'll help you out.

Customer: Sounds perfect. Thanks so much, Derek. I really appreciate it.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being a loyal customer. You're going to love the speed upgrade. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too, thanks again!

Agent: Bye now!

Customer: Bye!
