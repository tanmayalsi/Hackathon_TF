# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And what name is the account under?

Customer: It's under Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. I've got you here. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that the service you're using?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've had it for about two years now, and honestly, it was fine when it was just me working from home part-time, but now my husband works from home full-time too, and we're both on video calls constantly. The speeds just aren't reliable enough anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. Video conferencing can really eat up bandwidth, especially with multiple users. Have you been experiencing buffering or connection drops?

Customer: Well, not exactly drops, but it definitely slows down when we're both on calls. And my son's upstairs doing online school, so it's three of us competing for bandwidth. It's just gotten really frustrating.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. So with three heavy users, you'd definitely benefit from a faster plan. Let me tell you what we have available in your area. (pause) Are you still in the same location on Maple Drive in Phoenix?

Customer: Yes, same place.

Agent: Great. So, we currently offer Fiber 200, Fiber 500, and our premium Fiber Gig service, which gives you one gigabit per second. Given your situation, I'd probably recommend either the Fiber 500 or the Gig plan, depending on your budget.

Customer: Okay, um... what's the difference in price between those two?

Agent: Good question. The Fiber 500 is 79.99 per month for the first year, then it goes to 89.99. The Gig plan is 129.99 for the first year, then 139.99 after that. Both come with no data caps and include our WiFi gateway at no additional charge.

Customer: (pause) Wow, that's quite a jump from what I'm paying now. What am I currently paying, just to remind myself?

Agent: You're on a promotional rate right now at 59.99 per month. So the Fiber 500 would be a $20 increase during the promotional period.

Customer: Hmm. And that would actually fix the speed issues, you think?

Agent: Absolutely. The Fiber 500 gives you 500 megabits per second, which is more than enough for three simultaneous video calls, streaming, and online schooling without any lag. The Gig plan would give you even more headroom, but honestly, for your use case, the 500 should be plenty.

Customer: Okay, that sounds like it could work. Are there any installation fees or anything like that?

Agent: Great question. Since you're already a Fiber customer, the upgrade is pretty straightforward. There's no installation fee—we can push the upgrade to your equipment remotely, and it typically takes effect within 24 hours. So no technician visit needed.

Customer: Oh wow, that's convenient. And I'd keep the same equipment?

Agent: Actually, you'd get a new WiFi gateway with the upgraded plan—it's a newer model that supports the faster speeds better. We'd ship that to you, and you'd just swap it out with your current one. It takes about five minutes.

Customer: That's simple enough. Um, I do have one more question though. My promotional rate ends next month, so if I upgrade now, does the new promotional pricing start over, or... how does that work?

Agent: (typing sounds) That's a really smart question. Yes, when you upgrade, you'll get a new two-year promotional period starting from today. So you'd have two years at the promotional rate before it adjusts to the standard rate. That's actually a pretty good deal.

Customer: Oh, okay, that's helpful. So... I think the Fiber 500 sounds like what I need. How do I go ahead with that?

Agent: Perfect. Let me just confirm a few things before we process this. You want to upgrade to Fiber 500 at 79.99 per month for the first 12 months, correct?

Customer: Yes.

Agent: And your contact number is still the one on file, 555-0147?

Customer: No, actually, I'd prefer to use my cell phone. It's 602-555-8834.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. Let me update that. 602-555-8834. And we'll send the new gateway to your address on Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Okay, wonderful. Just processing this here... (pause) And... done. Your upgrade is confirmed. You should see the new gateway arrive within 5 to 7 business days, and your service will be upgraded within 24 hours of the equipment shipment.

Customer: Great. So do I need to do anything on my end?

Agent: Just keep an eye out for the gateway. When it arrives, we'll send you an email with instructions on how to set it up, which is super simple. You literally just unplug your old one, plug in the new one, and you're good to go.

Customer: Perfect. I think that covers everything. Thank you so much!

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. We really appreciate your business, and I'm confident this upgrade is going to make a huge difference with your internet experience. If you have any questions during the installation process, just give us a call back, okay?

Customer: Will do. Thanks again, Marcus.

Agent: Have a great day, and thank you for choosing Frontier!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye!
