Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've had the same plan for like, three years now and it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one second here... and I'm looking at your account now. Perfect. I see you're currently on our 100 megabit plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. It was fine when I first got it, but now with everyone at home streaming and my kids doing school from home, it just feels slow. Plus my wife keeps complaining about lag when she's on her work calls.

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually really common, especially with multiple users on the network. The good news is we have some great options available. Can I ask what your typical internet usage looks like? Are you guys doing a lot of video conferencing, streaming, gaming, that kind of thing?

Customer: All of the above, honestly. (laughs) My son's always playing online games, my daughter's watching Netflix, my wife's got video calls for work... it's a lot.

Agent: Yeah, with that kind of usage, I'd definitely recommend looking at upgrading. We currently have our 400 megabit plan, which would be a huge jump for you, and we also just rolled out our new gigabit fiber service in your area. That's 1,000 megabits.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference? Would the gigabit be worth it?

Agent: Well, with 400 megs, you'd see a significant improvement over what you have now. That's plenty for multiple streams and video calls happening at the same time. But honestly, with your household's usage, the gigabit is gonna give you the absolute best experience. It means everyone can do what they need to do without any slowdowns at all. Plus, as fiber speeds increase in the future, gigabit gives you more headroom, you know?

Customer: I mean, that sounds good, but... how much more is that going to cost me?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so right now we're running a promotion. Your current plan is... (pause) looks like you're at $69.99 a month. Our 400 meg plan would be $99.99, and the gigabit service is $129.99. But here's the thing—if you commit to a two-year term, I can get you the gigabit for $99.99 a month, which is the same price as the 400 meg plan.

Customer: Oh, no kidding? For how long?

Agent: The promotional rate is guaranteed for 24 months. After that, it would go to the standard rate, which is currently $129.99, but I'm not gonna sugarcoat it—companies typically adjust their pricing over time, so it may increase. But you'd get those two years locked in at the lower price.

Customer: Hmm, that's tempting. Can I think about it, or... actually, wait. Do I need new equipment? Like a router or something?

Agent: Great question. So we will need to send out a technician to install a new fiber connection to your home, which is completely free. And yes, we'll provide a new modem and router combo unit that's compatible with our gigabit speeds. Your old equipment won't support those speeds, so we'll swap that out for you.

Customer: Is there gonna be any downtime? Like, how long does the installation take?

Agent: The installation typically takes about two to three hours, and yes, you'll be without internet during that time. But we can schedule it at a time that works best for you. We have availability pretty much throughout the week and weekends too.

Customer: (pause) Okay, and if I don't like it... like, what's the cancellation policy?

Agent: So with the two-year promotional pricing, there would be an early termination fee of $200 if you cancel before 24 months are up. However, we also have a 30-day trial period where if you're not completely satisfied with the service, we can refund your installation fee and give you 30 days to see how it works for you. Most customers end up staying because they really love the speed, but it's there if you need it.

Customer: Okay, that's fair. So... (pause) I think I want to do it. Can we go ahead?

Agent: Excellent choice! I think you're going to be really happy with this. Let me just confirm some information and get you scheduled. So the service address is still the same as on file?

Customer: Yeah, 4521 Maple Drive. Same address.

Agent: Perfect. And just to verify—that's in Portland, Oregon, 97214?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And are you still reachable at 555-0148?

Customer: Yeah, that's my cell.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm setting up your account upgrade here. We have an installation appointment available next Thursday, the 16th, between 10 AM and 1 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Next Thursday? Yeah, that should be fine. Will the technician call before they come?

Agent: Absolutely. They'll typically call about 30 minutes before they arrive, so you'll have a heads up. They'll also text you with a window. Now, is there anything else I can help clarify about the service or the installation?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Oh, wait—one thing. That modem you mentioned, do I keep that after, or do I have to send it back if I cancel?

Agent: That's included with your service, so it stays with you. If you were to cancel, we'd ask you to return it to avoid a equipment fee, but it's yours to use while you're a customer.

Customer: [inaudible] all right, good to know.

Agent: Perfect. So let me just recap everything for you. You're upgrading from 100 megs to our gigabit fiber service at $99.99 per month for the first 24 months, with a two-year commitment. Installation is scheduled for Thursday, December 16th between 10 AM and 1 PM. The technician will provide and install new equipment. You've got that 30-day satisfaction guarantee, and you'll receive a confirmation email within the next 15 minutes with all these details.

Customer: Sounds great. Thanks a lot for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! We really appreciate your business, and I'm confident you're going to love the gigabit speeds. If you have any questions before the installation or after, just give us a call back. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Perfect. Have a good one.

Agent: You too! Thanks for choosing Frontier.
