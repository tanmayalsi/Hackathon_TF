Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet. My current plan is just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And just to confirm, this is for the address on Maple Street in Portland?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm seeing here that you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. We've had it for about three years now, and honestly, my kids are doing remote school and my wife works from home, and we're all competing for bandwidth constantly. It's been really slow lately, especially in the evenings.

Agent: I totally understand. That's a pretty common issue when you have multiple people streaming and video conferencing at the same time. The good news is we have some great options available at your address. Let me tell you what we can upgrade you to.

Customer: Okay, perfect.

Agent: So right now you're on the 100 megabits per second plan. We have a Frontier Fiber 500 plan that would give you significantly more bandwidth, and we also have our Frontier Fiber Gig plan, which is our fastest option at one gigabit per second. What kind of activities are you mainly doing online?

Customer: Like I said, my kids have Zoom classes throughout the day, my wife's doing video calls for her job, and then I'm usually streaming something or downloading files for work. We probably have... I don't know, five or six devices connected at any given time?

Agent: Okay, with that kind of usage, I'd definitely recommend at least the 500 plan, but honestly, the Gig plan would be ideal for your situation. It would pretty much eliminate any buffering or lag you're experiencing.

Customer: How much more would that be? We're trying to be somewhat careful with our budget.

Agent: That's fair. So your current plan is $79.99 a month. The Fiber 500 would be $119.99, and the Fiber Gig is $159.99 per month. However... (pause) let me see what promotions I can offer you.

(typing sounds)

Agent: Okay, great news! Since you've been a loyal customer for three years, I can actually offer you the Fiber Gig plan at $129.99 for the first twelve months. After that, it would go to the regular rate. Does that sound more reasonable?

Customer: Oh wow, really? Yeah, that's... that's actually pretty good. How long is this offer valid for?

Agent: This offer is good for thirty days from today. So if you want to lock it in, we'd want to get you scheduled for the upgrade appointment soon. We can typically have a technician out within five to seven business days.

Customer: That sounds great. Um, one question though – will I need a new modem or anything?

Agent: Good question. The modem you currently have won't support gigabit speeds, so yeah, we'd provide you with our Frontier Fiber Gateway modem at no additional charge. The technician will install it for you during the same visit, so you won't have any downtime between the old and new equipment. It's pretty straightforward.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. And just to confirm, there's no contract or anything, right?

Agent: Correct. All our Frontier Fiber plans are month-to-month, so you have the flexibility to cancel anytime. No early termination fees.

Customer: Perfect. Yeah, let's do it then. Let's upgrade to the Gig plan.

Agent: Awesome! I'm really excited for you. This is going to make a huge difference with your household usage. Let me just get some information to schedule that appointment. What days work best for you? We have morning appointments between 8 AM and noon, or afternoon appointments between 1 PM and 5 PM.

Customer: Um, let me think. Today's Tuesday, right? How about... Thursday afternoon? Like between 1 and 5?

Agent: (typing sounds) Thursday afternoon works perfectly. I'm showing we have availability. The technician will arrive sometime during that window. You'll receive a text message and email confirmation with a more specific time window about 24 hours before the appointment.

Customer: Great, that works.

Agent: Perfect. And just to recap everything – you're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber Gig at $129.99 per month for the first twelve months, the technician will install a new modem at no charge, and your installation is scheduled for Thursday, January 16th, afternoon window. After your twelve-month promotional period, the rate will adjust to our standard Fiber Gig pricing, which is currently $159.99 per month, though you can always call us to discuss options at that time.

Customer: That all sounds right. Thank you so much, Marcus. I really appreciate you working with me on the price.

Agent: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier Communications, and we'll see you Thursday! Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye!
