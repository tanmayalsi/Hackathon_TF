# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet. My current plan just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. We've got some great options available. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: Uh, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing an account here for Sarah Chen at 4392 Maple Drive. Is that you?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Sarah. So you're currently on our Fiber 50 plan. Is that the one giving you trouble?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've been with you guys for about three years now, and it was fine when I first got it, but now I'm working from home and my husband streams a lot, and... (pause) ...it just seems like everything buffers, you know? Downloads take forever.

Agent: Yeah, I hear that a lot, especially with more people working remotely these days. The good news is that since you're in a fiber-served area, we can definitely get you bumped up to something faster. How does your current service feel during peak hours? Like in the evenings?

Customer: Oh man, that's when it's the worst. That's actually why I'm calling now. We tried streaming last night and it was just... it was really bad.

Agent: Okay, I feel you. So we have a couple of options for you. We can upgrade you to Fiber 100, which is double your current speed, or we have Fiber 200 if you want the really premium experience. We also just launched Fiber 500 for customers who really need that top-tier performance.

Customer: Wow, okay. Um... what's the price difference? I don't want to... I'm not trying to spend, like, a hundred dollars a month or anything.

Agent: (chuckling) No, I get it. So your Fiber 50 is currently at $79.99 a month, right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, so Fiber 100 would be $99.99 a month. That's only twenty bucks more. Fiber 200 is $129.99, and Fiber 500 is $179.99. Now, since you're a loyal customer—three years, that's great—I can actually offer you a promotional rate. If you upgrade to Fiber 100 today, I can lock you in at $89.99 for the first twelve months. After that it goes to the regular $99.99.

Customer: (pause) Really? That's... that's actually not bad. What about the Fiber 200?

Agent: For Fiber 200, I can do $119.99 for the first year, then it's regular price. And honestly? With working from home plus your husband streaming, that might be your sweet spot. You get nice speeds without going overboard.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, you know what, that sounds good. Let's do the 200. I want to make sure we're not having these problems anymore.

Agent: Excellent choice, Sarah. You're gonna be really happy with that. (typing sounds) So I'm gonna put that upgrade through right now. This won't interrupt your service at all—we'll just schedule the upgrade for... let me see what we have available. We can do this Thursday between 8 AM and 12 PM, or Friday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Uh, Friday afternoon is better. I have meetings Thursday morning.

Agent: Perfect. Friday afternoon it is. So that's this Friday, the 17th, between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will come out and upgrade your modem and make sure everything is configured correctly. The whole thing should take about thirty to forty-five minutes.

Customer: Okay, do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. Just make sure someone's home to let them in. Our tech will do all the heavy lifting. Oh, and one more thing—you're actually gonna want to restart your equipment after we're done, just to make sure everything syncs up properly. The tech will walk you through it though.

Customer: Okay, great.

Agent: (typing sounds) And I'm just adding a note here... because you've been such a great customer, I'm gonna waive the upgrade fee for you today. That's a $99 value.

Customer: Oh wow, really? That's so nice of you. Thank you!

Agent: Hey, we appreciate your business, Sarah. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. This is great. I'm excited to have faster internet.

Agent: Awesome. So just to recap, you're upgrading to Fiber 200 at $119.99 for the first year, technician appointment is Friday the 17th between 1 and 5 PM, and we've waived the upgrade fee. You should see a confirmation email here in just a few minutes with all those details.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you so much, Marcus.

Agent: Thank you, Sarah. Have a great rest of your day, and enjoy that faster internet!

Customer: You too, bye!

Agent: Bye now! (call ends)
