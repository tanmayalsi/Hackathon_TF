# Frontier Communications - Internet Upgrade Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on the 100 meg plan and I'm thinking about upgrading. My internet's been pretty good, but we just got a new smart TV and my kids are streaming a lot more now, and it's been kind of slow when everyone's using it at the same time, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. That's actually pretty common, especially with multiple devices running simultaneously. Let me pull up your account here real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Yeah, it's area code 603, 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing you're on our 100 megabit plan in the Manchester area, been a customer for about three years. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct. And like I said, it's been solid up until now, but we really need more speed.

Agent: Great. Well, you're in luck because we actually just expanded our fiber network in your area, and you have some excellent options. So right now you're at 100 megs. We offer 400 megabits, and we also have our gigabit plan at one gigabit per second. For a household with multiple users streaming and everything, I'd honestly recommend looking at either the 400 or the gig plan depending on your needs and budget.

Customer: Wow, okay. So what's the difference really? Like, would I notice that much of a jump?

Agent: Oh, absolutely. For streaming on multiple TVs, online gaming, video conferencing, all of that... (pause) with 400 megs, you'd be able to handle four or five simultaneous 4K streams without any issues. With the gigabit plan, you're looking at basically unlimited capacity for most home uses. You could have everything running at once and it wouldn't slow down.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. What are we talking price-wise? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, so for new service plans, I can get you on the 400 meg plan at $79.99 per month for the first year, and that goes to $89.99 after that. The gigabit plan is $109.99 for the first year, then $119.99 thereafter.

Customer: Hmm. So it's about... what, thirty bucks more a month for gig?

Agent: Right, exactly. It's $30 more monthly to jump from 400 to the full gigabit.

Customer: And do I need to change my equipment or anything?

Agent: That's a great question. You would need a new modem to support those speeds. The good news is we'll provide the gigabit-capable modem at no charge as part of the upgrade, and we can either have a technician install it for you, or if you're comfortable doing it yourself, we can just mail it to you and walk you through it over the phone.

Customer: Okay, I think a technician would be better. I'm not really the most tech-savvy person. (laughs)

Agent: No problem at all. We can definitely set that up for you. It usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes, and there's a one-time service fee of $99.99 for the installation.

Customer: Alright. And how soon could you get someone out here?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) We have some slots opening up this week. Would Thursday or Friday work better for you?

Customer: Uh, Friday is probably better. What times do you have?

Agent: (pause) We have a morning window between 8 AM and 12 PM, or an afternoon window from 1 PM to 5 PM on Friday.

Customer: The afternoon works for me. So that's 1 to 5 PM on Friday?

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) And just to confirm everything—you want to upgrade from your current 100 meg plan to the gigabit plan at $109.99 per month for the first year. We'll include the new modem, and you'll have a technician visit on Friday between 1 and 5 PM for installation. The installation fee is $99.99 one time.

Customer: Yeah, that all sounds right. Oh, and my current bill—will that change right away or...?

Agent: Good question. So your current bill will continue through the end of your current billing cycle, which looks like it ends on the 22nd. The new rate will kick in on your next bill after that. So you'll see the $109.99 starting on the 23rd, plus the one-time $99.99 installation fee on this upcoming bill.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. And I'm not locked into anything crazy, right? Like, if I hate it, I can downgrade?

Agent: You're on a month-to-month service plan, so you have full flexibility. You can upgrade, downgrade, or make changes anytime. Although I'm pretty confident you're going to love the gigabit speed. (laughs)

Customer: (laughs) Well, hopefully so. Alright, so Friday afternoon, one to five. Is there anything else I need to do before the technician comes out?

Agent: Just make sure you have someone home to let them in. They'll need access to your modem location and possibly your router. Other than that, you're all set. Oh, and I'm sending you a confirmation email right now with all the details—your appointment time, service address, and our technician's direct number so you can reach them if anything changes.

Customer: Awesome. That's really helpful. Thank you so much, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I'm excited to actually be able to stream without everything freezing. (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) Yeah, I think you're going to have a much better experience. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too!

Agent: Bye now!

Customer: Bye!
