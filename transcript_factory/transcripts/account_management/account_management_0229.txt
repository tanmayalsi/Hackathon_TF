Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you being a loyal customer. I'd be happy to help you explore our upgrade options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. One hundred megs down, I think?

Agent: Exactly. So what's prompting the upgrade today? Are you working from home, or...?

Customer: Yeah, actually, my wife and I both started working from home during the pandemic, and we never went back. We've got like four or five devices streaming all the time, plus the security cameras, the smart home stuff... it's just gotten ridiculous. Pages are loading slow, and we've had some video call dropouts. It's affecting work.

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally understand. Multiple video calls and streaming can definitely max out a hundred megs pretty quickly. (pause) So we've got a couple of great options for you. We offer Fiber 300, which is our most popular speed, or Fiber 500 if you want to really future-proof yourself. And we actually just launched Fiber Gig for customers in your area, which is our gigabit service.

Customer: Wow, a gigabit? Is that even necessary for... I mean, how much is that?

Agent: That's a great question. So the Fiber Gig is $99.99 a month for the first year, then it goes to $119.99. The Fiber 500 is $79.99 a month, and the Fiber 300 is $59.99. Now, I should mention these are promotional rates for the first twelve months.

Customer: Oof, okay. And after the year?

Agent: So the Fiber 300 would be $69.99 after year one, the 500 would be $89.99, and the Gig would be at that $119.99. But honestly, we run promos pretty regularly, so you might be eligible for another deal when your year is up.

Customer: Right, right. (pause) What's the actual difference between the 300 and the 500? Like, practically speaking?

Agent: Great question. So with Fiber 300, you're getting 300 megabits down and 20 up. With the 500, you're bumping that to 500 megs down and 50 up. The upload speed is actually pretty important if you're doing video calls—that'll give you cleaner video on your end going out.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So the 300 would probably be... like, enough?

Agent: Honestly? For what you described—two people on work calls, streaming, smart home devices—the 300 should handle that pretty comfortably. You'd have a lot of headroom. The 500 would be more if you think you might want to add more devices or if someone's doing like heavy video editing or something.

Customer: No, nothing like that. I think 300 sounds good. How quickly can you get that switched over?

Agent: Perfect. So the great news is since you're already in a fiber service area, there's no installation needed. We can process this upgrade right now, and it'll be active within the next 24 hours. You shouldn't have any service interruption.

Customer: Oh nice, so I don't have to... you're not sending a technician?

Agent: Nope, we don't need to. Your line already supports it. We just flip it on our end. (typing sounds) So let me just confirm the details here. You want to upgrade from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: And the billing address is still 487 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yep, that's still it.

Agent: Great. (pause) Okay, so the Fiber 300 is $59.99 a month for the first year. Your service will activate within 24 hours. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly, and we're also going to send you a quick how-to guide on speeds and what to expect. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: Um, one more thing. Will I need a new router?

Agent: That's a good thought. What router do you have right now?

Customer: I think it's... I'm not sure, honestly. It came with the installation years ago.

Agent: (pause) Well, if it's the one we provided, it might benefit from an upgrade to really take advantage of those 300 megs. We have a Frontier-approved router for $14.99 a month that would be optimal. But it's not strictly necessary—your current one might work fine, just slower.

Customer: How much difference would it make?

Agent: Honestly, you might not notice a huge difference in your case since you're not pushing a ton of devices. I'd say try it with your current router first, and if you're not getting the speeds you're expecting, just give us a call back and we can talk about upgrading the equipment.

Customer: Okay, I'll give that a shot. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. I really appreciate your business, and I think you're going to be really happy with that extra speed. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, I think that's everything.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for calling Frontier, and have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks.
