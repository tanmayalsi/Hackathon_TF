# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been with Frontier for about three years now, and I'm pretty happy with the service, but I'm thinking I need to upgrade. My internet has been feeling kinda slow lately.

Agent: I appreciate that, and I'm glad to hear you've had a good experience with us. Let me pull up your account here so we can see what you're currently on and what options might work better for you. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just for verification, what's the service address?

Customer: It's 2841 Maple Street in Portland.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got it. Alright, so I'm seeing here that you're currently on our 200 megabit per second plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. Like I said, it's been decent, but my wife has been working from home since, you know, the pandemic stuff, and we're both streaming and stuff. I think we need more speed.

Agent: That definitely makes sense. With two people online doing those activities, 200 Mbps can get tight. So what kind of things are you doing? Are you doing video calls, uploading files, that sort of thing?

Customer: Yeah, she's on Zoom calls constantly, and I've been getting into online gaming a bit more. Plus we'll have Netflix or YouTube going in the background. It just seems like things are buffering or getting laggy.

Agent: Mm-hmm, okay, that's really common with that usage pattern. So we actually have a couple of great options for you. We offer 500 megabits per second, which is our next tier up, and then we also have our gigabit plan, which is 1 gigabit per second—that's our fastest residential offering.

Customer: Wow, a gigabit? Is that... I mean, is that necessary? I don't want to pay for something I'm not gonna use, you know?

Agent: (pause) That's totally fair, and I appreciate you wanting to be smart about it. So the 500 Meg plan would be a really solid upgrade for your situation. That's 2.5 times faster than what you have now, so you'd have plenty of bandwidth for your wife's video calls, your gaming, and streaming all at the same time without any lag.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that sounds more reasonable. What would that cost me?

Agent: (typing sounds) So the 500 Meg plan is $79.99 per month for the first 12 months, and then it moves to $89.99 after that. And I'm looking at your current plan here... you're paying $54.99, so that would be an increase of $25 a month.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Is there any kind of promotion or anything you could do? I mean, I've been a loyal customer for three years...

Agent: You know what, let me see what I can find here. (typing sounds) I'm looking at what we have available... okay, so because you are a valued, long-term customer, I can actually offer you the 500 Meg plan for $69.99 a month for the first 24 months instead of 12. How does that sound?

Customer: That's better. That's... (pause) yeah, that's actually pretty good. But after 24 months it goes to $89.99?

Agent: Correct, yes. After the promotional period ends, it would go to $89.99 per month. But you could always call us back before that happens, and we can look at promotions again at that time.

Customer: Okay, okay. (pause) Yeah, alright, I think I want to do it. When could that be switched over?

Agent: Great! So the good news is I can get this set up for you right now. We have technicians available for installation tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM, or we can schedule it for later this week if you'd prefer. Would tomorrow work?

Customer: Tomorrow? Oh, uh... (pause) let me think. My wife will probably be home. She's... yeah, tomorrow should be fine. Afternoon is better anyway.

Agent: Perfect. So I have you down for tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. A technician will come out, and they'll upgrade your modem and router to equipment that supports those speeds. The whole process usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour.

Customer: Okay, do I need to do anything before they come?

Agent: No, just make sure someone's home to let them in. They'll bring everything they need. One thing—do you have a preferred location for your router? Like, a central part of your home?

Customer: Uh, we have it in the hallway upstairs right now. Would that be better somewhere else?

Agent: That's actually a great location, honestly. A hallway usually gives pretty good coverage throughout the house. The technician can assess it when they arrive and make recommendations if needed.

Customer: Cool, cool. So just to be clear, this is starting tomorrow, right?

Agent: That's correct. Your new plan will activate tomorrow when the technician completes the installation. They'll give you a call about 30 minutes before they arrive so you can plan for that window.

Customer: Awesome. And I should get something in the mail or... where's the confirmation?

Agent: (typing sounds) I'm sending a confirmation email to the address we have on file—is that still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Great. You'll get an email confirmation of the service upgrade and the installation appointment within the next few minutes. You can also log into your account online or through the Frontier app to view your appointment details anytime.

Customer: Perfect. I think that's everything. Thanks for working with me on the price, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: Absolutely, happy to help. We're really glad to have you as a customer, and I think you're gonna notice a huge difference with the speed upgrade. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now!
