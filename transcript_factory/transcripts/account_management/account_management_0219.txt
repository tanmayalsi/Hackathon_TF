Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you being a loyal customer with us. I'd be happy to help you explore upgrade options. Can I grab your account information first? I'll need your phone number or account number on file.

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. Let me just... there we go. I see here you're on our Fiber 50 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. It was great when I first got it, but now I'm working from home a lot more, and my partner streams constantly. We're both on video calls sometimes, and it just gets really slow and frustrating, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. Those speeds can definitely bottleneck when you've got multiple users doing bandwidth-intensive activities. (pause) Okay, so looking at what we have available in your area, we have a few options. You can upgrade to our Fiber 100 plan, which would double your download speeds, or we have Fiber 200 if you want more headroom for heavy usage. We also just launched a Fiber Gig plan in some areas. Let me check if you're eligible... (typing sounds) Unfortunately, that's not available at your address yet, but the Fiber 200 should be perfect for your situation.

Customer: Okay, what's the price difference? Like, how much more would I be paying?

Agent: So your current plan is $59.99 a month, right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: The Fiber 100 would be $79.99 per month, so that's twenty dollars more. And the Fiber 200 is $99.99 monthly. Now, I should mention we have a current promotion running. If you upgrade today, I can lock in the Fiber 200 at $89.99 for the first twelve months. After that, it would go to the regular rate.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad actually. What about installation? Would I need a technician to come out?

Agent: Great question. So since you already have our fiber infrastructure in place, the upgrade is really straightforward. We can do this entirely remotely. We'll just need to send you a new modem—that's complimentary—and our tech team will remotely configure everything on our end. You should be good to go within about 48 hours, and you won't need anyone coming to your home.

Customer: Nice, that's convenient. And I keep my same email and everything?

Agent: Absolutely. Nothing changes on your account except the speed tier. Same email, same billing, everything stays the same. (brief hold music) I apologize, just had a quick system notification. Okay, I'm back. So do you want to move forward with the Fiber 200 at that promotional rate?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. Can I ask one more thing though? Is there any kind of contract involved?

Agent: Good question. Our Fiber plans are month-to-month, so there's no long-term contract. You can cancel anytime, though I'm confident you'll love the speeds. (chuckles) The promotional rate is locked in for twelve months, so if you keep the service past that, it'll adjust to the regular $99.99 rate.

Customer: Alright, that works for me. Let's do it.

Agent: Excellent. I'm going to get this set up for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm confirming your service address here... still 4782 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yep, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And the best email to send your modem shipping information to would be the same [inaudible] on the account?

Customer: Um, actually, can you send it to my work email instead? It's [inaudible]@company.com. Let me spell that for you.

Agent: Of course, go ahead.

Customer: It's S-A-R-A-H dot K-L-E-I-N at company dot com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. Sarah Klein at company dot com. And we'll ship the new modem out today, so you should receive it by... looks like Friday at the latest. Once you get it, there's a quick setup guide included, but honestly, most customers just unbox it, connect the power and ethernet, and they're all set. You'll get a confirmation email when everything is activated on our end.

Customer: Great. That sounds easy.

Agent: It really is. So just to recap everything—we're upgrading you from Fiber 50 to Fiber 200, the promotional rate is $89.99 for your first twelve months, then $99.99 after that. New modem ships today, and you should be live by Friday. Sound good?

Customer: That's perfect, thank you so much.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything.

Agent: Wonderful. Well, I really appreciate you choosing Frontier, and thank you for sticking with us. You should see a significant improvement once you upgrade. If you have any issues when you receive the modem, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again, Marcus.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
