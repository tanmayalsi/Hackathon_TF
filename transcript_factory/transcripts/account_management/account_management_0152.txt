Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've had Frontier for about three years now and I'm pretty happy, but I'm working from home more these days and I think I need something faster.

Agent: That's great to hear you've been a loyal customer. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up real quick... Got it. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 200 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right. It's been fine for streaming and stuff, but when I'm on video calls for work, sometimes my upload speed just... it doesn't feel fast enough, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. Upload speed is really important for video conferencing. So with Fiber 200, you've got about 200 megabits download and 20 megabits upload. That can definitely be a bottleneck if you're doing multiple video calls. What kind of activities are you doing online besides the video conferencing?

Customer: Well, I do a lot of screen sharing, I download large files sometimes, and my wife also works from home now too. So we're both using the internet pretty heavily at the same time.

Agent: Ah, okay. Having two people working from home definitely increases the load. With screen sharing, file transfers, and simultaneous usage, I'd actually recommend looking at our Fiber 500 plan or even the Fiber 1 Gig option if you want some real breathing room there.

Customer: What's the difference between those two?

Agent: Good question. Fiber 500 gives you 500 megabits download and 50 megabits upload, so that's a nice step up. The upload speed especially will handle your video conferencing much better. Then the Fiber 1 Gig is our top tier—that's 1 gigabit download and 100 megabits upload. It's the top of the line and honestly, it's future-proof for just about anything you'd want to do online.

Customer: Wow, okay. How much more would those cost?

Agent: (brief pause) Let me check what we have available for you... So your current plan is... let me see here... (typing sounds) Looks like you're at $69.99 a month. If you upgrade to Fiber 500, we can get you that for $109.99 a month, so about forty dollars more. And the Fiber 1 Gig would be $149.99 a month.

Customer: Hmm, those are pretty big jumps. Do you have any promotions or bundle deals?

Agent: Actually, I'm glad you asked. We do have some current promotions. Are you bundled with us for phone or TV service at all?

Customer: Just the internet. We use streaming services instead of cable.

Agent: Right, totally understand. Let me see what I can do for you... (typing sounds) Okay, so I can offer you the Fiber 500 for the first twelve months at $89.99 a month instead of the regular $109.99. After that, it would go to regular pricing. How does that sound?

Customer: That's better. But I'm still not sure which plan I actually need. Can I try it out or something?

Agent: That's a reasonable question. Unfortunately, we can't really do a trial period, but I can tell you this—most of my customers who work from home with multiple people on the connection find that Fiber 500 is the sweet spot. You get that solid upload speed, and with 500 down, you're not going to have any congestion issues even with multiple devices. Fiber 1 Gig is more if you know you're going to have like, constant heavy usage or if you're a serious gamer or something.

Customer: And if I go with the 500, when could I get it installed?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability in your area... Great news—we have a tech available for installation as early as next Tuesday, March 12th, or we have openings on Thursday the 14th. Do either of those work for you?

Customer: Next Tuesday would be perfect actually. What time would they come?

Agent: We'd need a four-hour window, so the tech would arrive sometime between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. I'll be home anyway.

Agent: Perfect. And just to clarify—you'll keep your same modem and router, but we may need to swap them out to be compatible with the faster speeds. There's no additional charge for that, but the tech will let you know when they arrive. Any other equipment costs are waived with this promotion as well.

Customer: Oh good, I was worried about that. Okay, I think I'm ready to go ahead with the Fiber 500 plan.

Agent: Excellent choice. Let me just confirm all the details with you before we finalize everything. We're upgrading you from Fiber 200 to Fiber 500, promo rate of $89.99 per month for the first twelve months, then $109.99 after that. Installation is scheduled for Tuesday, March 12th between 8 AM and noon. The account number is... (pause) ...4472-8851. Does everything look good?

Customer: Yeah, that all sounds right. And this is for my whole account, right? Like the internet just gets faster?

Agent: That's exactly right. Your phone number and everything stays the same—we're just increasing your bandwidth. Oh, and you'll receive a confirmation email within the next couple hours with all these details and the technician's information.

Customer: Great. Is there anything else I need to do to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home during that window. The tech will need access to where your modem is currently located. Other than that, you're all set. We really appreciate your business, and I think you're going to be very happy with the speed upgrade.

Customer: Thanks Marcus, I appreciate your help. This should solve the problem.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you on Tuesday!

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
