Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey Derek, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet. I've had the same plan for like... three years now? And honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm seeing your account here. So you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. A hundred megs down, right?

Agent: That's right, 100 megabits per second download. And how long have you had that service with us?

Customer: Like I said, about three years. But lately my wife and I have been working from home more, and we've got our two kids doing online school, and... it's just been really slow. Especially in the evenings. I'll be on a Zoom call and it just... it buffers, you know?

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. That's actually pretty common when you've got multiple users streaming and doing video calls on the same connection. So what kind of speeds are you looking to upgrade to?

Customer: Um, I'm not really sure. What do you recommend? Like, what would be good for a family of four with everyone working and schooling from home?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great question. So for your situation, I'd typically recommend at least our Fiber 300 plan—that's 300 megabits down—or if you want to really future-proof yourself, the Fiber 500. That's gonna handle multiple video calls, streaming, online classes, all that stuff simultaneously without any issues.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference in price? I mean, I'm not trying to break the bank here.

Agent: (pause) I hear you. So your current plan is... looks like you're at $59.99 a month. The Fiber 300 would be $89.99 for the first year, then it goes to $99.99 after that. And the Fiber 500 is $119.99 for the first year, then $129.99.

Customer: Wow, okay. That's... (pause) ...that's a pretty big jump from what I'm paying now.

Agent: I know it seems like a lot, but let me just say—and I'm not just selling you here—but with the pricing right now, we're actually running a promotion. So new upgrade customers get the first year locked in at that promotional rate, and you also qualify for a waived installation fee, which normally runs about $99. So you're actually saving quite a bit on the front end.

Customer: Oh, okay. That's not too bad then. So you're saying the installation fee is free?

Agent: Absolutely. And one more thing—if you go with the Fiber 500, we can also throw in a complimentary upgrade to our premium WiFi router for the first year. Which, honestly, is gonna make a huge difference in your home coverage.

Customer: Really? That would be great. Our WiFi kinda has dead zones in the back part of the house. Would that help with that?

Agent: It definitely can. The premium router has better range and signal strength. Plus, with the 500 meg plan, you'll really be able to take advantage of those speeds throughout your home. So... are you leaning toward the 500?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think so. That sounds like the best option for us. Can you tell me when you could get someone out to install it?

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely. Let me check our availability. (pause) Okay, so we have openings this week. I'm seeing we have Wednesday or Saturday available. Do either of those work for you?

Customer: Wednesday would be better. What time?

Agent: (typing sounds) We have a morning window from 8 AM to 12 PM, or an afternoon window from 1 PM to 5 PM. Which would be more convenient?

Customer: The morning would be perfect. My wife doesn't have meetings until the afternoon.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, I've got you down for Wednesday, 8 AM to 12 PM. The technician will reach out the day before to confirm. Now, just to confirm everything—you're upgrading to the Fiber 500, which is $119.99 for your first year, promotional rate, with waived installation and the complimentary premium router upgrade. Does all that sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect. And my current plan—when does it switch over?

Agent: The new service will be active starting Wednesday after the technician leaves. You might experience a brief service interruption during the installation, maybe 10 or 15 minutes, but it should be seamless after that.

Customer: Okay, perfect. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: (typing sounds) Just make sure someone's home on Wednesday morning to let the tech in. They'll handle all the equipment swap-out and get everything configured for you. And if you have any questions after that, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you.

Customer: Awesome. Thanks Derek, I really appreciate this.

Agent: My pleasure! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thank you.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!
