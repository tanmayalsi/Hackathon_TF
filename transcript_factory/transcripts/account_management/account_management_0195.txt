# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I've been a customer for about three years now and I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Oh, great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Awesome, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 2834 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. I've got you here. So you're currently on our Fiber 300 plan, is that right? 300 megabits per second?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine for a while, but now I'm working from home most days and my partner streams a lot of shows, and we just... it's been pretty slow lately. Sometimes things just buffer forever.

Agent: I totally understand. With multiple people working and streaming simultaneously, 300 megs can definitely get tight. Are you having issues during specific times of day, or is it pretty consistent?

Customer: It's mostly in the evenings, you know, like around 6 to 9 PM. That's when everything just slows down.

Agent: Yeah, that's when most people are using their internet in the neighborhood, so that's pretty typical. Well, the good news is we have some great options for you. Let me walk through what we have available at your address. (pause) Okay, so we can upgrade you to our Fiber 500 plan—that's 500 megs down, 20 megs up. Then we also have Fiber 1000, which is a gigabit per second, and that comes with 35 megs upload.

Customer: Wow, a gigabit? That's... that seems pretty fast. What's the price difference?

Agent: So the Fiber 500 would be $79.99 a month, and the Fiber 1000 is $109.99. You're currently paying... (typing sounds) $69.99 for the 300 plan, right?

Customer: Okay, so an extra ten bucks for the 500, or forty for the gig?

Agent: That's right. Now, if you upgrade today, I can actually apply a promotional credit for you. We're running a special where if you sign up for a 12-month contract, we'll knock $20 off your first three months. So you'd be paying $59.99 for the Fiber 500 for the first quarter, then it goes to the regular rate.

Customer: Hmm, that's not bad. Do you have that same deal for the 1000?

Agent: For the Fiber 1000, the promo would be $30 off for the first three months, so that'd put you at $79.99. And then regular rate after that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, and what about the contract? I've heard some people say contracts with internet companies are... I don't know, restrictive?

Agent: That's a fair question. The 12-month contract just means that you commit to the service for a year. If you cancel before that, there's an early termination fee of $15 per month remaining on the contract. So if you canceled after six months, that'd be 180 dollars. But honestly, with the promotion we're offering, you're saving quite a bit, and most customers don't cancel during that timeframe anyway.

Customer: Right, yeah. Um... I think I'm leaning toward the gigabit plan. With both of us home, that extra speed would probably help a lot.

Agent: I think that's a smart choice, especially with your use case. And just so you know, gigabit speeds are really future-proof. Even if your usage changes, you're covered. (typing sounds) Okay, so let me just confirm the details here. You want to upgrade to Fiber 1000, and you're going with the 12-month contract to take advantage of the promotional pricing?

Customer: Yeah, let's do it.

Agent: Excellent. Now, I do want to let you know that when we upgrade you, there will be a service visit. It's free, but we will need to come out and potentially upgrade some equipment. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh, uh... how long does that take?

Agent: Usually about an hour, sometimes a bit less depending on what we need to do. We can schedule that for a time that works best for you. We have openings this Saturday, or we can look at next week if that's better.

Customer: This Saturday works. What time slots are available?

Agent: (typing) Let me see here... We have morning slots between 8 AM and 12 PM, or afternoon between 1 and 5 PM.

Customer: Morning would be better for me. Let's say 10 AM?

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to put you down for this Saturday at 10 AM. Our technician will call you about 30 minutes before arrival with a callback number. Can you confirm your phone number is still 555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's still the right number.

Agent: Great. And just to recap everything—you're upgrading to our Fiber 1000 plan at $109.99 per month, with a promotional rate of $79.99 for the first three months. You're committing to a 12-month contract. Your service visit is scheduled for this Saturday, [inaudible] 10 AM. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. When does the upgrade take effect?

Agent: Once the technician completes the installation on Saturday, you'll have access to the new speeds right away. You might want to restart your router after we leave, just to make sure everything is synced properly.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. Thanks a lot for walking me through all of this, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome! I really appreciate your business, and we're excited to get you set up with the gigabit speeds. You should notice a huge difference, especially during those peak hours. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks again!

Agent: My pleasure. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you Saturday morning!

Customer: Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
