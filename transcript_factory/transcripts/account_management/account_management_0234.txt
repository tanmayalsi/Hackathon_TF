Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan, and I'm thinking about upgrading to something faster. We've been working from home a lot more, and honestly, the speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I totally understand. Working from home definitely puts more demand on your connection. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you right here. So you're currently on the 500 meg plan... that's been active for about two years now. And you're looking to upgrade?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. What options do you have? Like, what's the fastest you guys offer in my area?

Agent: Great question. So we actually have some really solid options. In your area, we can get you up to our 2-gig fiber plan. That's our top tier. We also have a 1-gig option if you wanted something in the middle. Both would be a significant jump from where you are now.

Customer: Two gig? (pause) Wow, okay. That sounds... I mean, that's a lot faster. Is that overkill for, like, two people working from home?

Agent: (chuckles) It's a great question. Honestly, for two people, the 1-gig plan would probably be more than enough. You'd have plenty of bandwidth for video calls, downloads, streaming, all that stuff simultaneously. The 2-gig is really more for heavy users or larger households, but it does give you that future-proofing, you know?

Customer: That makes sense. What's the price difference? And... are there any promotions running right now?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so let me check what we have available for you. Our standard pricing for the 1-gig plan is $89.99 a month, and the 2-gig is $129.99. But actually, I'm looking here and we do have a current promotion... (pause) for new plan upgrades, you can get the 1-gig for $79.99 for the first twelve months, and then it goes to the regular price after that.

Customer: Oh, nice. So what about the 2-gig?

Agent: For the 2-gig, we can do $99.99 for the first year with the same promotion running. After that, it'd be the full $129.99.

Customer: (pause) Okay... so basically I'd save... what, like ten dollars a month with the 1-gig?

Agent: For the first year, yeah, you'd save $10 a month compared to the 2-gig promotional rate. But it also depends on what you think you'll actually use. Most customers in your situation go with the 1-gig and are really happy with it.

Customer: I think... I think the 1-gig sounds good. I don't want to pay extra for something I'm not gonna use, you know?

Agent: That's a smart call. You won't regret it, honestly. Alright, so I'm gonna get you set up on the 1-gig plan at that promotional rate. Now, do you still have the same gateway equipment, or...?

Customer: I think so? It's the white box thing, right?

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, that's probably it. Okay, when we activate your new plan, we can do a quick compatibility check. Your current equipment should be fine for the 1-gig speeds, so we shouldn't need to send you anything new.

Customer: Oh cool, so it's just a plan change?

Agent: Exactly. It's just a plan change. We'll update everything on our end, and the speeds should kick in within... usually within the next 24 hours. You might see it happen faster, but we like to say 24 hours to be safe.

Customer: That's awesome. When can we do this?

Agent: We can actually activate it right now if you'd like. It'll take me just a couple minutes to get everything set up in the system. Is there anything else I can help you with while we're at it? Any other services or...?

Customer: Uh... (pause) do you guys offer TV packages still?

Agent: We do, but I'm actually gonna be honest with you—a lot of customers these days are dropping TV and just going with streaming. But if you're interested, I can definitely transfer you to our video specialist. They can tell you about what we've got available.

Customer: Nah, I think we're good. Just the internet upgrade for now.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and process this upgrade for you. Your new rate of $79.99 a month for the 1-gig plan will show on your next billing cycle... (typing sounds) and you should receive a confirmation email within the next hour or so.

Customer: Great. Is there anything I need to do on my end?

Agent: Nope, not a thing. Just keep your gateway plugged in, and you should be all set. You might want to restart it once or twice over the next day just to make sure everything's syncing properly with the new speeds, but that's totally optional.

Customer: Will do. Hey, thanks Derek. I appreciate the help.

Agent: Of course! Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. If you have any issues or questions at all after the upgrade, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you right away.

Customer: Sounds good. Have a great day.

Agent: You too! Thanks for calling Frontier. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
