Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. So, um, I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet service. My current plan just doesn't seem to cut it anymore, especially with everyone working from home now.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me just pull up your account here real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, got you here. I'm seeing you're currently on our 100 Mbps fiber plan in the Phoenix area. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Honestly, it was fine for a while, but my kids are doing school online now, and my wife's got video calls going on constantly for work, and then I'm trying to stream in the evenings... it just keeps lagging.

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually one of the most common reasons we get upgrade requests, especially with multiple people using the internet simultaneously. (pause) So, what kind of speeds are you looking at? Are you interested in our 300 Mbps plan, or would you like to explore even faster options?

Customer: Um, I'm not really sure what the difference would be, to be honest. What would you recommend?

Agent: Great question. So, with your current 100 Mbps, you're getting good speeds for basic streaming and browsing, but when you have multiple users doing heavy bandwidth activities at the same time, like video conferencing and streaming, you can definitely notice slowdowns. Our 300 Mbps plan is really ideal for households like yours where there's a lot of simultaneous usage. And then we also have 500 Mbps and even 1 Gig if you wanted to future-proof yourself a bit.

Customer: (pause) Wow, 1 Gig seems like overkill, doesn't it?

Agent: For most people, yeah, honestly. I'd say the 300 Mbps would be a really solid fit for what you're describing. You'd see a huge difference in your experience, especially with the video calls and streaming.

Customer: Okay, okay. What's the pricing on that? And is there a contract or anything?

Agent: (typing sounds) So, our 300 Mbps plan is currently $79.99 a month. We do have a two-year promotional rate on that, which locks in that price. After that, it would go to regular pricing, but we can always revisit options at that time. Are you still in a contract with your current plan?

Customer: I don't think so? I've been with you guys for three years, so I feel like that would've been up by now.

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, I'm not showing any active contract on your account, so you're good there. The upgrade wouldn't lock you in to anything additional if you don't want it, but the two-year promotional rate is really the best pricing we have available right now.

Customer: Hmm, how much am I paying now?

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) You're currently at $64.99 for the 100 Mbps plan.

Customer: Okay, so that's about fifteen bucks more. Is there anything else? Like, are there any fees or anything?

Agent: Good question. So, the plan itself is $79.99. There is a standard equipment fee of $14.99 a month for the router, but that's factored into most plans. We also wouldn't charge you an upgrade fee since you're an existing customer in good standing. Taxes would apply on top of the monthly rate depending on your location, but that should give you the full picture.

Customer: So basically about $95 a month with taxes, give or take?

Agent: (pause) That sounds about right, yeah. It might be a couple dollars one way or the other depending on your specific tax jurisdiction, but you're in the ballpark there.

Customer: (pause) Can I think about it for a day or two?

Agent: Absolutely. You can think it over. But just so you know, this promotional rate is available through the end of this month, so I'd recommend making a decision before then if you're interested. We can also get you upgraded pretty quickly—most customers see their new speeds active within 24 hours, often the same day.

Customer: Oh really? That fast?

Agent: Yeah, the nice thing about fiber is that most of the time we can do it remotely, so there's no need for a technician visit. We just push a configuration update to your equipment, and you're good to go.

Customer: That's pretty cool. Okay, yeah, I think I'll probably do it. Can you just walk me through... what happens next?

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) So, what I'm gonna do is process this upgrade for you right now. It'll take just a minute. (pause) I'll set you up on the 300 Mbps plan at $79.99 a month, and we'll have that promotional rate locked in for two years. You should see the speed increase within the next 24 hours. You don't need to do anything on your end—no equipment swap, no technician needed.

Customer: Awesome. And I'll get some kind of confirmation?

Agent: Absolutely. We'll send you an email confirmation within the next couple hours, and you can also check your account online anytime to see the status of the upgrade. Is the email we have on file still good? (typing sounds)

Customer: Uh, it should be [inaudible] at Gmail. Does that match?

Agent: Let me check. (pause) Yes, that matches what I have here. Perfect.

Customer: Great.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, Derek—or, wait, that's my name. Sorry about that. You're all set. Your upgrade to 300 Mbps is officially in the system. You should start seeing those faster speeds tomorrow, and we'll send you that confirmation email shortly.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

Agent: Hey, no problem at all. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Great. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
