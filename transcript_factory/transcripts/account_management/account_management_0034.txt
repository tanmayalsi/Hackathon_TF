Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Marcus. So I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet plan. My service has been pretty good, but I feel like I'm not getting the speeds I need anymore, you know?

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got it here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've had it for about... maybe two years now? And it was great when I first got it, but now I'm working from home full-time and my wife streams a lot, and honestly the speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I totally understand. With two people using the connection simultaneously, 100 megabits can definitely get a little tight. What kind of activities are you mainly doing? Just so I can recommend the best plan for your needs.

Customer: Well, like I said, I'm doing a lot of video calls for work, so I need to be able to upload files and stuff. And then she's usually watching Netflix or sometimes Hulu in the background. And we've got a couple smart home devices... you know, the usual.

Agent: Right, yeah, that makes sense. So for your situation, I'd definitely recommend looking at our Fiber 300 or Fiber 500 plans. Those would give you plenty of headroom for what you're describing. The 300 would be solid for your use case, but if you ever want to future-proof a little bit, the 500 is really our sweet spot right now.

Customer: Okay, so what's the price difference? I'm not trying to break the bank here.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Great question. So your Fiber 100 is currently... let me see... $59.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, so the Fiber 300 would be $79.99 a month, and the Fiber 500 is $99.99. Now, I should mention we have a promotion running right now for existing customers upgrading their service. You'd get the first three months at $19.99 off each plan. So you'd be looking at $59.99 for the first three months on the 300, and then it goes to regular price.

Customer: Wait, really? So it'd be sixty bucks for three months?

Agent: Exactly. So it's actually the same price as what you're paying now, but you're getting triple the speeds. And then after that promotional period, it bumps to the $79.99.

Customer: (pause) That's... actually not bad. Can I ask — is there any contract or anything?

Agent: No, actually, and that's one of the best things about upgrading. There's no contract required. You can change your plan anytime. And just so you know, the upgrade itself wouldn't have any installation fees since we're already set up at your location. We'd just need to push a configuration change to your modem, which takes about 24 hours to fully activate. You might experience a brief service interruption, maybe 10, 15 minutes, but nothing major.

Customer: Oh okay, so I don't have to wait for a technician or anything?

Agent: Nope, you're all set there. It's all remote on our end. Though if for some reason there were any issues, we'd obviously send someone out at no charge.

Customer: That's good. Um, so I think the 300 sounds good for now. If we need more speed later, I could always upgrade again, right?

Agent: Absolutely. You can upgrade, downgrade, really modify your service anytime. There's no penalty for that whatsoever.

Customer: Okay, cool. Let's do it then. Go with the 300.

Agent: Excellent choice. (typing sounds) Let me just get a few things confirmed here. I have your service address as 4521 Maple Street, Apartment 2B, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And your email on file is [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Uh, actually no, it's been updated. It's my first name, last name, number seven, @gmail.com.

Agent: Ah, got it. (typing sounds) Can you spell that out for me just to be sure?

Customer: Yeah, it's J-A-S-O-N, M-I-L-L-E-R, seven, @gmail.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And just to confirm the billing — you want to keep that on your card ending in 4287, right?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. So I'm gonna go ahead and process this upgrade for you right now. (typing sounds) The Fiber 300 plan at $79.99 monthly with your three-month promotional pricing applied... (pause) Alright, it's all set. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes. The plan goes active tomorrow at 12:01 AM, so you'll start seeing those speeds right away. You might notice that brief service blip sometime in that window like I mentioned.

Customer: Perfect. Hey, I really appreciate this, Marcus. That promotion was a nice surprise.

Agent: Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's all. Thank you!

Agent: Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and thank you for calling in today. If you need anything in the future, just give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
