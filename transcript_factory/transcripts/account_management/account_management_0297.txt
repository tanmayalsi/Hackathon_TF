Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about two years now, and I'm really happy with your service overall, but I think I'm ready to upgrade. My internet speed just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate that feedback. We're glad you've had a good experience with us. I'd be happy to help you find a plan that better suits your needs. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I see your account. You're currently on our Fiber 200 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine when I first got it, but now I'm working from home full-time, and my wife, she streams a lot, and we've got cameras set up around the house... It just feels slow when we're both doing stuff at the same time.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. Working from home changes things, especially with multiple devices. (pause) Are you experiencing any specific issues? Like, is the service cutting out, or is it more about the speeds being insufficient?

Customer: No, no, it doesn't cut out. It's steady. It's just... I'll be on a Zoom call and she'll start streaming something in the bedroom, and things get sluggish, you know? We need something faster.

Agent: Absolutely. Well, the good news is you're in a great service area for us, and we have some excellent options. Right now, our Fiber 500 plan would be perfect for what you're describing. You'd get download speeds up to 500 Mbps, which should handle simultaneous streaming and work-from-home activities with no problem. We also have Fiber 1 Gig if you want maximum speeds.

Customer: (hesitating) Okay, so what's the price difference? I'm currently paying... I think it's around eighty-five dollars a month?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here... Yes, you're on a promotional rate of $84.99 per month. If you upgrade to the Fiber 500 plan, that would be $119.99 per month. However... (pause) let me check what promotions I can apply to your account as a valued customer.

Customer: Oh okay, yeah, that's a jump. What about that Fiber 1 Gig thing you mentioned?

Agent: That's $149.99 per month regularly, but again, let me see if I can help with the pricing. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at our current promotions. Because you've been a good customer for two years, I can offer you the Fiber 500 plan at $104.99 per month for the first twelve months, and then it goes to $119.99. Does that sound better?

Customer: Yeah, that's better. But is there any way to... I don't know, could you do anything on the Gig plan?

Agent: Let me see what I can do there. (brief hold) Okay, so for the Fiber 1 Gig, I can get you that promotional rate of $129.99 per month for the first year, then $149.99 after that. That way, you'd have the absolute fastest speeds available, and honestly, with the kind of usage you're describing, it wouldn't really be overkill.

Customer: (pause) That's pretty steep compared to what I'm paying now. What's the difference gonna be in speed between the 500 and the Gig?

Agent: Great question. The Fiber 500 gives you up to 500 Mbps download speeds, whereas the Fiber 1 Gig gives you up to 1,000 Mbps—twice as fast. For your situation with work-from-home and streaming simultaneously, both would actually work great, but the 1 Gig gives you headroom for expansion. Like, if you add more devices, more people working from home, future-proofing that sort of thing.

Customer: Hmm. You know what, let me think about it for a second... (pause) Okay, no, let's just go with the 500. That seems like the sweet spot. But you said there was that promotional rate for a year?

Agent: Yes, exactly. The Fiber 500 at $104.99 per month for the first twelve months, then it adjusts to $119.99 after that. You'll actually see that pricing reflected on your first bill after the upgrade.

Customer: Okay, and how soon can I get that set up? Do you have to send someone out or...?

Agent: Good question. Since you already have our Fiber service at your location, we may not need a technician visit at all. We can upgrade your modem to one that supports those higher speeds, and we can either mail that to you or schedule a quick tech visit—usually just fifteen or twenty minutes—to swap it out and make sure everything's connected properly.

Customer: Oh, so I don't have to buy a new modem?

Agent: No, we'll provide it as part of the upgrade. You just return the old one. We can have the new modem to you within three to five business days if you want it mailed, or I can schedule a technician for you. What works better?

Customer: (pause) I think mailing it is fine. I'm pretty comfortable hooking stuff up.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm gonna process this upgrade for you now. You'll get the new modem within three to five business days. You should also receive an email confirmation with all the details. The upgrade will be effective immediately on your account, so your new rate starts on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Sounds good. And just to confirm, there's no contract or anything like that?

Agent: No, there's no long-term contract. That promotional rate is guaranteed for twelve months, and after that, the standard rate applies. But you're free to change plans anytime.

Customer: Great. And just so I'm clear, that old modem... I just wait for the new one to arrive and then send the old one back?

Agent: Exactly. We'll include a prepaid return label in the box with your new modem, so you just package up the old one and drop it off. Super easy.

Customer: Okay, awesome. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: (pause) Let me think... No, I think we're all set. Your upgrade is processed. You should see the new rate on your next bill, and the modem will be arriving soon. If you have any issues once it arrives, or if you need any help setting it up, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks, Derek, I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we hope you enjoy those faster speeds. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
