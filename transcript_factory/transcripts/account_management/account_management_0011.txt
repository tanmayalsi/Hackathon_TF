# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm calling because I'd like to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you calling in, and I'm happy to help you explore upgrade options. Let me just pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 50 plan at $59.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. We've had it for a while now, and honestly, with my wife working from home and my kids doing online school, we're constantly buffering and having connection issues. It's become really frustrating.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. Multiple people working and studying from home definitely puts a strain on those speeds. (pause) So the 50 Mbps just isn't keeping up with the demand anymore?

Customer: Exactly. And I know fiber is supposed to be really fast, so I'm wondering what else you have available in our area.

Agent: Great question. So the good news is that fiber is absolutely fantastic for what you're describing. We have some excellent options that would be perfect for your household. Let me just verify what's available at your service address. (typing sounds) You're at 4821 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: (typing, pause) Wonderful. So at your location, we have three upgrade options available. You've got our Fiber 100 plan at $79.99 a month, our Fiber 300 plan at $99.99 a month, and our Fiber Gig plan which is 1 gigabit per second at $129.99 a month. (pause) For your situation with multiple people online, I'd honestly recommend looking at either the 300 or the Gig plan.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference between those two? Is it really worth going all the way to the gig?

Agent: That's a smart question. (pause) So the Fiber 300 gives you 300 Mbps download speeds, which is... it's excellent. That'll handle multiple video calls, streaming, online school—all at the same time without any issues. The Gig plan, you're getting ten times that speed with 1,000 Mbps. (pause) Honestly, unless you're doing a lot of really heavy uploading, like video editing or huge file transfers, the 300 plan should be more than sufficient and it saves you thirty bucks a month.

Customer: Hmm, that makes sense. And there's no, like, data cap or anything with these speeds?

Agent: Nope. (pause) All of our fiber plans are unlimited data. That was one of the big advantages of fiber—you're not dealing with caps. You can stream, download, do whatever you need without worrying about hitting any limits.

Customer: That's awesome. Okay, so I think the 300 plan sounds like it would work for us. How quickly can you get that set up?

Agent: Excellent choice. (typing sounds) So since you already have fiber to your address and we're just upgrading your existing service, this is actually really straightforward. I can get this processed today, and the upgrade will go live on your next billing cycle. (pause) When's your next billing date?

Customer: Um, I think it's the 15th of next month. Is that when the new speed would kick in?

Agent: Actually, let me check that. (typing sounds, pause) I'm seeing your next billing cycle is November 15th. So what I can do is process this upgrade to start on that date. Now, the speed increase itself should take effect pretty much immediately once it's active in our system. You shouldn't need a technician visit since you already have the infrastructure in place.

Customer: Oh wow, so I don't have to have anyone come out? That's great.

Agent: Right, exactly. You're all set. (pause) Your current modem should be able to handle the new speeds without any issues. But if you start noticing any problems with your connection, just give us a call back and we can troubleshoot or potentially look at a newer modem.

Customer: Okay, perfect. And just to confirm, the price would be $99.99, right?

Agent: Yes, $99.99 a month for the Fiber 300 plan. (pause) You're also eligible for our loyalty discount—let me see if I can apply that for you. (typing sounds, pause) Actually, I can take $10 off your first three months, so you'd be looking at $89.99 a month for the first quarter. After that, it'd be the regular $99.99.

Customer: Oh, that's great! I appreciate that. So is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: (pause) Let me just review everything we've got here. So you're upgrading from Fiber 50 to Fiber 300, starting November 15th. You're gonna save—well, you're actually paying more, but you're getting a $10 discount for the first three months. (pause) Do you have an email address where I can send you a confirmation of this change?

Customer: Sure, it's sarah.mitchell@email.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. (pause) And just to be clear, is the best number to reach you that 555-0147, or do you have a different number?

Customer: That number works fine.

Agent: Great. (pause) Alright, Sarah, I've got everything processed here. You should see a confirmation email within the next few minutes. If you have any issues with the new speeds or if you don't see that email, just give us a call back. Our number's on your bill, but you can also dial 1-800-FRONTIER.

Customer: Awesome. Thank you so much, Marcus. I really appreciate your help.

Agent: My pleasure. Thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer, and I'm confident these new speeds are really gonna make a difference for your household. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Perfect. You have a great day, Sarah, and thanks for choosing Frontier.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
