Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So I'm currently a customer and I've been looking at my internet speeds and... I think I need something faster. I'm working from home now and the current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Oh, I understand completely. We've had a lot of customers in that situation. Working from home definitely puts more demand on the connection. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your phone number or account number to look that up?

Customer: Yeah, it's... (pause) ...555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing here that you're on our 200 megabit per second plan with us right now. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine before, but now that my wife started remote work too, and we've got the kids doing school stuff online... it just gets really slow sometimes. Especially in the evenings.

Agent: Yeah, that's very common. Multiple devices streaming and video conferencing at the same time can really slow things down at peak hours. So what kind of speeds are you thinking about upgrading to? We have options ranging from 400 meg all the way up to our gigabit service, which is 1,000 megabits per second.

Customer: Um, what would you recommend? I don't want to overpay, but I also don't want to deal with buffering anymore.

Agent: (pause) Well, it really depends on how many devices you'll have running simultaneously. With two people working from home, plus kids streaming videos, I'd probably recommend our 500 megabit plan. It's a nice sweet spot and definitely more than enough to handle multiple 4K streams and video calls without any issues. The gigabit plan is fantastic, but if you're not doing anything like content creation or heavy downloads, the 500 meg plan will serve you really well.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. What would the pricing be like? How much more would I be paying?

Agent: Great question. So right now, your 200 meg plan is... (typing sounds) ...let me see here. You're at $69.99 a month. If you upgrade to our 500 megabit plan, that would be $89.99 per month.

Customer: Oh, that's not too bad. How long is the commitment on that?

Agent: So we do have a two-year service agreement at that price. And just so you know, you're actually not currently under a contract—your original agreement expired a few months ago—so you're flexible. But with the two-year agreement, we can lock in that $89.99 rate for the full two years.

Customer: Okay, okay. And how soon could you get that set up? Like, would I have to schedule an appointment or anything?

Agent: Ah, good news there. Since you already have our service and we just need to upgrade your plan, we can actually make this change today, and it'll take effect on your next billing cycle. No technician visit needed. However, depending on your current equipment, you may need a modem swap. Can you tell me what modem you have right now?

Customer: Um... (pause) ...I'm not actually sure. It's just the white box under the TV. It's got lights on it.

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, that describes most of them. No worries. I can check our records here. What I'm seeing is you have an older model that won't support those higher speeds. So we would need to send you a new modem, which is included in the service at no additional cost. It should arrive within three to five business days.

Customer: Oh perfect, that works. And I'll be able to install it myself, right?

Agent: Absolutely. It's pretty straightforward. We'll include instructions with it, and our setup is really plug-and-play. You'll basically just swap out the old one, plug in the new one, and it'll auto-configure. Once it boots up, you should see a significant speed improvement right away.

Customer: That's awesome. Let me just make sure I have this straight—I'm upgrading to the 500 meg plan at $89.99 a month, two-year agreement, and you guys are sending me a new modem. Anything else I need to know?

Agent: (typing sounds) That's correct. And let me just confirm your service address and contact information on file to make sure everything is up to date before we finalize this. You're still at 4521 Maple Drive in Allentown?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And the best phone number to reach you is the 555-0847 we used to pull up your account?

Customer: Yep, that's the one.

Agent: Excellent. So I've gone ahead and processed your upgrade here. Your new rate of $89.99 will start on your next billing date, which is the 15th of next month. You should receive that new modem within three to five business days, and I'm gonna send a confirmation email to [inaudible] on file with all the details and setup instructions. Do you have any other questions for me?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. You've been really helpful, Marcus. Thanks.

Agent: My pleasure! Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and welcome to the 500 meg club. (laughs) You're gonna love the speeds. If you need anything else or have any trouble with the modem when it arrives, just give us a call back and we'll get you sorted out right away.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again!

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
