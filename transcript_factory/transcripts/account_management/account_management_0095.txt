# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've got the 100 meg plan right now and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. We've definitely seen a lot of customers needing more speed these days, especially with everything going online. Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to verify, is this for the address on Maple Street in Salem?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect, got it. So you mentioned you're on the 100 meg plan currently. What's driving the need for an upgrade? Just curious.

Customer: Well, I work from home most days now, and my wife streams during the day too. We've got like three or four devices going at once sometimes, and honestly, the speed just feels sluggish. Plus my son is always gaming online in the evenings, and I think the bandwidth is just... (trails off) ...it's just not enough anymore.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. So with multiple people using video conferencing, streaming, and gaming simultaneously, you'd definitely benefit from a faster plan. (pause) So we have a couple of options here. You could go up to our 300 meg plan, or if you really want the best performance, we've got our gig plan—that's one gigabit per second. The gig plan would definitely handle everything you're throwing at it.

Customer: What's the price difference? Like, how much more are we talking?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so your current plan is... let me see here... looks like you're at $59.99 a month. The 300 meg plan would be $79.99, so that's about twenty bucks more. And the gig plan would be $99.99.

Customer: Hmm. So forty more a month for the gig plan?

Agent: That's right. And I should mention, we actually have a promotion running right now for new upgrades. If you go with the 300 meg plan, we can lock you in at $69.99 for the first twelve months. Then it goes to the regular rate after that.

Customer: Oh, really? That's not bad. But what about the gig plan? Is there a promo on that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check... (pause) Yes, actually, we do have an offer. For the gig plan, we can do $89.99 for the first year. After that, it would be the full $99.99.

Customer: Okay, so that's still thirty bucks more than my current plan even with the promo.

Agent: It is, yeah. But you'd be getting ten times the speed, which really makes a difference with four people online. The gig plan is honestly overkill for most people, but with your usage, it might be worth it. That said, the 300 meg plan is a really solid middle ground. Most people find that's plenty for a household like yours.

Customer: (pause) I think... I think I'll go with the 300 meg plan. The difference between that and the gig plan is still pretty steep, and honestly, I don't need that much speed. I just need more than what I have.

Agent: That's a great choice. I think you're gonna be really happy with that speed. So let me just confirm the details here—we're upgrading you from the 100 meg to the 300 meg plan, and you'll get the promotional rate of $69.99 per month for twelve months, then $79.99 after that. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. When can that happen? Like, how soon can you get me upgraded?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great question. So, I can process this upgrade for you right now, and it would take effect within 24 to 48 hours. You shouldn't experience any service interruption—it's all done from our end, no technician visit needed since you already have our fiber service installed.

Customer: Oh, that's perfect. Yeah, let's do it.

Agent: Excellent. Before I finalize this, I just want to let you know that you'll receive a confirmation email within the next hour with all the details of your new plan. And if you notice any issues with the speed increase, which is unlikely, but just in case, you can always reach out to our support team and we can troubleshoot.

Customer: Okay, perfect. And this new rate is locked in for a year, right?

Agent: That's correct. Locked in for twelve months. After that, it'll go to the regular rate of $79.99 per month unless you decide to cancel or make any other changes.

Customer: Got it. Thanks, Marcus. I appreciate the help.

Agent: You're very welcome! I'm happy I could help. Just to recap, your new 300 meg plan will be active within 24 to 48 hours, and you should see that promotional price reflected on your next bill. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and thanks for calling in today. You have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
