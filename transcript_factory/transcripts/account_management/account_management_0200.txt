Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause, typing) Awesome, I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I mean, it was fine for a while, but now I'm working from home more, and my wife streams constantly, and honestly the speed just isn't there anymore. We're getting a lot of buffering and lag.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. Working from home and streaming simultaneously can definitely eat up bandwidth. How many devices are typically connected at the same time in your household?

Customer: Oh man, at least five or six. There's my work laptop, my wife's iPad for streaming, our phones... I mean, we even have a smart TV and a Ring doorbell now. It adds up.

Agent: Right, definitely. Well, the good news is we have some great options for you. So the Fiber 100 plan gives you about 100 megabits per second download speeds. We also offer Fiber 300, which is 300 Mbps, and our top tier is Fiber 500 at 500 Mbps. For your situation, I'd probably recommend starting with the Fiber 300. That should handle multiple users streaming and your work-from-home needs pretty comfortably.

Customer: Yeah, okay. What's the price difference on that?

Agent: (typing) So right now, you're on Fiber 100 at $79.99 a month. The Fiber 300 plan is $99.99 a month, so that would be an additional $20 per month.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, and what about the 500? How much more is that?

Agent: The Fiber 500 is $129.99 a month. Now, just so you know, with that jump you're getting almost five times the speed, so it really depends on what you think you'll need. But honestly, between you and me, for most households, the 300 plan is the sweet spot.

Customer: I mean, if we're gonna do this, maybe we should just go for it and get the 500. Like, we're probably not gonna upgrade again for a while, right?

Agent: (slight chuckle) That's not unreasonable. And if you want future-proofing, yeah, the 500 is solid. Plus, you know, if you ever add more devices or your usage changes, you're covered. Let me just check something here... (typing) Okay, so I should mention we actually have a promotional offer running right now. If you upgrade to either the 300 or the 500 today, I can waive the installation fee, which is normally $99.

Customer: Oh, nice! That helps. Okay, let's do the 500 then.

Agent: Perfect. (typing) Just to confirm, you want to upgrade from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500. The new monthly rate will be $129.99, and we'll waive the $99 installation fee. Your service will be live within 24 to 48 hours typically. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's great. And I don't have to do anything special, right? Like, my modem and router—will those work with the new speeds?

Agent: Great question. So, what modem model do you have? Can you check the back of it real quick?

Customer: (pause, background sounds) Um, it says... Frontier something... it's model FX-4200 I think?

Agent: Okay, actually we're gonna need to swap that out. The FX-4200 maxes out around 200 Mbps, so it won't support the full speeds of your new Fiber 500 plan. But don't worry, we'll send you an upgraded modem at no additional charge, and it'll arrive about the same time your service upgrade processes. You'll just need to swap them out—it's really simple, just unplug the old one and plug in the new one.

Customer: Oh okay, perfect. And you don't need to send a technician or anything?

Agent: Nope, for an upgrade like this, we can do it all remotely. The modem will have instructions in the box, but honestly, it's pretty straightforward. If you run into any issues, just give us a call back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Awesome. When should I expect all this to happen?

Agent: So we're looking at your service upgrade hitting your account within the next 24 to 48 hours. The modem should arrive within five to seven business days. In the meantime, you might experience a brief interruption—maybe 15 or 20 minutes—when the upgrade processes, so you might want to plan that around your work schedule if possible.

Customer: Okay, got it. Anything else I should know?

Agent: (pause) Let me see here... Oh, just so you're aware, the promotional pricing for the waived installation fee is locked in for today only. Your plan rate of $129.99 is our standard rate, no promotional discount on that unfortunately, but it's a great price for that speed. And make sure you take note of your new modem's password when it arrives—it'll be on the bottom of the device—in case you ever need to reconnect.

Customer: Got it. That all sounds good.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just go ahead and process this upgrade for you now. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, and... all set. I'm sending a confirmation email to [inaudible]@frontier.net. You should receive that within the next few minutes with all the details and your new account summary. Do you have any other questions for me today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks Derek.

Agent: Great, thanks so much for calling Frontier, and welcome to Fiber 500! We really appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now.
