# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've got some great options available. Before we dive in, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 2847 Elm Street?

Customer: Yes, that's the one.

Agent: Excellent. So I'm seeing here that you're currently on our 300 megabit plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've had it for about two years now, and honestly, it was fine for a while, but lately it's been pretty slow. I work from home and I've got two kids constantly streaming stuff, so...

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. Three hundred megs can definitely get stretched thin with that kind of usage. Good news is that we just upgraded our network in your area, and we're now offering speeds up to 2 gigabits. That's more than six times what you're currently getting.

Customer: Wow, okay. Two gigs? That seems like... a lot, but honestly, that might be what I need.

Agent: It really is a game-changer for households like yours. Let me walk you through what we have. We offer that 2-gig plan, which is our top tier. We also have a 500-meg plan and a 1-gig plan as middle options. What kind of activities are you mostly doing at home? Besides the streaming and work stuff?

Customer: Um, I do video conferencing pretty much all day for work. And like I said, the kids are always on Netflix or YouTube. We've got a couple of smart home devices too, so everything's connected these days.

Agent: Right, yeah. With video conferencing, you definitely need reliable upload speeds too, not just download. The 2-gig plan would give you amazing speeds in both directions. But I also want to be upfront about pricing. That does come at a premium. Would you like to hear the rates?

Customer: Yeah, let's hear it. What are we talking?

Agent: (pause) So our 2-gig plan is currently $119 a month for the first year, and then $149 after that. The 1-gig is $89 for year one, then $119 after. And the 500-meg would be $59 to $79. Where does that fit with your budget?

Customer: Hmm. (pause) The 2-gig sounds good, but that's... that's a pretty big jump from what I'm paying now. What am I currently paying?

Agent: (typing sounds) Looks like your current bill is $69 a month.

Customer: Right, so... fifty bucks more a month. (pause) Do you have any promotions or anything like that? I've been a loyal customer for how long... let me think...

Agent: Let me check that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so you've been with us for about four years now. And yes, actually, I can absolutely help you out there. We have a loyalty promotion that I can apply. I can extend that introductory rate of $119 to two years instead of one. How does that sound?

Customer: Two years? (pause) That's better. But is there anything else? Like, free installation or...?

Agent: Good question. Installation is actually free for existing customers like yourself. And we'll ship out a new modem and router at no charge as well. The 2-gig service does require our newer equipment to handle those speeds anyway, so that all gets included.

Customer: Okay, okay. I think I'm leaning toward the 2-gig then. What's the process from here?

Agent: Great choice. So what I'll do is process the upgrade in the system right now. (typing sounds) I'm updating your account... Your new service will be activated within the next 24 to 48 hours. You should get an email confirmation shortly with all the details. The equipment will arrive within 3 to 5 business days, and we'll include instructions on how to set it up. It's pretty straightforward, but if you need any help, you can always give us a call back.

Customer: Do I need to do anything to my current equipment?

Agent: You can keep it unplugged and set it aside once the new equipment arrives. You don't need to ship it back or anything—we'll just handle it from our end. Or if you prefer, you can actually drop it off at any of our retail locations.

Customer: Okay, cool. And the speeds... they're guaranteed?

Agent: Well, with fiber internet like ours, you're going to consistently get speeds very close to what's advertised. The 2-gig plan will deliver up to 2 gigabits. In real-world usage, you might see slightly less due to things like WiFi range or device limitations, but it's going to be a night and day difference from what you've got now.

Customer: That's good to know. Alright, I think... I think I'm ready to do this.

Agent: Awesome. Let me just confirm a couple more things here. Your service address is still 2847 Elm Street, zip code 90210?

Customer: Yes.

Agent: (typing sounds) And your phone number is still 555-0149?

Customer: Actually, that changed. It's 555-0182 now.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it, updating that now. Perfect. So just to recap what we've done today: you're upgrading from the 300-meg plan to our new 2-gig fiber plan at $119 a month for the first two years, then $149 after. Installation and equipment are free. You should see the service activated within 24 to 48 hours. Do you have any other questions before we wrap up?

Customer: I don't think so. How long is the contract?

Agent: (pause) With this plan, we do ask for a two-year commitment. That aligns with the promotional pricing I gave you. After that, you're month-to-month if you want to make any changes. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that works. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. Enjoy those blazing fast speeds!

Customer: Thanks. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
