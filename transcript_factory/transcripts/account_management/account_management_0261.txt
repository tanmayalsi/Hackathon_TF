Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you choosing Frontier. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Before we dive in, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Alright, I'm seeing an account for Jennifer Martinez at 442 Oakwood Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, which gives you 100 megabits per second download speeds. Is that the service you're referring to?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Look, I work from home now—I didn't before—and I'm constantly in video calls, uploading files, and honestly, the connection just feels sluggish sometimes. My roommate is also using the internet, so... (trailing off)

Agent: Oh, that makes total sense. Video conferencing and file uploads can definitely eat up bandwidth, especially with multiple users on the network. The good news is we have some great options that would probably work really well for your situation. We offer Fiber 300, which is three times faster than what you have now, and we also have Fiber 500 and our premium Fiber 1-gig service.

Customer: Okay, so what's the price difference? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (pause) Absolutely, I understand. So your current plan is $59.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Alright, so if you upgraded to our Fiber 300 plan, that would be $79.99 a month. That's a $20 increase. Fiber 500 would be $99.99, and our Fiber 1-gig is $129.99. Now, I should mention that since you're an existing customer, I can actually apply a promotional rate for the first twelve months on any of these upgrades.

Customer: Oh really? What kind of promotional rate are we talking about?

Agent: For the Fiber 300, I could get you that promotional rate of $64.99 for your first year, and then it would go to the regular $79.99 after that. For Fiber 500, it would be $84.99 for the first year.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, so if I go with the Fiber 300, I'd save about fifteen bucks a month for the first year?

Agent: Exactly right. You'd save $15 a month for the first year, and honestly, for your use case with working from home and having another person on the network, I think the Fiber 300 would be a solid upgrade. You'd have plenty of bandwidth for video calls without any lag, and file uploads would be noticeably faster.

Customer: And there's no, like, installation fee or anything like that, right? Because I've heard about those hidden fees before.

Agent: Great question. Since you're already an existing customer with our equipment installed, there's no installation fee. The technician would just need to come out and swap your modem and router for our newer Fiber 300-compatible equipment. That service call is completely free.

Customer: Okay, that's good. How long would that take?

Agent: The appointment typically takes about an hour, sometimes a little less if everything goes smoothly. I can check our availability for you. What days work best for you? We have availability Monday through Saturday, between 8 AM and 5 PM.

Customer: Um, probably a weekday evening would be better. Do you have anything after 5 PM?

Agent: (typing) I'm actually looking at our schedule now... unfortunately, our latest appointments on weekdays are at 5 PM. However, we do have some morning slots available if you could make that work—like tomorrow at 10 AM, or we have Thursday morning at 9 AM.

Customer: (sighs) Can I do Saturday? That would be way easier for me.

Agent: Absolutely. Let me see... we have a few Saturday slots. How about this Saturday, March 16th, between 1 and 3 PM? Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, that actually works. Let's do that.

Agent: (typing) Perfect. I'm getting you scheduled for Saturday, March 16th between 1 and 3 PM for your Fiber 300 upgrade. A technician will come out and take care of the equipment swap. You should receive a confirmation text message and email within the next few minutes with all those details.

Customer: Great. And just to confirm, it's $64.99 a month for the first year with the Fiber 300?

Agent: That's right, $64.99 for twelve months, and then it adjusts to $79.99 after that. And this promotional rate is locked in—it won't change until after the first year.

Customer: Awesome. And the speed is... 300 megabits?

Agent: Correct, 300 megabits per second download speeds. That's definitely going to handle multiple video calls and file uploads with no problem.

Customer: Perfect. I think that's everything. Thank you, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. We really appreciate your business, Jennifer. Is there anything else I can help you with today before I let you go?

Customer: No, I think that covers it.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great rest of your day, and we'll see you on Saturday!

Customer: Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now!
