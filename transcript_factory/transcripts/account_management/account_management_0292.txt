Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with your service, but I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Oh, that's great to hear! I'm glad you've had a good experience with us. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... one second... alright, I've got you. I'm showing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan at 100 megabits per second. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Perfect. And just out of curiosity, what's prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, streaming, or...?

Customer: All of the above, honestly. I work from home now, my wife streams Netflix constantly, and I've got like three kids all doing homework online. So it's just... it gets pretty slow during peak hours, you know?

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, I totally understand. That's a pretty heavy household bandwidth situation. Well, the good news is you're in a Fiber service area, so we have some excellent options for you. We offer Fiber 300, Fiber 500, and our Fiber Gig plan, which is 1 gigabit per second.

Customer: Wow, okay. So what's the difference in price between those?

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, so your current plan is $69.99 a month. Our Fiber 300 plan would be $89.99. The Fiber 500 would be $119.99, and the Gig plan is $149.99 per month.

Customer: (pause) Wow, that's... that's a pretty big jump from what I'm paying now. Are there any promotions or anything?

Agent: Great question. Actually, yes, we do have a promotion running right now. If you upgrade to Fiber 300 or higher, we can waive your installation fee, which would normally be $99, and we're also offering the first three months at a promotional rate. For the Fiber 500 plan, we could do that for $89.99 for the first three months, then it goes to the regular $119.99 after that.

Customer: Hmm, for Fiber 500?

Agent: Yes, sir. So essentially you'd save about $90 in installation and get that discounted rate for the first quarter.

Customer: Okay, that's... that's more reasonable. What kind of speeds are we talking with the 500?

Agent: So Fiber 500 gives you download speeds up to 500 megabits per second and upload speeds of 100 megabits per second. For a household like yours with multiple users and streaming, that should handle everything pretty comfortably.

Customer: Yeah, I think that would be way better than what I've got now. Can you tell me... like, how long would installation take? And when could you guys get out here?

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely. Installation typically takes about two to three hours. Let me check our availability... (pause) We have some openings this week. Would a Saturday work for you, or do you prefer a weekday?

Customer: A Saturday would be perfect. We've got work and school during the week.

Agent: Perfect. How about this Saturday, the 16th, between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m.?

Customer: That works great.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) I'm going to get that scheduled for you. Just to confirm, I have your address as 447 Maple Drive, unit B. Is that still correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So let me just recap what we've got here. You're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500, which is $89.99 for your first three months, then $119.99 after that. We're waiving the $99 installation fee, and we have a tech scheduled for this Saturday the 16th between 9 a.m. and noon. Your confirmation number is FR-229847, and that'll be sent to your email on file.

Customer: Perfect. And just to make sure, there's no contract or anything, right?

Agent: No, sir. Fiber service is month-to-month. You can stay as long as you like or make changes whenever you need to.

Customer: Awesome. And the speeds... that'll be consistent? Like, it's not going to slow down at certain times?

Agent: Fiber is really great about that. You're going to get those speeds pretty consistently. Of course, it depends a little bit on what devices you're using and how many people are on at once, but yeah, 500 meg should be plenty for your situation.

Customer: Great. I really appreciate your help, Derek.

Agent: My pleasure! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see your tech on Saturday. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
