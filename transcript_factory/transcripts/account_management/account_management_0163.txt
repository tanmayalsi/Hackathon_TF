Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. I'm calling because I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Just to get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this Robert Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So you're looking to upgrade your current service. Can you tell me a little bit about what's not working for you right now? What speeds are you currently on?

Customer: Okay, so right now I'm on the, uh... I think it's the 100 meg plan? And honestly it was fine for a while, but now with my wife working from home and my kids doing online school, it's just... everything's buffering. Video calls are dropping constantly. It's really frustrating.

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally understand. Bandwidth gets eaten up quick with multiple users. Let me pull up your account here. (pause, typing) Okay, I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years on our 100 Mbps fiber plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Perfect. So we actually have some great options for you. With that kind of household usage, I'd recommend either our 300 Mbps or our 500 Mbps plan. The 500 is our most popular upgrade—it handles multiple video streams, working from home, gaming, all of it without any issues.

Customer: (pause) Okay, and what would that run me monthly? Like, what's the difference?

Agent: Great question. So your current plan is $69.99 a month, yeah? The 300 Mbps would bring you to $89.99, and the 500 Mbps is $119.99 per month.

Customer: (slight hesitation) Wow, that's... that's a jump from what I'm paying now.

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate that. But I do have some good news. Because you've been a loyal customer for three years, I can actually apply a promotional discount for you. If you go with the 500 Mbps plan, I can lock in a rate of $99.99 for the first twelve months, and then it goes to the regular rate after that.

Customer: Oh, okay. That's better. And that's just the internet, right? I'm not locked into any contract or anything?

Agent: Correct, that's just the internet service. And no, we don't require contracts at Frontier. You're month-to-month, so you have the flexibility. The promotional rate is guaranteed for twelve months though, and then it will adjust to our standard pricing.

Customer: Alright, and when could this be activated? Like, do I need a technician to come out or anything?

Agent: That's a good question. Since you're already a fiber customer with us, you should be all set. The upgrade is usually just a configuration change on our end, so it can typically be activated within 24 hours. You might see a brief service interruption—maybe 15, 20 minutes—but you won't need a technician visit.

Customer: Oh perfect. That's way easier than I thought it'd be.

Agent: (typing sounds) Awesome. So let me just confirm everything with you. I'm upgrading you from the 100 Mbps fiber plan to the 500 Mbps fiber plan. Your new rate will be $99.99 per month for the first 12 months, and then it adjusts to $119.99 after that. Does that all sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect. When does it take effect?

Agent: So I can process this right now, and the changes will go live within 24 hours. You should see the new speeds available probably by tomorrow morning. I'll also email you a confirmation with all the details and a reference number for your records.

Customer: Great, thank you.

Agent: My pleasure. And just so you know, if you experience any issues once the upgrade goes live, just give us a call back and we'll get you sorted out right away. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that's it. Thanks for making this easy.

Agent: You got it, Robert. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks again.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
