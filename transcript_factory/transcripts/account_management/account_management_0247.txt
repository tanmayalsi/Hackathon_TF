Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet. I think my current speed is... I'm not totally sure, but it's like 100 megabits or something? And it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've actually upgraded our network in a lot of areas recently, so you might have some great options available to you. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing an account here for... is this Michael Chen?

Customer: Yep, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. So I'm looking at your service address on Maple Street, is that still current?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. Okay, so I'm seeing you're currently on our 100 Mbps plan. And you're right, you've been with us since 2021. We really appreciate that loyalty. So what's driving the need for an upgrade today? Are you working from home, or...?

Customer: Actually, yeah. I started working from home full-time about six months ago, and my wife uses the internet too for streaming and stuff. Like, I'll be on a video call and then she'll turn on Netflix and everything just... it gets really slow and glitchy, you know?

Agent: Oh yeah, I hear that a lot, especially with remote work. The 100 Mbps is really more of a baseline plan nowadays. What we'd probably recommend—depending on what's available at your address—is our 400 Mbps or even our 1 Gig service. That would give you plenty of bandwidth for multiple users.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference in price? That's the main thing for me.

Agent: Fair question. So your current plan is... (typing) ...I'm seeing it's $69.99 a month. Our 400 Mbps is $99.99, and our Gig service is $129.99 for the first year, and then it goes to $159.99 after that.

Customer: (pause) Wow, okay. That's... that's a pretty big jump from what I'm paying now.

Agent: I hear you. But let me see what I can do for you here. You know, because you've been such a loyal customer, I might be able to apply a promotional rate. Let me just check what we have available... (typing sounds) Okay, so I can actually offer you the 400 Mbps service at $89.99 a month for the first 12 months, and then it goes to the regular $99.99 after that. How does that sound?

Customer: That's better. Um... is there any way to get closer to the regular price I'm paying now? Like, I was hoping to stay under eighty?

Agent: (pause) You know what, let me be honest with you, Michael—I really can't go much lower than that for the 400 Mbps. But I'll tell you what, if you wanted to stick with the 100 Mbps, I could keep you at your current rate, but then we're not really solving your problem, right?

Customer: Right, right. No, I get it. (pause) You know what, I think the 400 would be good. That should handle both of us.

Agent: Perfect. And honestly, I think you're going to see a huge difference. Most people don't realize how much of a difference 400 gives you. So let me just confirm everything here. I'm going to upgrade you to the 400 Mbps plan at $89.99 for the first year. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Any questions about the service?

Customer: Um, do I need new equipment, or...?

Agent: Great question. So the modem you have now is probably a few years old, right? I'd definitely recommend upgrading to our newer equipment. We have a new Technicolor modem that's going to give you much better performance. That's going to be an additional $15 a month for the equipment.

Customer: (slight groan) So that's—

Agent: I know, I know, it adds up. But you'll rent the equipment rather than buying it, and if anything ever goes wrong with it, we replace it for free. No hassle.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So fifteen more a month?

Agent: Yes, sir. So your total would be $104.99 a month for the first year, and then $114.99 after that, and that includes the new modem and the 400 Mbps service.

Customer: Alright, I'll do it.

Agent: Awesome. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm getting everything set up here. We're going to send you the new modem, and it should arrive within... (pause) ...looks like three to five business days. You can install it yourself—it's really pretty straightforward—or if you want, we can schedule a technician to come out and do it. That's up to you.

Customer: No, I think I can handle it. I've done this before.

Agent: Perfect. And once you get the new modem, just plug it in, and you should see the speed improvement right away. If you have any issues with the installation or anything else, you can always call us back. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Great, thanks Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. So just to recap, your service is going to be upgraded effective tomorrow. You'll see the charge on your next bill. You should receive the modem by... let me see here... by next Friday at the latest. Is there a preferred delivery time, or should we just leave it during business hours?

Customer: Business hours is fine. I'm working from home anyway, so I'll probably be around.

Agent: Perfect. Then we're all set. I really appreciate your business, Michael, and I hope this solves your issues with the internet speed.

Customer: Thanks a lot, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
