# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I currently have the 100 meg plan, but I'm finding it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I can definitely help you with that. I'm glad you reached out. Just to get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. Let me pull that up here. And just to confirm, is this a residential account?

Customer: Yeah, residential. It's at 2847 Maple Drive in Portland.

Agent: (pause) Great, got it. So I'm seeing here you've been with us for about three years on the 100 meg fiber plan. That's fantastic. And you're looking to upgrade to something faster?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. My kids are doing online school now, and my wife and I both work from home most days. So we've got like... (laughs) ...a lot of devices going at once. Video calls, streaming, downloads. The 100 meg just isn't keeping up, you know?

Agent: Oh, I completely understand. That's actually really common, especially with multiple people working and learning from home. So we have a few options available at your address. We can upgrade you to our 300 megabit plan, or if you really want the top tier, we have our 1 gigabit fiber service, which is honestly incredible.

Customer: Okay, so what's the pricing difference on those?

Agent: Great question. So your current plan is at $59.99 a month. The 300 meg would be $89.99 a month, and then the gig plan runs $129.99 a month. But I should mention—and this is important—we do have a promotion running right now. If you commit to a two-year contract, I can get you the 300 meg plan for $79.99 for the first year, then it goes up to the regular price.

Customer: Hmm, okay. And what about the gigabit plan? Is there a promo on that too?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here... (pause) Yes, actually. For the 1 gig plan on a two-year term, I can do $119.99 for your first year, then $129.99 after that. That's a twenty-dollar savings right off the bat.

Customer: That's pretty good. The gig plan would definitely handle everything we're throwing at it, right?

Agent: Absolutely. I mean, a gigabit is 1,000 megabits per second. With what you've described—multiple video calls, streaming, downloads, online schooling—you'd have more than enough bandwidth. Honestly, you'd never hit capacity with a household like yours.

Customer: Yeah, that makes sense. Um, is there an installation fee or anything like that?

Agent: So, installation—normally there is a $99 fee, but with this upgrade promotion, we're waiving that completely. It's free. We'll send one of our technicians out, usually within three to five business days, and they'll make sure everything's set up properly for you.

Customer: Oh, that's perfect. Yeah, let's go with the gig plan then.

Agent: Excellent choice. I think you're going to be really happy with that. (typing sounds) Okay, so let me just verify some information here. We've got your address as 2847 Maple Drive in Portland. Can I confirm the phone number we have on file? It's showing 555-0147?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And who's the account holder's name?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: David, great. Thank you. And just a quick question—do you have a preferred day or time window for the installation? We have morning, afternoon, or all-day availability.

Customer: Um, how about sometime next week? Wednesday or Thursday afternoon would be ideal.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... Okay, so we have Wednesday the 19th in the afternoon. Does between 1 and 5 PM work for you?

Customer: Yeah, Wednesday works great.

Agent: Excellent. So I'm going to set you up with a technician visit on Wednesday, January 19th, between 1 and 5 PM. They'll call you about an hour before they arrive just to confirm. Now, is there anything else I can help clarify about the service or the upgrade?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. How long will the installation take, roughly?

Agent: Usually about an hour to an hour and a half, depending on the setup. Our technician will run the fiber line if needed, get your modem set up, test the speeds, make sure everything's working optimally. And they can answer any questions you have in person too.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good.

Agent: Perfect. So to recap, we're upgrading you from your 100 meg plan to our 1 gigabit fiber service at $119.99 for the first year, then $129.99. No installation fee. Two-year contract. Installation scheduled for Wednesday, January 19th, afternoon window. We'll send you a confirmation email with all the details and a technician will contact you beforehand.

Customer: That all sounds right.

Agent: Great. And David, just one more thing—you should start seeing the speed improvements pretty much immediately after the installation is complete. If you ever have any issues or questions, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you.

Customer: Awesome. Thanks so much, Marcus. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. Enjoy that gigabit internet, and have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Thanks again. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
