Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been with Frontier for about... I think three years now? And I'm really happy with the service, but I've been thinking about upgrading my internet speed.

Agent: That's great to hear! We're happy to have you as a long-time customer. I'd be happy to help you explore upgrade options. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. (pause) Okay, I've got you here. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right. A hundred megs or something?

Agent: Exactly. One hundred megabits per second download speeds. So what's prompting the upgrade today? Are you finding you need more speed for work, streaming, or...?

Customer: Well, honestly, we've got more people working from home now. My wife and I both have remote jobs, and then our teenager is always streaming Netflix or whatever, and it just... sometimes things feel a little sluggish, you know? We're getting some lag during video calls.

Agent: Oh yeah, that's pretty common with multiple users on the same connection. I totally understand. So we have a couple of excellent options for you. We could bump you up to our Fiber 300 plan, which would give you three hundred megs, or if you want even more headroom, we have our Fiber 500 plan.

Customer: Wow, okay. What's... what's the price difference? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (pause) Let me just check your current rate first. (typing sounds) Okay, so you're at $59.99 a month for the Fiber 100. Our Fiber 300 would be $79.99 a month, so that's an additional twenty bucks. And the Fiber 500 is $99.99 a month.

Customer: Hmm. And the speeds... so 300 would be three hundred megs?

Agent: Yes, sir. Three hundred megabits per second download speeds, and that's typically plenty for multiple users working from home and streaming simultaneously. Most of our customers find that sweet spot really works well for them.

Customer: That does sound like it would solve the problem. Is there, like... is there a contract or anything? Or can I upgrade right now?

Agent: Great question. So here's what I can do for you. I can upgrade you to the Fiber 300 plan effective immediately. There's no contract required—you're month-to-month with us. The upgrade would start on your next billing cycle, which looks like it's... (typing sounds) ...the 18th of next month.

Customer: Okay, and my equipment—do I need to get a different modem or router or anything like that?

Agent: That's a really good question. Your current modem should be compatible, but honestly, to get the full benefit of those 300-meg speeds, I'd recommend getting one of our newer Frontier-provided modems. We actually have a special offer right now where we can swap that out for just a one-time fee of $25, or you could purchase your own compatible modem if you prefer.

Customer: What's the one-time fee versus like... if I buy my own, what am I looking at?

Agent: So the $25 is just the swap fee for the device we provide, and then you'd return your old modem to us. If you want to go the third-party route, you're probably looking at anywhere from $100 to $200 for a decent DOCSIS 3.1 compatible modem that'll really maximize those speeds.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think the $25 option makes more sense. Let's go with that.

Agent: Perfect! So I'm going to get that scheduled for you. We can get a technician out to swap that modem, typically within 3 to 5 business days. Does a morning or afternoon window work better for you?

Customer: Uh, probably afternoon would be better. We're pretty busy in the mornings.

Agent: (typing sounds) Excellent. I'm going to put you down for an afternoon appointment. I'll get a confirmation email sent to you shortly with all the details—your appointment window, the technician's phone number in case they need to reach you, and all the details about your upgrade.

Customer: Awesome. That's really helpful, Marcus. I appreciate it.

Agent: My pleasure! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. This should help with our internet speed issues.

Agent: Wonderful. I'm confident this upgrade is going to make a big difference for you and your family. Thank you so much for being a loyal Frontier customer, and if you ever have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to give us a call back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
