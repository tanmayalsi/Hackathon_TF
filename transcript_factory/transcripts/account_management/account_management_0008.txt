Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, so I've been a customer with you guys for about three years now, and I'm thinking it might be time to upgrade my internet plan.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment here... Perfect, I've got you pulled up. I see you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. It was fine for a while, but lately, I've been working from home more, and my partner streams a lot of Netflix, and honestly, it's just been getting slow. We've been getting some lag.

Agent: I totally understand. With multiple people using the internet at the same time, a hundred megs can definitely get stretched thin. How many devices are typically connected at once in your household?

Customer: Oh, probably... I'd say like five or six? We've got our laptops, phones, and then there's like a smart TV, maybe a Nest camera...

Agent: That definitely adds up. So what kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you interested in our Fiber 200 plan, or would you want to go even higher?

Customer: Um, what's the difference between those? I'm not really super technical, so... (pause) I mean, like, what would actually make a difference for us?

Agent: Great question. So our Fiber 200 is double your current speed—200 megabits per second—which would be perfect for households with multiple users streaming and working simultaneously. If you want to really future-proof yourself, we also offer Fiber 500, which is, as the name suggests, 500 megs per second.

Customer: Wow, okay. That seems like... a lot. Would I need new equipment for that, or...?

Agent: Good news—you'd need a router upgrade, which we can provide. The equipment is actually included at no additional cost. We'd schedule a technician to come out and install it, which usually takes about an hour or so.

Customer: Oh, okay. When could that happen? I work from home on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so I'd need it on like a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... (pause) Looks like we have some openings next week. We could do Monday the 16th in the morning, between 8 and 10 AM, or Wednesday the 18th in the afternoon, between 1 and 3 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: Monday morning would be perfect, actually.

Agent: Excellent. I've got that scheduled for Monday, January 16th, between 8 and 10 AM. Now, let me go over the pricing. Your current plan is $49.99 a month, plus taxes and fees. For the Fiber 200 plan, we're running a promotion right now—first year is $69.99 a month, and then it goes to $79.99 after that.

Customer: Oh, so it's like an introductory rate?

Agent: Exactly. After the first twelve months, it adjusts to our standard rate. Of course, you can always call us back if you want to discuss other options or promotions at that time.

Customer: Hmm, okay. And with the Fiber 500, what's that going to run me?

Agent: For Fiber 500, we have it at $99.99 for the first year, and then $109.99 after that. (pause) I know that's a jump, but honestly, for your situation with multiple users, you might find the extra speed worth it. Plus, with remote work and streaming, you're not gonna have any bottlenecks.

Customer: Yeah, that's true. I mean, the extra thirty bucks a month... (trails off) Actually, you know what, let's go with the 500. I'd rather not have to upgrade again in six months, you know?

Agent: I think that's a smart choice. Okay, so I'm going to update your account to Fiber 500. The installation is still scheduled for Monday morning, and your new rate will be $99.99 per month for the first year. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Oh wait—will my internet go down during the installation?

Agent: That's a good question. The technician will schedule a brief window, maybe five to ten minutes, where we'll need to cut over to the new equipment. I'd recommend letting your employer know if you're taking calls that day, just to be safe.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. Alright, I think we're good.

Agent: Perfect. Just to confirm everything—we're upgrading you to Fiber 500, installation scheduled for Monday, January 16th between 8 and 10 AM, and your rate is $99.99 monthly for the first year. We'll email you a confirmation with the technician details, and they'll also contact you the day before to confirm arrival time.

Customer: Great, thank you!

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: Nope, that's it. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
