# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm just... I'm getting pretty frustrated with my current speeds. I'm paying for the 300 meg plan, but I'm barely getting half that most of the time.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your service history here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing you're on our Fiber 300 plan in the Arlington area. And I appreciate you bringing this up. Have you run any speed tests recently?

Customer: Yeah, I actually did one last night. I got like 170 down, 15 up. It's just... it's been like this for weeks now.

Agent: Hmm, okay. Well, the good news is that we can definitely look into what's going on there. But actually, this might be the perfect opportunity to talk about an upgrade. We just rolled out our Fiber Gig service in your area, and I'm looking at your location, and you're actually eligible for it. That's 1 gigabit download speeds.

Customer: Really? That's available in my area? I didn't even know you guys had that.

Agent: Yeah, it's pretty new. We're expanding it neighborhood by neighborhood. You're in one of the lucky areas. (pause) So with the Gig service, you'd get symmetrical speeds—that's one gig up and one gig down. That's great if you've got a lot of people streaming, working from home, or gaming.

Customer: Okay, that sounds... that sounds really good actually. How much more is that going to run me?

Agent: Great question. So right now we're running a promotional offer. You'd go from your current $79.99 a month to $99.99 for the first year. After that, it goes to $119.99. (typing sounds) But I'm also seeing that I can apply a loyalty credit here, so let me adjust that. (pause) I can get you down to $89.99 for the first twelve months. How does that sound?

Customer: So that's $10 more a month for the first year? That's... that's actually pretty reasonable.

Agent: Exactly. And honestly, with the speeds you'll be getting, it's a pretty good value. Plus, you won't have those slowdown issues anymore—at least not from our network side. Are you still using the router we sent you three years ago?

Customer: Um, yeah, the white one, right? Is that... is that not going to work?

Agent: (pause) Well, it might work, but it honestly won't take full advantage of those gigabit speeds. What I'd recommend is we send you one of our new mesh Wi-Fi systems. It's about $15 a month, but it really transforms your network experience. It gives you better coverage throughout your whole home, and it's specifically designed for these speeds.

Customer: Do I have to get that?

Agent: No, you don't have to. It's totally optional. But I will say, a lot of our Gig customers end up getting it because they notice a big difference, especially if you're in a larger home or have a lot of devices. We do have a thirty-day trial period, so you can try it out first if you want.

Customer: Okay, I'll think about that. Let me just make sure I'm clear on the upgrade itself. So I'm going from 300 megs to a gig, my bill goes up $10 a month with the loyalty discount, and I get the new speeds right away?

Agent: Perfect summary. And there's one more thing—we would need to do a technician visit to upgrade your equipment and make sure everything's set up properly for the gig speeds. I can schedule that for you today, actually. How's your availability looking? We typically have appointments available within the next five to seven business days.

Customer: Um... is there any way to do it sooner? I've got a work thing happening next week, and I'd really like to have this set up before that.

Agent: Let me check. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so we do have a next-day appointment available tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning? Yeah, that actually works. I can be home.

Agent: Awesome. (typing sounds) So I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, between 8 and noon. The technician will probably be there around 9 or so, but I'd recommend being available the whole window just in case. The visit should take about an hour to an hour and a half.

Customer: Okay, great. And I don't need to do anything to prepare, right?

Agent: Nope, just be home and maybe have your current modem and router accessible. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I'm pretty excited about these speeds, to be honest.

Agent: That's awesome. Well, just to recap, your new Frontier Fiber Gig service starts tomorrow. Your bill will be $89.99 monthly for the first year, then $119.99 after that, unless we have additional offers. You'll receive an email confirmation of your appointment within the next few minutes. If you need to reschedule for any reason, just call us back or use the number in that email.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks, Marcus, I appreciate your help.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your loyalty over the past three years. If you have any questions before tomorrow, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
