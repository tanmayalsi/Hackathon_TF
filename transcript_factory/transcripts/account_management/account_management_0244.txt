Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I currently have the... I think it's like the 100 meg plan? And it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I completely understand. We've got some great options available. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for your home service in Denver?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. We're on South Gaylord.

Agent: (pause) Okay, great, I'm seeing your account here. So you're currently on our 100 Mbps fiber plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Honestly, we've got like four people working from home now, and we're doing a lot of video calls, uploading files to the cloud, and the speeds just... they keep buffering. It's frustrating.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, I hear that all the time, especially since, you know, remote work is so common now. The good news is that with four people on the network doing bandwidth-heavy stuff, you're definitely a candidate for a faster tier. We actually have some really solid options. Have you heard about our Gig-speed fiber plans?

Customer: Gig-speed? Like a gigabyte?

Agent: Exactly! A gigabit, so one thousand megabits per second. It's a huge jump from where you are now. We also have some mid-range options if you want something between what you have and the gig plan—like our 300 and 500 Mbps tiers.

Customer: That Gig-speed sounds... that sounds like a lot. Would we even notice the difference? Like, is it worth it?

Agent: (pause) Well, that really depends on your usage. Since you've got four people potentially on the network at the same time doing video calls and file uploads, I'd honestly recommend at least the 500 Mbps plan. That would give you plenty of headroom for everyone. The gig plan is more if you're planning ahead or if you have like heavy gamers or people streaming in 4K.

Customer: Okay, okay. What's the pricing like on the 500?

Agent: (typing sounds) So our 500 Mbps fiber plan is currently $79.99 a month for the first year with a promotional rate, then it goes to our standard rate of $99.99 after that. And that includes the fiber modem at no extra charge.

Customer: And how's that compared to what I'm paying now?

Agent: Let me just check your current rate here. (pause, typing sounds) It looks like you're at $59.99 for the 100 Mbps plan?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: So you'd be looking at about a twenty dollar increase in the first year. But honestly, for the speed increase and what you're dealing with, most of my customers say it's totally worth it. Plus, if you stay with us for two years, we can lock in that promotional rate for the duration.

Customer: Hmm, that's not bad. What about installation? Do you guys have to come out?

Agent: Great question. So since you're already a fiber customer, the upgrade is usually pretty straightforward. We can often do it remotely or with a quick technician visit. The technician would just need to come swap out your modem and potentially adjust some settings at the pole. It typically takes about 30 minutes to an hour. We can schedule that at your convenience.

Customer: And when could that happen?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let's see what we have available. Would you prefer a weekday or weekend?

Customer: Um, weekday would probably be easier, actually. Maybe next week sometime?

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing we have availability on Wednesday, June 14th between 8 AM and 10 AM, or Thursday afternoon between 2 and 4 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Wednesday morning would be great.

Agent: Excellent! I'll get you scheduled for Wednesday the 14th, 8 to 10 AM. (typing sounds) Now, let me just go over everything to make sure we're on the same page. We're upgrading you from your 100 Mbps plan to our 500 Mbps fiber plan at $79.99 monthly for the first year, then $99.99 after. Installation is scheduled for Wednesday, June 14th, morning. There will be no equipment fees. Is all of that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Um, one more thing—is there anything I need to do to prepare, or will the technician just handle everything?

Agent: (pause) Great question. Honestly, there's not much you need to do. Just make sure someone's home for the appointment window, and if you have any devices that are hardwired into your current modem, you might want to have those information handy. But really, our tech will take care of most of it. They'll handle the swap and make sure everything's working before they leave.

Customer: Perfect. I think that's all I need to know.

Agent: Awesome! So just to confirm one more time, I'm going to send you a confirmation email and a text message with your appointment details and your new billing information. Is the best number to reach you the one I have on file?

Customer: Yeah, 555-0147 is fine.

Agent: Perfect. And your email on file is [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Actually, it's [inaudible]@outlook.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Ah, got it, thank you for catching that. I've updated that. You should see everything in the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help, Marcus!

Agent: My pleasure! Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and I hope the faster speeds really improve things for you and your family. We really appreciate your business, and if you have any issues before your installation, just give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!
