# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I've been a customer for about... I think three years now? And I'm thinking it might be time to upgrade my internet. My speeds have been okay, but I'm working from home more these days and it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. More people are working remotely now, so faster speeds definitely help with that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your phone number or account number to look that up?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. I'm seeing here you're on our 100 megabit plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. I think that's what I signed up for when I first got the service.

Agent: Perfect. And just out of curiosity, what kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you streaming, doing video calls, that sort of thing?

Customer: Yeah, lots of video meetings throughout the day. I've got like four or five people in my household too, so my wife's working from home, my kids are doing school stuff online... and my son likes to game, so...

Agent: Oh man, okay, yeah. With that kind of activity, 100 megs is definitely going to feel slow. (pause) So we've got a couple of options for you. We have our 300 megabit fiber plan, which is what I'd recommend for a situation like yours, and then we also have our gigabit plan—that's 1000 megs—if you want to really future-proof yourself.

Customer: How much more would that be? Like, compared to what I'm paying now?

Agent: (typing sounds) So you're currently at $59.99 a month. The 300 meg plan is $79.99, so that's about a $20 increase. And the gig plan is $99.99 per month.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Is that a promotional rate, or is that what it would be forever?

Agent: Great question. So with both of those plans, we do have a promotional period. The 300 meg is $79.99 for the first 12 months, and then it would go to $89.99 after that. The gigabit plan is $99.99 for 24 months, and then it would be $109.99.

Customer: Okay, okay. I mean, the 300 should probably work for us, right? With the kids' school stuff and the video calls?

Agent: Absolutely. The 300 meg plan is solid for that scenario. That'll give each person in your household plenty of bandwidth to work with. You won't have to worry about things slowing down when multiple people are online.

Customer: Yeah, that makes sense. And I don't need a technician to come out or anything like that, right? I mean, I'm already set up with fiber to my house.

Agent: (pause) Let me just double-check here... (typing sounds) You know what, you're in a great spot. Since you're already on our fiber network, we can actually push that upgrade remotely. You won't need a tech visit. We'll just make some adjustments on our end, and you should see the change pretty much immediately.

Customer: Oh nice! That's way easier. When can that happen?

Agent: We can get you set up today, actually. How soon would you like to make the switch? We can do it right now if you'd like, or we can schedule it for a specific time that works better for you.

Customer: Today works. I mean, as long as it won't affect anything, like, mid-afternoon or something? I've got a meeting at 2 PM that I really can't miss.

Agent: Perfect. How about we do it at 3 PM? That should give you plenty of buffer time after your meeting.

Customer: Yeah, 3 PM is good.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I've got that scheduled for 3 PM today. The upgrade process takes about 15 to 20 minutes, so just keep that in mind. You might see your connection drop briefly during that time, but it'll come back stronger and faster. (pause) So just to confirm everything—we're upgrading you from the 100 meg plan to the 300 meg plan at $79.99 per month for the first year. Is all of that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. And I'll see the faster speeds right away once it's done?

Agent: You sure will. You'll notice a pretty significant difference, especially when you're running multiple video calls and streaming at the same time. (pause) Okay, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Oh wait—do I need to do anything on my end? Like, do I need to restart anything or...?

Agent: You know, that's a good instinct, but you shouldn't need to do anything. We'll handle it all from our end. The only thing—just make sure you're not downloading anything huge or in the middle of something important right when we start the upgrade, just in case.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. Thanks so much for this.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for being a Frontier customer. You should receive a confirmation email shortly, and you'll get another notification right before we start the upgrade at 3 PM. If you have any issues after the upgrade, just give us a call back and we'll take care of it.

Customer: Appreciate it. Have a good one.

Agent: You too! Thanks for calling Frontier.
