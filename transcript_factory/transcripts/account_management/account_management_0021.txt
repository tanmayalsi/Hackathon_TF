Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've got the 100 meg plan right now, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to verify, is this still at 2847 Maple Street in Springfield?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you're currently on our Gig 100 plan. Can I ask what's been prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, or just experiencing slower speeds?

Customer: Yeah, both actually. I started working from home about six months ago, and my partner streams a lot. We've got multiple devices going at once, and it's just... like, everything buffers constantly. Plus my video calls keep dropping, which is really not ideal when you're on client calls, you know?

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. That's frustrating. (pause) So with multiple users and streaming, you'd definitely benefit from a higher tier. We currently have two options that would work well for your situation. We have the Gig 200 at 200 megabits per second, or if you want maximum performance, there's our Gig 500 at 500 megabits per second.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference in price? I'm on... I think it's like $79 a month right now?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, you're at $79.99 with a promotional rate. That's set to expire in about four months, by the way. For the Gig 200, we'd move you to $99.99 per month, so that's $20 more. And the Gig 500 would be $129.99.

Customer: Hmm. Is that introductory pricing or is that the regular rate?

Agent: Good question. The Gig 200 would be $99.99 for the first 12 months, and then it would go to $119.99 after that. For the Gig 500, it's $129.99 for 12 months, then $149.99.

Customer: Okay, so... (pause) what would you recommend? Between the 200 and the 500?

Agent: Well, it really depends on your usage. For two people working and streaming simultaneously, the Gig 200 would be solid—that's plenty of bandwidth for video conferencing, multiple streams, and general browsing. The Gig 500 is really if you're doing a lot of 4K streaming, gaming, or if you have more than two or three heavy users at once. But honestly, based on what you described, I think the 200 would handle your situation really well.

Customer: And I can upgrade right now without any issues? I don't have to reschedule or anything?

Agent: Actually, that's the best part. Since you're already in our network and have our equipment, this would be a simple plan change. There's no technician visit required. The upgrade would take effect within the next 24 hours, usually much faster.

Customer: Oh nice, that's easy. Okay, let's go with the Gig 200 then.

Agent: Excellent choice. (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm going to update your account now. Just to confirm—you want to upgrade from Gig 100 to Gig 200 at $99.99 per month for the first 12 months?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you're aware, your current promotional rate will end in about four months anyway, so this is actually a good move. You'll notice the speed improvement pretty much immediately. (pause) Okay, I'm processing that now... and... there we go. You're all set!

Customer: That was fast!

Agent: We aim to make it easy. (chuckles) So your new plan is active as of now. You should see the speed increase within a few hours. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Do I need to do anything on my end?

Agent: Nope, nothing at all. Your modem will automatically adjust. If for some reason you don't see the improvement by tomorrow, you can always give us a call back and we can run a speed test together. But you should be good to go.

Customer: Great, thank you so much. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye!

Agent: Bye!
