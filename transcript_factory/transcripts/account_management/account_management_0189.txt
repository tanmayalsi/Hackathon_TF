Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. One moment... Alright, I'm seeing an account under the name Jennifer Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned you're looking to upgrade your current service. I'm seeing here that you're on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that still your current speed?

Customer: Yeah, the hundred megabits per second. And honestly, it's been fine for a while, but I'm working from home now, and my spouse also works from home, so we're both on video calls a lot and... it's just getting slower, you know? Plus we're streaming stuff, so it's just not enough anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. With two people working from home and streaming, you're definitely going to want more bandwidth. How many devices would you say you have connected at any given time?

Customer: Um... probably like six or seven? We have two laptops for work, two phones, a tablet, a smart TV... oh, and a Ring camera.

Agent: Yeah, that'll definitely add up. So what kind of speeds are you thinking? Are you looking to double down, or do you want to go even higher?

Customer: I'm not really sure. What do you recommend?

Agent: Well, for your situation, I'd say our Fiber 300 plan would be a great fit. That's three hundred megabits per second, and it's ideal for households with multiple people working from home and heavy streaming. We also have Fiber 500, which is five hundred megs, but honestly, unless you're doing a lot of 4K streaming or gaming, the 300 should be more than plenty.

Customer: Okay, and what would the price be? Like, how much more than what I'm paying now?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check your current rate... So you're paying $59.99 a month for the 100 plan. Our Fiber 300 would be $89.99 a month.

Customer: Oh... that's like thirty dollars more, huh?

Agent: Yeah, it's an increase, but you're getting three times the speed. And actually, since you're a loyal customer—let me see what I can do here—(pause) I might be able to get you a promotional rate. If you commit to a two-year service agreement, I can get you $79.99 for the first year on the Fiber 300 plan.

Customer: Really? That's better. What happens after the first year?

Agent: After year one, it would go to the regular price of $89.99. But you'd have the flexibility to upgrade, downgrade, or make changes after that first year if you wanted to.

Customer: And there's no installation fee or anything like that?

Agent: Well, since you're already a Frontier customer with existing fiber service at your location, we wouldn't need to do any new fiber installation. However, there would be a service change fee of $99, but I can actually waive that for you since you're upgrading your service.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. That's nice of you. (pause) How soon can you switch me over?

Agent: Great question. We can process this upgrade right now, and we can have the service activated as early as tomorrow, or I can schedule it for a time that works better for you. What works best?

Customer: Tomorrow would be perfect, actually. The sooner the better.

Agent: Excellent. And just to confirm, the service change would take maybe fifteen to twenty minutes, and you shouldn't experience any downtime. You might want to restart your router after the change goes through, just to make sure everything syncs up properly.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I can do that. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Not on your end. We'll handle everything from here. You'll receive a confirmation email at the address we have on file, which is... (typing) ...jmartinez.94@email.com, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And just to recap, I'm upgrading your service from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, effective tomorrow. Your first year rate will be $79.99 per month, and I've waived the service change fee. The service agreement is for two years.

Customer: That all sounds good.

Agent: Wonderful. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you so much for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and welcome to Fiber 300. You're going to really notice the difference. If you have any issues after the upgrade tomorrow, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you right away.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Have a great day!
