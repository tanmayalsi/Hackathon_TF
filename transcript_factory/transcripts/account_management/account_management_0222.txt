Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I've been a customer for about three years now and my internet has been pretty good, but I'm thinking I might need to upgrade. My current plan is getting a little slow for what we're doing at home.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me just pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm looking at your account now. I can see you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right. I mean, 100 megabits, I think that's what they told me when I signed up.

Agent: Exactly. So what kind of activities are you finding that the speed isn't keeping up with? That'll help me recommend the right plan for you.

Customer: Well, my wife works from home now, so she's on video calls a lot. And I've got two kids who are constantly streaming stuff—Netflix, YouTube, all that. And then I'm trying to work from home too, but like, if everyone's using it at the same time, things just kind of... bog down, you know?

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally get that. That's actually a pretty common issue we hear about, especially with multiple people in the household. With video conferencing, streaming, and regular browsing all happening simultaneously, 100 megs can definitely get stretched thin. (pause) So I'm looking at what we have available at your location. You'd be a great candidate for our Fiber 300 plan. That would give you plenty of headroom for everything you're doing.

Customer: Okay, so that's... three times faster?

Agent: Exactly right. And honestly, it's not just about raw speed—the consistency is really there too. You'll notice a huge difference in those situations where multiple people are using the internet at once. Video calls will be crystal clear, streaming won't buffer, and you'll have that capacity for everything else.

Customer: That sounds good. Um, what's the price difference? I'm on... I'm not sure what I'm paying now, actually.

Agent: (typing sounds) So you're currently on Fiber 100, and your bill is $59.99 a month. The Fiber 300 would be $79.99 a month, so that's a twenty dollar increase.

Customer: (pause) Twenty bucks more...

Agent: I know that's something to consider. But I should mention—we actually have a promotional rate available right now. I can get you set up at $69.99 for the first twelve months. After that, it goes to the standard rate, but you'd lock in that price for the year.

Customer: Really? Okay, so for the first year it's only ten dollars more?

Agent: That's right. And if you're not happy with it, you could always adjust down, but I really don't think you will be. Once you experience that speed difference, you won't want to go back. (chuckles)

Customer: (laughs) Yeah, I hear you. Alright, let's do it. When would it take effect?

Agent: Great choice! So the upgrade would take effect on your next billing cycle. When does your next billing cycle start?

Customer: Um... I think it's like the 15th? Or maybe the first? I'm not... [inaudible].

Agent: (typing sounds) Your next cycle is actually the 8th of next month. So if I process this today, we'll go ahead and schedule the upgrade for then. That'll give us a few days to make sure everything on our end is set up properly. You shouldn't experience any downtime at all—it's just a configuration change on the network.

Customer: Oh, that's perfect. So I don't have to do anything? You guys handle it all?

Agent: That's exactly right. We handle everything remotely. You just wake up on the 8th with faster internet. (laughs) The only thing I'd recommend is maybe restarting your router that morning just to make sure it picks up the new configuration cleanly, but that's totally optional.

Customer: Easy enough. Is there anything else I should know about?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me just make sure... No, I think you're all set. You'll get a confirmation email to [inaudible]@yahoo.com that has all the details of your upgrade. Is that still the correct email?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm everything—you're upgrading from our Fiber 100 plan to Fiber 300, promotional rate of $69.99 per month for the first twelve months, effective on your next billing cycle on the 8th of next month. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect. Thank you so much.

Agent: You're very welcome! I'm glad we could get you set up with something that'll work better for your household. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier! Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
