# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Derek. Um, I'm calling because I'm looking to upgrade my internet. I currently have the 100 meg plan and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. A lot of our customers find themselves in that situation. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: Yeah, it's area code 503, 555... uh, let me think... 0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And can I verify the service address for you?

Customer: Yeah, it's 2341 Birch Street, Portland.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account now. I see you've been with us for about three years on that 100 Mbps plan. What's prompting the upgrade? Just more bandwidth needed, or...?

Customer: Well, my wife started working from home, and we've got... I don't know, probably like five or six devices streaming at any given time. The internet's been dropping out, it's buffering constantly. We're paying for 100 megs but I swear we're only getting like 40 on a good day. It's driving us nuts.

Agent: Yeah, that would definitely be frustrating. (pause) So before we talk about upgrades, are you using the modem we provided, or do you have your own equipment?

Customer: Oh, it's the one you guys gave us. The... I don't know, the white box thing? It's gotta be a few years old at this point.

Agent: That could actually be part of the issue right there. We can definitely upgrade that for free when you upgrade your service. So, let me ask you this—what speeds are you looking at? We've got 300 Mbps, 500 Mbps, and then our gig plan at 940 Mbps.

Customer: (laughs) A gig? That seems like overkill. What's the price difference on those?

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, so your current plan is... looks like you're at $49.99 a month. For the 300 Meg plan, we can get you in at $59.99. That's a $10 bump. The 500 is $79.99, and the gig plan is $99.99.

Customer: Hmm, and that's like... that doesn't go up after a year or anything?

Agent: (brief pause) So, I want to be completely transparent with you. That pricing I just gave you is good for twelve months, and then it would adjust to our standard rate. But here's the thing—we have a promo running right now where if you bundle with TV, I can lock you in at those rates for twenty-four months.

Customer: We don't really watch much TV though. I mean, we've got streaming services...

Agent: I hear you. Um, actually, let me see what else I can do here. (typing sounds) You know what, because you've been a loyal customer for three years, I can actually apply a loyalty credit that'll knock fifteen bucks off your first year, regardless of which plan you choose. So the 300 would effectively be $44.99 after that credit.

Customer: Oh, okay! So that's actually cheaper than what I'm paying now?

Agent: Exactly. You'd get the speed upgrade, the newer modem, and you'd actually be paying less your first year.

Customer: (pause) That's not bad. Uh, do you think the 300 would be enough? Like, realistically?

Agent: For what you're describing—work from home, multiple streaming devices, that kind of thing—300 should handle that pretty comfortably. You'd be in really good shape. If you ever find you need more down the road, upgrading is super easy.

Customer: Alright, I think the 300 makes sense then.

Agent: Great choice. (typing sounds) So I'm gonna get you set up here. The new modem can be shipped to you, or we have an option to have a technician bring it out and install it. With the install, there's a $99 one-time fee, but they'll make sure everything's running perfectly. Without the tech visit, it ships free and typically arrives in five to seven business days.

Customer: Yeah, I'll do the technician. I'm not super tech-savvy, and I want to make sure it's done right, you know?

Agent: Smart move. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm setting up a technician appointment for you. What days work best for you? We have availability this Saturday between 8 AM and 12 PM, or next Tuesday between 1 and 5 PM?

Customer: This Saturday works. We'll be home.

Agent: Perfect. Saturday it is. (typing sounds) I'm scheduling that for you right now. The technician will arrive with the new modem and equipment, hook everything up, test the speeds, and make sure you're all good to go. The window is 8 AM to noon, and you should expect someone around that timeframe. There'll be a courtesy call about thirty minutes before they arrive.

Customer: Got it. And when does this new rate go into effect?

Agent: Your new plan and the pricing will be active starting with your next billing cycle, which looks like... the 15th of next month. So you'll have about two weeks at your current rate, then it'll switch over.

Customer: Cool. Anything else I need to know?

Agent: (pause) Just a couple of quick things. Make sure you have easy access to where your modem is currently set up so the tech can get in there on Saturday. And, um, you'll be getting a confirmation email shortly with all the details of your appointment. If for any reason you need to reschedule, just give us a call back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I'm pretty excited about getting that speed boost, honestly.

Agent: (laughs) You're gonna feel the difference right away, trust me. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
