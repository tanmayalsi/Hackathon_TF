Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I currently have the 100 megabit plan, and I'm finding it's just not quite cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've definitely seen more customers needing faster speeds, especially with everything going on these days. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our 100 Mbps Fiber plan. How long have you been with us?

Customer: Oh, about three years now, I think? Maybe a little longer. I've been pretty happy with the service overall, but my kids are doing school from home, and with my wife working remotely too, we're running into bandwidth issues. Streaming cuts out, video calls lag... it's frustrating.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. Multiple devices streaming simultaneously can really max out a 100 Mbps connection. We actually have some great options for you. Our most popular upgrade right now is the 400 Mbps plan. That gives you plenty of headroom for multiple simultaneous activities.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I've heard about that. What's the pricing on that?

Agent: (pause) So right now, for new upgrades, we're offering the 400 Mbps plan at $79.99 a month for the first twelve months. After that, it would be $99.99 a month. That's our standard rate. But because you've been a loyal customer for three years, I can actually apply a retention discount that brings it down to $89.99 for the first year, and then $94.99 after that.

Customer: Hmm, that's a difference of ten bucks, which... okay, that's something. What about installation? Would you need to send someone out?

Agent: That's a great question. Since you already have Fiber to your home, we actually won't need a technician visit for this upgrade. We can just push the service upgrade remotely, so there's zero installation fee. You'd be good to go same day, or we can schedule it for a specific time if you prefer.

Customer: Oh, that's convenient. And the speed will just be faster on the same line I have now?

Agent: Exactly. Same fiber line, just upgraded bandwidth. You'll keep the same modem and router you have now—they're already capable of handling the faster speeds.

Customer: Great. And just to clarify, is that $89.99locked in for the full year, or is there any... you know, hidden stuff that pops up?

Agent: (pause) No hidden fees. That $89.99 is your promotional rate for twelve months from the date of upgrade. It covers your internet service. After twelve months, it will adjust to the standard rate of $94.99. But look, when that time comes around, you can always give us a call back, and we usually have other promotions running. Most of our long-term customers end up renegotiating their rate.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate the honesty about that. Um, can I ask—do you have anything faster than 400?

Agent: We do, actually. We offer a gig service—that's 1,000 Mbps. That one's a bit more premium. It's $129.99 a month for the first year with your loyalty discount, and then $149.99 after. But honestly, for most households with a few people streaming and working from home, the 400 is plenty. The gig is more for people who are running small businesses from home or have really heavy usage.

Customer: Yeah, I don't think I need to go that far. The 400 sounds like it'll do the job. Can we go ahead and set that up?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to get that processed for you right now. (typing sounds) Let me just confirm a few details. Your current address is 428 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And I'm going to set this upgrade to take effect tomorrow at midnight. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's fast. (laughs) Yeah, that works great.

Agent: Wonderful. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to email you a confirmation with all the details—the new rate, the effective date, and your service terms. You should receive that within the next few minutes. Is the email on file still [inaudible]?

Customer: Um, hold on, let me think... yes, I think it's still jessica.martinez.1988@email.com.

Agent: Great. I'll send it to that address. And just so you know, you don't need to do anything on your end. The upgrade will be automatic. You might notice your speeds improve right after midnight tomorrow, but just to be safe, you could restart your modem in the morning if you want to ensure you're getting the full speeds.

Customer: Okay, I'll do that. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: (pause) No, I think we're all set. You're going to see a really noticeable difference once you're on the 400 Mbps plan. I'm confident that'll solve the issues you've been experiencing with the bandwidth. And hey, if you ever need anything else or have questions, you can always call us back or check your online account portal.

Customer: Perfect. I really appreciate you walking me through all this, Marcus. This was painless.

Agent: My pleasure! It was great helping you out today. Is there anything else I can assist you with before I let you go?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Wonderful. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and enjoy that faster internet!

Customer: Will do. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications!
