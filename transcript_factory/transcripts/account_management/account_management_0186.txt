Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've had Frontier for about two years now, and I'm pretty happy with the service, but I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan is... I think it's the 500 meg?

Agent: That's great to hear! I'm glad you've had a good experience with us. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Okay, I'm seeing an account here under... is this Jennifer Martinez?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect! So I'm looking at your account now, and yes, you're currently on our Gigabit 500 plan. That's our mid-tier offering. What kind of speeds were you looking to upgrade to? Are you experiencing any issues with your current speed, or is this more of a proactive upgrade?

Customer: No, no, everything's been working great. It's more... well, my son moved back home, and now we've got like four or five people streaming and gaming at the same time, and I've noticed things are getting a little sluggish. Plus, my husband works from home now, and he does a lot of video calls for his job.

Agent: Ah, okay, that makes total sense. So you're hitting some congestion with multiple users. I totally get that. So we have a couple of options for you. We offer our Gigabit 1 Gig plan, which is our fastest residential option at one gigabit per second download speeds. That's gonna be significantly faster than what you're on now. We also have a Gigabit 2 Gig plan for customers who really need that top-tier speed.

Customer: Wow, okay. Um, what's the price difference? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: I hear you. (typing) So your current plan, the 500 meg, I'm showing you're at $64.99 a month. If you upgrade to the Gigabit 1 Gig plan, that would be $89.99 a month. So that's an increase of about $25 a month.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. That's... that's a decent bump. And with that, would everything run smoothly with all of us using it at the same time?

Agent: Oh absolutely. One gigabit per second is... I mean, that's ten times faster than what you're on now. So you'd have plenty of bandwidth for everyone to stream, game, and video call simultaneously without any issues. In fact, you'd still have headroom left over. Most households with that kind of usage, the 1 Gig is really the sweet spot. Unless you're running a server or something out of your home, the 2 Gig is... (pause) ...it's probably overkill for most people.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. And I wouldn't have to change my router or anything, right? I mean, I have the one Frontier gave me...

Agent: Great question. So the router you have now, the Quantum Gateway, it actually already supports gigabit speeds. However, I would recommend upgrading to our newer model, the Quantum Gateway Pro, just because it has better Wi-Fi 6 capabilities, and with multiple people using the network, you'll get more consistent speeds throughout your home. That's an additional $15 a month with the upgrade.

Customer: Okay, so that would bring it to $105 a month?

Agent: Exactly right. And that's for the 1 Gig plan plus the Gateway Pro. Now, I should mention we also have a promotion running right now where if you upgrade, we waive the first month's router rental fee. So your first month would be $89.99, and then it would go to $104.99 starting month two.

Customer: (pause) That's still... I mean, that's basically $105 a month after the first month. Can you do anything on the price, or is that pretty much...?

Agent: That's a fair question. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) So I can offer you a loyalty credit of $10 a month for the first year since you've been a good customer with us for two years. That would bring it down to $94.99 a month going forward. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh, that's better! Yeah, okay, that works for me. When could that be switched over?

Agent: So we can actually get that scheduled for you pretty quickly. We'd need to send a technician out to swap out your gateway for the new model and make sure everything's configured properly. I'm looking at our availability... (typing) ...and it looks like we have an opening tomorrow between 12 and 4 p.m., or we have a few slots later in the week on Thursday and Friday. What works best for you?

Customer: Tomorrow would be great, actually. That's perfect.

Agent: Perfect! So I'm going to schedule a technician visit for tomorrow between noon and 4 p.m. The technician will bring the new Quantum Gateway Pro, install it for you, and test all the connections. The visit is complimentary with your upgrade. You should receive a confirmation email within the next 30 minutes with all the details and a link where you can narrow down the time window if you want.

Customer: Great. Do I need to do anything to prepare or...?

Agent: Not really. Just make sure someone's home to let the technician in. They'll handle everything else. They might ask you to do a quick speed test after they're done just to confirm everything's working as it should, but that's it.

Customer: Okay, perfect. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: I don't think so. Just to recap, your service will upgrade from Gigabit 500 to Gigabit 1 Gig tomorrow, you'll get the new router installed, and you'll have that $10 loyalty credit bringing your monthly bill to $94.99. Your upgrade takes effect tomorrow upon installation.

Customer: Sounds good. Thank you so much, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer! I really appreciate you choosing to stay with Frontier and upgrade your service. If you have any questions before the technician arrives, just give us a call back. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again!

Agent: Have a great day, and thank you for being a Frontier customer!

Customer: Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
