# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I've had your internet service for about three years now, and I'm thinking it might be time to upgrade. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you explore upgrade options. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Frontier 50 plan with download speeds of 50 megabits per second. Is that the service you're looking to upgrade?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I've been working from home more lately, and my wife streams a lot of Netflix in the evenings, and honestly... it just buffers constantly. It's pretty frustrating.

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually a really common situation we see, especially with multiple people using the internet at the same time. The good news is, we have some excellent options that would be perfect for your situation. Are you open to hearing what we have available?

Customer: Yeah, for sure. What are you thinking?

Agent: Okay, so based on what you've told me, I'd recommend considering our Frontier 200 plan. You'd get speeds up to 200 megabits per second, which should definitely handle streaming and remote work without any of those buffering issues. We also have a Frontier 500 if you want to go even higher.

Customer: Hmm, 200 sounds pretty good. What's the pricing on that? I'm not trying to break the bank here.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so right now we have a promotional rate for existing customers like yourself. The Frontier 200 would be $59.99 a month for the first twelve months, and then it goes to our standard rate of $79.99 after that.

Customer: Oh, that's not too bad actually. And what about the 500 one you mentioned?

Agent: The Frontier 500 is $89.99 for the first year, then $109.99 after. That gives you up to 500 megabits per second download speeds. Honestly, for most households, the 200 is more than sufficient, but if you want that extra headroom, it's definitely an option.

Customer: No, I think 200 is good. I don't need to go crazy. How quickly can you set that up? Do I need new equipment?

Agent: Great choice! (typing sounds) So the good news is, your modem is actually compatible with our higher speeds, so you shouldn't need new equipment. However, if you'd like a newer modem that's optimized for the faster speeds, we could swap that out at no additional charge.

Customer: Yeah, sure, why not? New modem sounds good.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just make sure I have everything set up here. (typing sounds) So I'm going to upgrade you to the Frontier 200 plan at $59.99 for the first year. We'll schedule a technician to come out and install the new modem. Would you prefer a weekday appointment or weekend?

Customer: Um, probably a weekday would work better, actually. Just not next Tuesday—I have a doctor's appointment. Other than that, I'm pretty flexible.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so no next Tuesday. Let me check our availability... Looks like we have an opening this Thursday between 9 AM and 12 PM, or Friday afternoon between 1 and 4 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Thursday morning is perfect.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) I've got you scheduled for Thursday, April 18th between 9 and noon. The technician will text you about thirty minutes before they arrive. Your account will be updated to reflect the new plan as of tomorrow, and the new pricing takes effect with your next billing cycle.

Customer: That's great, thank you. Um, one more question—I've heard there's sometimes an installation fee or something?

Agent: That's a good question. Normally there would be a $99 installation fee, but I'm actually able to waive that for you as an existing customer. (pause) So you're all set there.

Customer: Oh wow, that's awesome. I really appreciate that.

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks so much for your help.

Agent: My pleasure! Just to recap, you're all set for Thursday morning for your modem installation, and your new speeds will be active. You should see a significant improvement. If you have any issues or questions, just give us a call back or you can reach out through your online account portal. Thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business.

Customer: Great, thanks again. Have a good day.

Agent: You too! Enjoy those faster speeds. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
