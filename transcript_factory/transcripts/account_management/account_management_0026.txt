Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan, and I've been thinking about upgrading. My work from home situation is... well, it's gotten more demanding, and honestly, my internet has been struggling lately.

Agent: I completely understand. I'd be happy to help you explore upgrade options. Let me just pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our 500 Mbps Fiber plan. Just out of curiosity, what kind of speeds are you looking for, or what's been giving you trouble with your current setup?

Customer: Well, I've got my partner also working from home now, and we're both doing video calls constantly. Plus, we stream a lot in the evenings. The other day we couldn't even load a web page while they were on a Zoom call. It was frustrating.

Agent: Yeah, that's definitely frustrating. So with multiple people on high-bandwidth activities simultaneously, you're probably hitting that ceiling pretty quick. We actually have a couple of options for you. We offer our 1 gig plan, which is one gigabit per second, or we also have a new 2 gig plan that just rolled out in your area. Both are Fiber, so you'd get the same reliable connection you're already used to, just significantly faster.

Customer: Wait, 2 gig? That seems... really fast. Do I even need that?

Agent: (chuckling) That's a fair question. For two people working from home with video conferencing, streaming, and general browsing, honestly, the 1 gig plan would probably be more than sufficient. The 2 gig is more for people who are doing heavy video production, gaming competitively, or you know, households with three or more people doing intensive work simultaneously. But it really depends on your usage and your budget.

Customer: Okay, yeah, the 1 gig sounds more reasonable. What's the price difference?

Agent: (typing) So you're currently paying... let me see here... you're at $79.99 a month for the 500 Mbps plan. If you upgrade to the 1 gig, that would be $99.99 monthly. And actually, we're running a promotion right now where if you commit to a two-year term, we can knock that down to $89.99 for the first 12 months.

Customer: Hmm, so $10 more per month regular price, but $10 less if I do the two years?

Agent: Exactly. So essentially, you'd be paying $89.99 for the first year, then it goes to the standard $99.99 after that. No installation fees with Fiber upgrades since you're already connected, so we could actually get you switched over pretty quickly. We'd just need to send out a technician to swap out your modem and router, and that's usually a pretty quick visit.

Customer: How long does that take?

Agent: Usually about 30 to 45 minutes total. We can schedule that at your convenience. How's your schedule looking? We have availability pretty much any day this week or next.

Customer: (pause) Um, I could probably do Wednesday afternoon? Like, after 2 PM?

Agent: (typing) Wednesday afternoon works great. We have a window between 2 and 5 PM available. Does that time slot work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect.

Agent: Excellent. So just to recap everything here before we finalize—we're upgrading you from 500 Mbps to 1 gigabit Fiber. Your new monthly rate is $89.99 for the first 12 months, then $99.99 after that. You're locked in for 24 months. The technician will visit on Wednesday between 2 and 5 PM to swap out your equipment. Does all of that sound good?

Customer: Yeah, actually that sounds great. Will I experience any downtime during the switch?

Agent: Good question. Your service will be down for maybe 5 to 10 minutes while we're provisioning the new modem, but that's about it. We'll make sure to let you know right before we do that so you and your partner can wrap up any calls.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome! Let me just send a confirmation email to the address on file with all these details and your technician appointment. You should receive that within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and thanks for calling. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
