Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Marcus. So I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet plan. My current speeds are just... they're not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've got some great options available. Before we dive in, let me just pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Okay, perfect. And just to confirm, is this a residential account?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, residential. I'm in Phoenix.

Agent: Awesome. All right, I'm looking at your account now. So you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan—that's our 100 megabit per second download speed. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine for a while, but now I'm working from home more, my wife streams a lot of Netflix, and the kids are constantly on YouTube or doing schoolwork online. It just... it buffers, it lags. I really need something faster.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. With multiple devices going at once, 100 Mbps can definitely get stretched thin. So what kind of activities are you looking to improve? Are we talking video conferencing for work, or...?

Customer: Well, yeah, video calls, but also I'd really like to stream 4K without it being choppy. And we've got smart home stuff too—cameras, thermostats, all that. I just want everything to run smoothly, you know?

Agent: Perfect. I'd definitely recommend looking at our Frontier Fiber 500 or maybe even our Fiber Gig plan, depending on your budget. The Gig plan gives you one gigabit per second, which is honestly plenty for everything you just mentioned. Let me tell you a bit about the difference. (pause) The Fiber 500 is $79.99 a month and gives you, obviously, 500 Mbps. The Fiber Gig is $99.99 a month for that full gigabit speed.

Customer: Okay, so it's like a $20 difference per month? What's the contract situation? I don't want to lock myself in for like three years or something.

Agent: Great question. Both of those plans come with our standard two-year service agreement. However, we do have the option... let me see here... (typing) We actually have a promotion running right now where if you upgrade to the Fiber Gig, we can waive your installation fees, which would normally be $99.

Customer: Oh, really? That's... that's not bad. How long is that promotion running?

Agent: (pause) That promotion is valid through the end of this month, so you'd need to get that locked in by April 30th. After that, we'd charge the standard installation fee.

Customer: Hmm. Okay, and I'm already getting fiber to my house, right? Like, the infrastructure is already there?

Agent: Yes, exactly. You're already on our fiber network in your area, so we wouldn't need to do any major installation work. It would just be a service upgrade, so the technician would come out, likely just need to swap your modem and maybe check the connection to make sure you're getting optimal speeds. Shouldn't take more than an hour or so.

Customer: That's good. And my current modem—will that work with the Gig speeds, or do I need to replace it?

Agent: So your current modem... (typing) you have our Frontier-issued model, and it's not compatible with our gigabit speeds. You'd need our newer model, which we'd provide as part of the upgrade. There's no charge for that—it's included.

Customer: Okay, cool. (pause) All right, you know what, I think I want to go with the Fiber Gig plan. Let's do it.

Agent: Excellent choice! I think you're really going to notice the difference. (typing) So just to confirm everything—we're upgrading you from Frontier Fiber 100 to Frontier Fiber Gig at $99.99 per month. We'll waive the $99 installation fee. And we're going to get a technician out to you... (pause) when would work best for you? We have availability next Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon, or we have Friday morning available as well.

Customer: Friday morning works. What time are we talking?

Agent: Technician appointments are scheduled between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that window work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine. I'll be around.

Agent: Perfect. (typing) All right, so we have Friday morning, April 25th, between 8 and 12. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive, just to confirm they're on the way. Is the phone number we have on file still the best number to reach you?

Customer: Uh... (pause) actually, no. Can you update it? It's 555-0892.

Agent: (typing) Okay, got it. 555-0892. And we have an email on file as well—is [inaudible]@gmail.com still correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's good.

Agent: Wonderful. So your new service will be active as of... (pause) Let me just... okay, so technically you can keep your current service until Friday, and then once the technician completes the installation, the new plan kicks in. You'll see the charge reflected on your next billing cycle. Your next billing date is May 3rd.

Customer: Great. And just to be clear—my bill is going from... what am I paying now?

Agent: You're currently paying $59.99 a month for the Fiber 100 plan. So yes, it'll go up to $99.99 with the Gig plan.

Customer: Right, okay. So about $40 more a month.

Agent: Yes, that's correct. But remember, you're getting ten times the speed and the installation fee is waived, so that's a solid value.

Customer: Yeah, no, I think it's worth it. I'm looking forward to it, honestly.

Agent: Awesome! I'm going to email you a confirmation of everything we discussed—the plan upgrade, the installation appointment for Friday morning, and your new rate. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being a loyal customer. We really appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
