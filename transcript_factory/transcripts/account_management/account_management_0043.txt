Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 meg plan, and honestly, I've been thinking about upgrading. My work from home situation has gotten pretty intense lately, and I feel like I'm starting to hit some speed bumps.

Agent: I totally understand. Working from home definitely puts more demand on your connection. Let me pull up your account here real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're on the 500 meg fiber plan currently. That's a solid speed. What kind of activities are you doing that's making you feel like you need more bandwidth?

Customer: Well, I'm doing a lot of video conferencing—like constant Zoom calls throughout the day—and then my wife is also working from home now, so she's streaming and doing her own thing. Plus, we've got like three other devices going, you know, phones, smart TV, whatever. It just feels like everything's slowing down sometimes, and the video calls get choppy.

Agent: Yeah, that's definitely a bandwidth issue. With multiple heavy users, you're probably hitting your limit there. (pause) So we have a couple of options for you. We can upgrade you to our gig plan—that's 1 gigabit per second—or if you want to go even higher, we have our gigabit plus plan, which is 1.2 gig. That's our top tier right now in your area.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference between the regular gig and the gig plus? Is it worth it?

Agent: Great question. Honestly, for most households, even with multiple users, the 1 gig plan is more than enough. The gig plus is really if you're doing something pretty intensive—like if you're streaming 4K video while simultaneously uploading large files or running servers. For your situation with work calls and general household streaming, I'd probably recommend the straight gig plan. You'll see a huge improvement from where you are now.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. What's the pricing looking like?

Agent: (typing sounds) So your current plan is $79.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: The gig plan is $99.99 a month, so you're looking at a $20 increase. And I should mention, we have a promotion running right now where we can lock that in for 12 months at $89.99 if you're willing to extend your service agreement.

Customer: Oh, interesting. So that's like $10 cheaper than the regular price?

Agent: Exactly. And the agreement is just 24 months, which is pretty standard. So you'd have that locked-in rate for the first year, and then it would go to the regular $99.99 after that. But at least you get a little break upfront.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think I'd rather not extend the agreement if I can help it. I'd rather keep my flexibility.

Agent: I completely understand. A lot of people prefer that. So we can absolutely set you up on the $99.99 plan without any contract if that's what works better for you. No problem at all.

Customer: Okay, yeah, let's do that then. When could that be installed? Or is it just a software thing since we already have fiber to the house?

Agent: Good question. Since you already have our fiber service and the infrastructure in place, this is just a configuration change on our end. We don't need a technician to come out. The upgrade can be processed today, and you should see the speed increase within 24 hours, typically much faster actually—sometimes within a few hours.

Customer: Oh wow, that's great. So I don't have to take time off work or anything?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. It's completely remote on our end. (typing sounds) Let me just confirm all the details here and get this squared away for you. So we're upgrading you from the 500 meg plan to the 1 gigabit plan at $99.99 per month, no contract extension. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect.

Agent: And I'm showing here that your service address is 4782 Oakmont Drive?

Customer: Yep, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Okay, so I'm processing this upgrade right now. (typing sounds) And... got it. Your new plan is active as of today. You should notice the speed improvement very shortly. You'll get a confirmation email at the address we have on file. Is that still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's the right one.

Agent: Wonderful. So just to recap everything, your new gig plan is active, billing will reflect the new $99.99 rate on your next invoice, and if you have any issues or need anything else, you can always reach back out to us or check your account online.

Customer: Great. Hey, I really appreciate it, Derek. This should definitely help with the work situation.

Agent: Happy to help! I think you're going to notice a big difference, especially with those video calls. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
