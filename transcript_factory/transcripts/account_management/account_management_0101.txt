Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on the 500 megabit plan and I'm thinking about upgrading. My internet's been pretty good, but I work from home now and I could use something faster.

Agent: Great, I'd be happy to help you explore some options. Working from home definitely puts more demand on the connection. Can I grab your account number or phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... um... (pause) it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And is this for the service address on file, or...?

Customer: Yeah, same address. I've been there for about three years now.

Agent: Awesome. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm seeing your account here. You're currently on our 500 Mbps fiber plan at $69.99 a month. You mentioned wanting to upgrade—are you looking to bump up to our gigabit plan, or were you curious about what else we have available?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, what's the difference between what I have and the gigabit? Is it worth the jump?

Agent: Great question. So the gigabit plan—that's our 940 Mbps service—it's basically one and a half times faster than what you're getting now. For working from home, if you're doing video calls, cloud uploads, that kind of stuff, it's definitely noticeable. Some customers have multiple people on their network too, so it helps with that. The gigabit plan is running $89.99 a month right now.

Customer: Okay, so twenty bucks more a month. And that's the fiber, right? The actual fiber connection?

Agent: Exactly, yes. Fiber all the way to your home. Same technology you're already on, just... more of it. (chuckles)

Customer: (laughs) Okay, that makes sense. Um, is there anything above that, or is gigabit the top tier?

Agent: That is actually our top tier for residential service in your area, so yeah, 940 Megs is as high as we go. But honestly, for most work-from-home scenarios, that's more than enough. You'd really notice a difference coming from 500.

Customer: Alright, and do I need new equipment or anything?

Agent: (typing sounds) Good thinking. Your current modem and router... let me see here. (pause) Yeah, so your equipment is a few years old. If you upgrade, I can send you our newer equipment at no charge, and it'll actually take advantage of those faster speeds better. Your current stuff will work, but you won't get the full benefit of the gigabit speeds.

Customer: Oh, interesting. So it's worth it to swap out?

Agent: I'd say yes, definitely. The new modem and router we have will give you better performance overall. And there's no additional fee for it—we'd just ship it out and you'd swap it out pretty easily. We'd even walk you through it on the phone if you need.

Customer: Nice. Okay, and how long would the new equipment take to arrive?

Agent: (typing sounds) Typically five to seven business days, depending on where you're shipping from. We'd give you tracking information, so you'd know exactly when it's coming.

Customer: That works. Um, one more question—do I need to do anything special, or does the speed upgrade just... happen?

Agent: Great question. So once the new equipment arrives and you set it up, you'll need to contact us to activate the service on the new equipment. Takes maybe five minutes on the phone or you can do it through our online portal. We'd basically just flip the switch on our end, and you're good to go. The billing would change on your next cycle.

Customer: Perfect. I think I'm ready to do it. Let's upgrade to the gigabit.

Agent: Excellent! (typing sounds) I'm going to get that set up for you right now. So to confirm, we're upgrading you from the 500 Mbps plan to the 940 Mbps gigabit plan at $89.99 a month, and we're sending out new equipment at no charge. The new rate will start on your next billing cycle.

Customer: That sounds right.

Agent: (typing sounds) Awesome. I'm just putting this through here... (pause) and I'm going to need to verify the phone number on file for you. Is it 555-0847?

Customer: Actually, no, that's my work line. My personal cell is 555-1923.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, updating that to 555-1923. Perfect. (pause) Alright, your upgrade is officially submitted. You should receive a confirmation email within the next couple hours, and that'll have all the details plus a tracking number for your equipment once it ships.

Customer: Great, I really appreciate it.

Agent: Of course! Just to recap, you're all set for the gigabit upgrade. You'll get the new equipment, and once it arrives, just give us a quick call back or use the portal to activate. If you have any questions at all before that happens, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here Monday through Friday, eight to nine, and weekends ten to six.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks again, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and enjoy that faster internet!

Customer: Will do. Have a good one.

Agent: You too, take care!
