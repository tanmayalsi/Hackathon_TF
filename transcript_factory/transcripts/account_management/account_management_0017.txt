Agent: Thanks for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with the service, but I'm thinking I might need to upgrade. My internet's been a little slow lately.

Agent: That's great to hear you're happy with us! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. We've got three kids doing remote school stuff, and my wife works from home now too, so there's just... there's a lot of devices on at the same time, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually really common, especially with multiple people streaming and video conferencing. (pause) So with Fiber 100, you're getting 100 megabits download. What speeds are you seeing when you run a test?

Customer: Um, I don't really know how to check that, honestly. But like, Netflix takes forever to load sometimes, and when my daughter's in her Zoom class and someone else is watching something, it just gets really choppy.

Agent: Yeah, that would definitely be a sign that you could benefit from more bandwidth. The good news is we have some great options. What kind of speeds would you be interested in? We offer Fiber 200, Fiber 500, or our top-tier Fiber Gigabit plan.

Customer: What's the difference in price? I mean, I don't want to go crazy with the bill, but I also want it to work properly.

Agent: Completely fair question. (typing sounds) So right now you're paying, looks like, $59.99 a month for the Fiber 100. If we upgrade you to Fiber 200, that would be $79.99 a month. Fiber 500 is $99.99, and Gigabit is $119.99.

Customer: Okay... (pause) What would you recommend? Like, with three kids and my wife working from home, what do you think we'd actually need?

Agent: Great question. Honestly, I'd probably recommend the Fiber 500 plan. It's a nice sweet spot for a household like yours. With four people potentially using the internet at peak times, 500 megabits gives you plenty of headroom. You could have someone streaming 4K, someone on a video call, and the kids doing schoolwork all at the same time without any issues.

Customer: That sounds good. How quick is the upgrade? Do I have to wait around for a technician or anything?

Agent: Good news there—since you already have our Fiber service, this is just a service tier upgrade. We don't need to send a technician out. It'll be activated within the next 24 hours, usually much faster. You might experience a brief service interruption of just a few minutes when we make the switch, probably in the middle of the night, but you shouldn't have to do anything on your end.

Customer: Oh wow, that's easy. Okay, let's do it. How do I... what do I need to do?

Agent: Perfect! I can process this right now for you. (typing sounds) So I'm setting this up as an upgrade from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500 effective immediately. Your new monthly rate will be $99.99. I'm also going to apply a promotional credit for the first three months, so you'll actually be paying $79.99 for the first quarter. Does that sound good?

Customer: Wait, really? Why the discount?

Agent: It's just a loyalty promotion we're running right now. Since you've been with us for three years and you're upgrading, I want to make sure we take care of you.

Customer: That's awesome, thank you. (pause) So what happens when the three months are up?

Agent: After that promotional period, you'll go to the regular $99.99 rate. But if anything changes, you can always call us back and we can look at other options or promotions that might be available at that time.

Customer: Good to know. And I don't have to do anything with my router or modem, right? Those will still work?

Agent: Your modem will be fine with the new speed. The router you might want to consider upgrading down the line if you have an older model, just to make sure you're getting the full speed, but that's not urgent. You might have it already—do you know what model router you have?

Customer: (pause) Uh... no clue. It's just... the white box thing that sits by my TV. [inaudible]

Agent: (chuckles) That's most people! Don't worry about it. Your internet will be faster immediately when we make the upgrade. And if you ever want to upgrade your router or have any questions, just give us a call back.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Let me just confirm everything here. I've got the Fiber 500 upgrade processing, your service address is still 4521 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. You should see the speed improvement within 24 hours. We'll send you a confirmation email with all the details. Is the email address on file still...

(typing sounds)

Agent: ...dsmith@emailprovider.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's still good.

Agent: Perfect. Then I think we're all set! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help, Marcus. I appreciate the discount too.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for being such a great customer, and thanks for calling Frontier. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
