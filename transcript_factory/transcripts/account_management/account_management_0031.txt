Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So I'm currently a customer, and I've been thinking about upgrading my internet speed. I'm on like... what is it... the 100 megabit plan right now, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I totally understand. We've had a lot of customers mentioning that lately, especially with more people working from home and streaming. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're on our Fiber 100 plan right now. When did you start noticing the slowdown?

Customer: Um, probably in the last couple months? My kid started remote school, and my wife's been working from home most days too. So like, three of us are all online at the same time, and things just started getting really sluggish. Videos buffer, Zoom calls get choppy... it's frustrating.

Agent: Yeah, that makes sense. With multiple people streaming and video conferencing simultaneously, 100 megs can definitely feel tight. The good news is, since you're already on our Fiber network, upgrading is super easy. We have a few options. What speeds are you interested in? We offer 300 megs, 500 megs, or our gigabit plan at 940 megs.

Customer: What's the price difference? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so right now you're at... looks like $59.99 a month. Our Fiber 300 plan is $79.99, the 500 meg is $99.99, and the gig plan is $129.99. But actually, I'm seeing we have a promotion running through the end of the month where you can lock in the 300 plan for $69.99 for the first year.

Customer: Oh, that's not too bad. What about after the year?

Agent: After twelve months it would go to the regular price of $79.99 a month. But you're not locked into a contract or anything, so if you ever want to upgrade or downgrade, you're free to do so.

Customer: Hmm. Would the 300 be enough for what I was describing? The three of us streaming and working from home?

Agent: Absolutely. 300 megs is plenty for that kind of usage. You could have like... Netflix running in 4K in one room, Zoom calls happening, maybe some gaming or music streaming—all at the same time, no problem. I'd say for your situation, 300 would be ideal. The gig plan is more for people who are like... running large file transfers, heavy IT operations, that kind of thing.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Three hundred sounds good then. Can we get that promotion locked in?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, for sure! I can absolutely process that upgrade for you right now. The good news is, since you're already on Fiber, we don't need to send a technician out or anything. It's all back-end stuff. Your speed should increase within the next 24 hours, typically much faster than that actually.

Customer: Wait, really? It's that simple?

Agent: (chuckling) Yeah, it really is! That's one of the benefits of Fiber. We just adjust things on our end, and boom—you're good to go. You don't need a new modem or anything, your current equipment will handle the speeds no problem.

Customer: That's awesome. So what happens now? Do I need to do anything?

Agent: Nope, I'm gonna go ahead and apply this upgrade to your account. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so just to confirm everything—I'm upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300 at the promotional rate of $69.99 per month for the first 12 months, then $79.99 after. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. And this goes into effect right away?

Agent: Yeah, so I'm processing it now. You should see the changes in your account by tomorrow morning at the latest. You might want to restart your router just to be safe, but honestly, sometimes it updates without you needing to do anything. I'll send you a confirmation email with all the details and your new service information.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you so much!

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You should start seeing that improved speed really soon, so hopefully your family's experience is a lot smoother now. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
