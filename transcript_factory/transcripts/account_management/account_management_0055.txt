Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently a customer and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. I've got the basic 100 meg plan right now and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've got some great options available. Before we dive into those, let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're on our 100 megabit plan in the Asheville area. And you mentioned it's not meeting your needs anymore?

Customer: Right, so my wife started working from home about six months ago, and now we've got our kids doing online school, and I'm streaming stuff in the evenings, and... it just seems like everything's buffering constantly. I don't know if it's the plan or what, but it's frustrating.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. With multiple people on the network doing bandwidth-heavy activities like video conferencing and streaming, 100 meg can definitely get tight. How many devices are typically connected at once?

Customer: I'd say... easily five or six? Sometimes more with the kids' tablets and everything.

Agent: Okay, so you've got quite a bit going on. (pause) I'd probably recommend looking at our 400 megabit plan. That would give you plenty of headroom for video calls, streaming, online school, all of that running simultaneously without the slowdowns you're experiencing.

Customer: Four hundred meg? That sounds pretty fast. What would that run me monthly?

Agent: So currently you're at $59.99 a month with your 100 meg plan, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Great. The 400 meg plan is $79.99 per month for the first twelve months. After that, it would be $99.99. But honestly, even at the regular price, you're getting about four times the speed for just forty more dollars a month.

Customer: Hmm, okay. And I wouldn't need a new modem or anything like that, right?

Agent: That's a good question. Your current modem might be compatible, but for the 400 meg speeds, I'd actually recommend upgrading to one of our newer modems. The good news is, if you upgrade today, we can waive the modem fee and include it in your service at no additional cost. It's usually a $15 monthly charge.

Customer: Oh, that's... okay, that's actually not bad then. So it would be $79.99 with the modem included?

Agent: Exactly. And we'd ship the new modem to you free of charge. Installation is also complimentary. You'd just need to be home during our service window, which is typically a four-hour window that you can schedule.

Customer: Nice. And how long would it take to get set up?

Agent: (typing sounds) So we have availability next Tuesday through Thursday of next week. Would any of those days work for you?

Customer: Tuesday would be good. What time would you need me home?

Agent: We can do either morning, which is 8 AM to noon, or afternoon from 1 PM to 5 PM.

Customer: Morning works better for me. Let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) So just to confirm what we're doing here - we're upgrading you from the 100 meg to our 400 megabit plan at $79.99 for the first year. We're including a modem upgrade with free installation, and we've got you scheduled for Tuesday morning between 8 and noon.

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. And my service will be faster right away once the new modem is installed?

Agent: Absolutely. You should notice a significant difference immediately. And if for any reason you're not satisfied with the upgrade within the first 30 days, just give us a call and we can adjust things.

Customer: Okay, good. That's good to know. Um, is there anything else I need to do before Tuesday?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home to sign off on the installation. Our technician will test everything once it's set up to make sure you're getting the speeds you're paying for. Oh, and if you have any questions before Tuesday, just give us a call back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Marcus, I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! I'm gonna send a confirmation email to the address on file with all the details and the service window. You should see that within the next hour or so. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks, have a good one.

Agent: You too. Take care!
