# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet. My current speed is, um, I think it's like 100 megabits? And honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore. My kids are doing remote school and I'm working from home, and we're all fighting over bandwidth constantly.

Agent: I totally understand. That's a really common issue we hear about, especially with multiple people online at once. I'd be happy to help you explore some better options. Can I grab your account information first? What's the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing your account. So you're right, you're currently on our 100 Mbps fiber plan. How long have you had that service with us?

Customer: Um, I think about three years now? Maybe a little longer. You guys actually just ran the fiber line to our neighborhood, so we switched over from cable.

Agent: Oh nice, so you're already enjoying some of that fiber reliability. Well, the good news is we've actually expanded our service tiers since you signed up. We now offer speeds up to 940 Megabits per second. Are you interested in hearing about those options?

Customer: 940? (laughs) Wow, okay. Yeah, that sounds... that sounds like a lot. What would that cost? Like, am I gonna be paying double?

Agent: (pause) That's a great question. So our pricing is actually pretty competitive. Right now we're running a promotion for existing customers like yourself. Your current plan is probably around $64.99 a month, is that about right?

Customer: Yeah, something like that. Maybe a little more with taxes and fees.

Agent: Right, exactly. So if you upgrade to our 300 Mbps fiber plan, it would be $74.99 for the first 12 months, and that's actually locked in. After that, it goes to the regular rate of $89.99. But for many customers, 300 is really the sweet spot for households like yours.

Customer: And what's the difference between that and the... what was it, 940?

Agent: Good question. So the 940 plan is our top tier. That's really built more for heavy-duty streaming, gaming, or if you're running like a small business from your home with video conferencing and uploading large files all day. For most people with a few people streaming and working from home, the 300 really handles it beautifully.

Customer: I mean, my oldest does online gaming, and my wife does a lot of video calls for work, so... maybe the higher one makes sense?

Agent: That actually does sound like it could be a good fit, then. The 940 Mbps plan is $99.99 for the first year, then $129.99 after that. (pause) I know that's a bit of a jump, but you'd really notice the difference with gaming and video conferencing. No lag, no buffering, super stable connection.

Customer: Hmm. Let me think about this for a second. Is the 300 plan... like, could we always upgrade later if we need to?

Agent: Absolutely, yeah. No problem upgrading down the road. You wouldn't even need to call us—you could do it right through your online portal, or give us a call back and we can walk you through it. There's no penalty for upgrading to a faster speed.

Customer: Okay, you know what? Let's go with the 300 then. We can see how that goes, and if it's still not enough, we'll bump it up.

Agent: Perfect! That's a smart move. (typing sounds) So I'm going to get you set up on the 300 Mbps fiber plan. The promotion rate of $74.99 is locked in for your first 12 months. And just so you know, there's no installation fee for upgrades to your service—we'll just push that through to your existing equipment.

Customer: Oh nice, so I don't need a new modem or anything?

Agent: Great question. Actually, let me verify something here. Your current modem should be compatible, but let me just double-check the model number on your account... (pause) Yeah, you're all set. Your current equipment will work perfectly fine at these speeds.

Customer: Awesome, that saves me some headache.

Agent: Definitely. Okay, so the upgrade will be effective as of tomorrow. You should see the speed improvement pretty much right away. Just give it maybe an hour after our systems update, and then you can run a speed test if you want to confirm everything's working.

Customer: How do I do a speed test?

Agent: You can just go to speedtest.net in your web browser—it's really simple, just click the button and it'll show you your actual download and upload speeds. But honestly, you'll probably just notice it feels faster when you're using it.

Customer: (laughs) Yeah, I'm hoping the kids will stop complaining about the internet being slow!

Agent: (laughs) That's what we like to hear. Alright, so let me just confirm everything for you. I'm upgrading you from 100 Mbps to 300 Mbps fiber. Your new rate is $74.99 per month for the first 12 months. Is that correct?

Customer: Yep, that's right.

Agent: Great. And the email address on file is still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Actually, I want to make sure my work email gets the bill. Can we change that to my work email? It's james.patterson at [inaudible] dot com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely, let me update that for you. (pause) Okay, done. You'll start getting your bills sent there. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for making this easy!

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You should be all set. If you have any questions after the upgrade goes through tomorrow, feel free to give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!
