Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My speeds have been pretty slow lately, and I'm working from home now, so I need something faster.

Agent: Oh, absolutely. I'd be happy to help you with that. Just so I can pull up your account, can I get the phone number associated with your Frontier account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get the last four digits of the Social Security number on the account, just for verification?

Customer: It's 4829.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, thank you. Okay, so I'm looking at your account here and I can see you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Hundred megs, right? And honestly, it was fine when I was just streaming stuff, but now that I'm on video calls all day for work, it's... it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I totally understand. Working from home definitely changes your internet needs. So we have a few options available in your area. What speeds are you looking for? Are you thinking maybe our Fiber 500 plan, or would you want to go even higher?

Customer: Um, what's the difference? Like, how much faster is 500 compared to the 100?

Agent: Great question. So 500 megs is five times faster than what you currently have. It's really solid for video conferencing, multiple users streaming at the same time, large file uploads and downloads. For most work-from-home situations, that's the sweet spot.

Customer: Yeah, that sounds like it would help. What about the Gig plan? Is that like, overkill?

Agent: (pause) Well, it depends on your usage. Our Gigabit plan is definitely powerful and future-proofs you for years to come, but for typical work-from-home use with video calls and regular web browsing, the 500 usually does the job. That said, if you have multiple people in your household using bandwidth-heavy applications, the Gig is never a bad choice.

Customer: It's just me, so I think 500 should be fine. What's the price difference?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so for your area, the Fiber 500 plan is $79.99 a month for the first 12 months, then it goes to our regular rate of $99.99 after that. Your current plan is $59.99 a month, so you'd be looking at an increase of about $20 a month for the first year.

Customer: Okay, and there's no installation fee or anything?

Agent: (typing sounds) Actually, because you're an existing customer upgrading, we can waive the installation fee. There's no charge for that. We can get you scheduled as soon as tomorrow if you're available.

Customer: Oh, nice. Yeah, that works. What time tomorrow?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (pause) We have morning slots between 8 and 11 AM, or afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: Morning is better. Can you do like, 9 o'clock?

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. So that's tomorrow, [inaudible] March 14th at 9 AM for an installation at 555... (trailing off as if confirming address on screen) ...Maple Street, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Beautiful. And just to let you know, our technician will be there to install the upgraded equipment, it should take about an hour or so. You'll need to have the modem and router swapped out, so you might experience a brief outage during that time.

Customer: Okay, that's fine. And I'll get the new modem and everything included?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. All new equipment is included with your upgrade. You'll have a brand new modem and our latest Wi-Fi 6 router, which is really going to give you better coverage and speeds throughout your home.

Customer: Great. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure you have access to the area where your modem is currently installed, and if you have anything plugged into your current router, just unplug those before the technician arrives. Oh, and it's helpful if you have your current Frontier bill handy so the technician can verify your account information.

Customer: Got it. And this upgrade starts tomorrow, right? Or does it take a few days?

Agent: Once the technician completes the installation tomorrow and activates everything, your new speeds should be live immediately. You'll notice the difference right away.

Customer: Awesome. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Let me just confirm a few things. (typing sounds) Your new plan will be Fiber 500 at $79.99 per month for 12 months. Installation is waived. You're all set for tomorrow at 9 AM. We'll send you a confirmation email with the technician details in the next few minutes, and you should also get a text message reminder about 24 hours before the appointment.

Customer: Perfect. That sounds great, Derek. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm excited to get those faster speeds.

Agent: You're going to love it. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see you tomorrow morning at 9 AM. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too!

Agent: Bye now!
