# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet service. My current plan is just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your phone number or account number, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847. That's my phone number associated with the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm looking at your account now. I see you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine when I first got it like two years ago, but now with everyone working from home in my house and my kids doing online school... it's just not fast enough anymore.

Agent: Yeah, I completely understand. We've definitely seen a lot of that since the pandemic. So what are you experiencing? Is it slow downloads, buffering when you're streaming...?

Customer: Everything, really. Like, when my wife is on a Zoom call and I'm trying to download files for work, the connection just tanks. And my kids can't even watch YouTube without it freezing up.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so it sounds like you need something with more bandwidth to handle multiple users. Let me show you what we have available in your area. We actually have some great options. You can upgrade to our Fiber 300 plan, which would give you speeds up to 300 megabits per second, or if you really want the best performance, we have our Fiber Gigabit plan with up to 940 megabits per second.

Customer: Wow, that's... that's a big jump from what I have. What's the difference in price?

Agent: Great question. So your current Fiber 100 plan is $59.99 per month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: The Fiber 300 would be $79.99 per month, so that's an additional $20. And the Fiber Gigabit plan is $99.99 per month. Now, I should mention we have a promotional rate right now for new upgrades. If you upgrade today, I can get you the Fiber 300 plan for the first year at $69.99 per month instead of the regular price.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad. But what about after the first year?

Agent: After the promotional period, it would go to the regular rate of $79.99. But honestly, a lot of our customers find that the Fiber 300 handles multiple devices really well. It should definitely solve the issues you're experiencing.

Customer: Yeah, I think that might be the sweet spot. I don't really need gigabit speeds, I just need things to run smoothly, you know?

Agent: Absolutely, and I think you'll be really happy with the 300. Let me just confirm a few things. Your service address is still 4521 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And just to let you know, we'll need to send a technician out to upgrade your equipment. That's complimentary with the service upgrade. How does your schedule look? We can do it between 8 AM and 5 PM on weekdays, or we do have some Saturday appointments available as well.

Customer: Um, let me think. This Friday would work for me. In the morning would be better if that's available.

Agent: (typing) Let me check what we have... (pause) Okay, I can get you down for this Friday, May 17th, between 8 AM and noon. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect.

Agent: Great! So the technician will come out, install new equipment, and you should be up and running on the Fiber 300 plan right away. The installation is free, and you won't see any charges until next month's billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Oh wait, one question—will I need to do anything to my modem or router?

Agent: The technician will handle all of that. They'll bring new equipment if needed, set everything up for you, and make sure you're connected and ready to go. You literally won't have to do a thing except maybe restart your devices once we get everything activated.

Customer: Perfect. That sounds great. Thank you so much.

Agent: You're very welcome! Just to recap, you're all set for an upgrade to Fiber 300 this Friday, May 17th, between 8 AM and noon. You'll see the promotional rate of $69.99 per month for the first year. A confirmation email will be sent to the address on file, and you can also track your appointment in our customer portal if you need to.

Customer: Awesome. I appreciate it, Marcus.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we really appreciate your business! Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's all. Have a good day!

Agent: You too! Thank you for calling Frontier. Goodbye!

Customer: Bye!
