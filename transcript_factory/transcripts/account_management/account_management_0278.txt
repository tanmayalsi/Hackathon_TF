Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've had your internet service for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading. My current speeds aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Before we get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, I'm speaking with... what's your name?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: Great, James. Thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing you're currently on our 300 Mbps plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. But honestly, with working from home now and my kids doing online school, we're constantly buffering and dropping out of Zoom calls. It's been really frustrating.

Agent: I totally understand. That's a pretty common issue when you've got multiple people streaming or video conferencing simultaneously. The good news is we've got some excellent options for you. What kind of speeds are you looking to get?

Customer: I'm not really sure what I need, to be honest. What do you recommend?

Agent: Well, that depends on your household. You mentioned you're working from home and your kids are doing schoolwork online. Do you have any other heavy internet users in the house?

Customer: Uh, my wife uses it for work too. And my oldest son, he's into gaming, so he's always downloading stuff or streaming. (laughs) So yeah, pretty heavy usage overall.

Agent: (chuckling) Okay, okay. Yeah, that sounds like you'd be a perfect fit for our 500 Mbps plan, or honestly, you might even want to consider our gigabit option—that's 1,000 Mbps. That would give you plenty of bandwidth for everyone. The gigabit plan would handle all of that without any issues at all.

Customer: Wow, 1,000? That seems like a lot. Is it... I mean, is it expensive?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me look at what we can offer you. Since you're a current customer, I can definitely get you a promotion. So the gigabit plan is normally $89 a month, but I can get you a promotional rate of $69 a month for the first twelve months.

Customer: That's... actually not too bad. What about after the twelve months?

Agent: After the promotion period, it would go to our standard rate, which is $89 a month. But you'd have the option to call back at that time, and we often have other promotions available. Plus, you'd still be under contract rates as an existing customer.

Customer: Okay, and what about installation? Do I need to wait a long time for that?

Agent: Great question. (pause) Let me check our availability in your area. (typing sounds) We actually have availability this Friday between 8 AM and 5 PM, or we also have Monday afternoon open. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: This Friday? That's perfect, actually. Let's do Friday morning if you have it.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) I'm going to note you down for Friday between 8 AM and noon. Our technician will come out, swap your modem and router for our newer gigabit-capable equipment, and get everything set up. The visit usually takes about an hour.

Customer: Cool. And I don't have to pay anything extra for the new equipment, right?

Agent: That's correct. The equipment is included with your service. You'll just have the monthly service charge. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today? Any questions about the installation or the service?

Customer: Uh... (pause) what about my current modem and router? What happens to those?

Agent: That's a good question. Since those are Frontier equipment, the technician will take those back during the installation. If you have any personal devices connected to them, you'll want to make sure those are backed up or transferred over beforehand.

Customer: Oh, okay. Yeah, I'll make a note of that.

Agent: Perfect. And just to recap everything: you're upgrading from 300 Mbps to our 1,000 Mbps gigabit plan at a promotional rate of $69 a month for the first year. Installation is scheduled for this Friday, between 8 AM and noon. A technician will come out and handle everything.

Customer: Yep, that all sounds right.

Agent: Excellent! I'm going to send you a confirmation email at the address on file. You'll get all the details about the installation appointment, plus some tips on setting up your new equipment. Is that email address still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Uh, actually, it's james.mitchell1982@gmail.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've updated that. You should receive the confirmation within the next few minutes. And James, I really appreciate you sticking with Frontier. If you have any issues or questions before Friday, don't hesitate to give us a call back.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. I really appreciate the help and the good rate.

Agent: My pleasure! You're all set. Have a great day, and we'll see you on Friday!

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye!
