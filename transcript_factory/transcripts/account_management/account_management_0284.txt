Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm just... I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. My current speed is like, what is it... 300 megabits? And honestly, it's been fine, but I'm working from home more now, and I feel like I need something faster.

Agent: I totally understand. Working from home definitely puts more demand on your connection. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Oh sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, got it. So you're currently on our Fiber 300 plan, which gives you 300 Mbps download speeds. What kind of activities are you doing that's making you feel like you need an upgrade? Are you streaming, gaming, video conferencing...?

Customer: Yeah, mostly video conferencing. I'm on Zoom calls like all day, and sometimes my roommate is also working from home, so we're both online at the same time. Plus, I like to stream stuff in my downtime, and... I don't know, lately it just feels slow.

Agent: Okay, yeah, that makes total sense. Multiple video conferences plus streaming would definitely benefit from higher speeds. We have a few options for you. Our next tier up is Fiber 500, which gives you 500 Mbps download speeds, or if you really want to future-proof yourself, we have Fiber Gig Plus, which is a full gigabit—that's 1,000 Mbps.

Customer: Wow, okay. That's a pretty big jump from 500 to 1,000. Is that... I mean, is that overkill? How much more would that be?

Agent: Great question. (pause, typing sounds) So, Fiber 500 would be $79.99 a month, and that's actually just a $10 increase from what you're paying now. Fiber Gig Plus is $99.99 a month. Now, I should mention that we're currently running a promotion where if you upgrade today, we can waive your installation fee, which normally runs about $99.

Customer: Oh really? That's... that's actually pretty good. So the $10 difference would be between the 300 and the 500?

Agent: Exactly. $69.99 for your current plan, and $79.99 for the 500. (brief pause) Although, I gotta be honest with you—for the value, I'd personally recommend at least going with the 500. That gives you a nice buffer for multiple devices and users on your network. The gig speed is incredible, but if you're not gaming competitively or doing heavy data transfers, the 500 is typically the sweet spot.

Customer: Yeah, yeah, that sounds more reasonable. Let me go with the 500 then. Can you... do I need to, like, buy new equipment or anything?

Agent: So you'll get a new gateway modem that's compatible with the Fiber 500 speeds. We'd ship that out to you, or you can have it installed professionally. With the promotion I mentioned, the professional installation would be free. It usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour, and our technician can set everything up and test it out for you.

Customer: That sounds good. When could that happen?

Agent: (typing) Let me check our availability. What days work best for you? We can typically get someone out within the next few days to a week, depending on your area.

Customer: Um, this coming Saturday would be ideal, if that's possible?

Agent: (pause, typing) Let me see... yes, we actually have Saturday afternoon available. Would somewhere between 1 and 4 PM work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works perfect.

Agent: Awesome. (typing) Okay, so I'm going to get you scheduled for this Saturday, March 15th, between 1 and 4 PM. You'll receive a confirmation email and a text message with those details, and you can also track the technician's arrival on our app if you'd like.

Customer: Great, great. And just to confirm, the $10 increase starts right away, or...?

Agent: The rate change will go into effect on your next billing cycle. You should see the new rate reflected on your next bill. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for making this so easy, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! We really appreciate your business, and thank you for choosing Frontier for your upgrade. You're going to notice a huge difference with those speeds, especially with multiple people on the network. If you have any questions before Saturday, feel free to give us a call back. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Thank you, bye now.
