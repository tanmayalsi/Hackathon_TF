Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer with you guys for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. And just to confirm, is this for your service at 2834 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. So, I'm seeing here that you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine for a while, but now with my daughter doing online classes from home and my wife working remotely, we're constantly hitting the speed cap. It's been really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand. That happens a lot, especially with multiple people streaming and working from home. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking to upgrade to? Are you interested in our 300 megabit plan, or would you want to go all the way up to our Gig plan?

Customer: What's the difference in price between those two?

Agent: Great question. So your current plan at 100 megs is $64.99 a month. Our 300 meg plan is $84.99, and then our gigabit plan, which gives you up to 1,000 megs, is $99.99 per month.

Customer: (pause) Wow, okay. And that's just for the internet, right? I'm not getting anything else bundled in there?

Agent: That's correct, just the internet service. However, I should mention—and I apologize if this is something we didn't discuss when you first signed up—but for your account specifically, I'm seeing that you're eligible for a loyalty promotion right now. We can actually get you the 300 meg plan for $74.99 per month for the first year.

Customer: Really? That's... that's actually pretty good. How long is that promotion for?

Agent: So the promotional rate is locked in for 12 months. After that, it would go to the regular rate of $84.99, but you'd still have the option to call us back and we could look at other offers or plans at that time.

Customer: Okay, and would I need a new modem or anything like that? I have the one you guys gave me when we signed up.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check the model you have... it looks like you have an older model. The good news is that the 300 meg speeds should work fine with what you have, but honestly, for optimal performance, I'd recommend upgrading to our newer modem. It's a one-time equipment fee of $99, but it's compatible with all our fiber speeds and you'd notice a significant difference.

Customer: Do I have to do it right now?

Agent: No, not at all. We can upgrade you to the service plan today, and you can decide about the modem whenever you're ready. We can add it later if you change your mind, or you can pick one up in-store as well.

Customer: Alright, that sounds good. Let's go ahead with the 300 meg plan. But I'll hold off on the modem for now.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just go ahead and process that upgrade for you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm updating your service plan to the Frontier Fiber 300 at the promotional rate of $74.99 per month. Your service speed should increase within 24 hours. Is there anything else I can help clarify before we finalize this?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Oh, actually, one quick question—will this affect my current bill or internet?

Agent: Great question. Your current service will continue as normal until tomorrow morning around 3 to 6 AM. You might experience a brief service interruption during that window while we push the speed upgrade to your modem. After that, you should be good to go at the faster speeds. Your next bill will reflect the new rate, and it'll be prorated if necessary for this billing cycle.

Customer: Okay, perfect. I really appreciate your help, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! I'm glad we could get you sorted out. Is there a phone number where we can reach you if we have any issues during the upgrade?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147, same as my account.

Agent: Perfect, that's what I have on file already. Well, thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and enjoy those faster speeds! If you need anything else in the future, just give us a call back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again!

Agent: Have a great day!
