Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate your loyalty, and I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Let me pull up your account here real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, thank you. Okay, so I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 500 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've got the 500 megabits per second, I think?

Agent: Exactly. That's 500 Mbps download speeds. And what's prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, streaming a lot, or...?

Customer: Both, actually. I've been working from home full-time for the past year, and my household has three other people. So we've got like, multiple video calls happening, someone streaming Netflix, my roommate gaming... It's just been getting really slow lately. Sometimes my video freezes up in the middle of important meetings.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. With multiple users on the same connection, 500 Mbps can definitely get stretched thin. The good news is that we have some great options available to you. We offer Fiber 1000, which is our gig-speed service at 1 Gbps, and we also have Fiber 200 if you're looking for something in the middle at 200 Mbps.

Customer: Wait, I thought you said I had 500?

Agent: You do, yes. So Fiber 200 would actually be a downgrade. I apologize for the confusion there. Let me clarify—our main upgrade option for you would be Fiber 1000, which is double your current speed. That's our gigabit plan.

Customer: Oh, okay. So basically I can double my speed?

Agent: Exactly right. You'd go from 500 Mbps to 1000 Mbps. That should handle all the simultaneous streaming, gaming, and video conferencing without any issues. It's more than enough bandwidth for what you're describing.

Customer: That sounds pretty good. How much more would that be per month?

Agent: (pause) Let me check the pricing on that for you. (typing sounds) So your current plan is $89.99 a month, and the Fiber 1000 would be $129.99 per month. So that's an additional $40 per month.

Customer: Hmm, that's a bit more than I was hoping for. Do you have any promotions or anything going on right now?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me see what I can do for you. (longer pause, typing) Okay, so since you've been a loyal customer for three years, I can actually apply a promotional rate. I can get you Fiber 1000 for $99.99 for the first twelve months. After that, it would go to the regular rate of $129.99. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh wow, really? That's... that's actually pretty reasonable. That's only ten dollars more than what I'm paying now.

Agent: Exactly. And you'll be getting double the speeds for that price point during that promotional period. It's a pretty solid deal.

Customer: Yeah, I think I want to do it. Do I need to do anything on my end, or...?

Agent: Great! I'm glad I could help. So we can go ahead and process this upgrade for you right now. The installation is actually free since we already have Fiber running to your location. We can schedule a technician to come out and swap your modem for our gig-capable equipment. It usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour.

Customer: Okay, when could someone come out?

Agent: (typing) What does your schedule look like? We have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM, or we could do later this week. What works best for you?

Customer: Tomorrow would be great, actually. I'm planning to work from home anyway.

Agent: Perfect. How about 10 AM to 12 PM? Would that window work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) Alright, so I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, Saturday... excuse me, Friday, March 15th between 10 AM and noon. A technician will come to your residence at 555 [inaudible] to install the new modem and get you set up on Fiber 1000. You should see speeds nearly double once the upgrade is complete.

Customer: Great. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure you have access to where your current modem is located so the technician can access it. They'll handle the rest. And just a heads up, during the swap there might be a brief moment where your internet goes down—usually just a few seconds to a minute—but that's completely normal.

Customer: Okay, no problem. So to confirm, I'm going from 500 to 1000 Mbps, it's $99.99 for the first year, and someone's coming tomorrow morning?

Agent: That's absolutely correct. And I'm going to send a confirmation email to the email address on file. You'll receive all the details there as well. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure. I really appreciate your business, and I think you're going to love the speed upgrade. If you have any issues at all after the technician leaves, just give us a call back and we'll get you sorted out.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now.
