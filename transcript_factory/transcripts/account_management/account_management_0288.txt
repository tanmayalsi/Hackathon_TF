Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 meg plan, and honestly, I've been thinking about upgrading. My kids are doing remote schooling now, and we've got like four devices streaming at once most nights, and the speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually pretty common, especially with more people working and learning from home these days. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got you here. So I'm seeing you're on the 500 meg fiber plan in the Scottsdale area, and you've been with us for about three years. Great customer, no issues on the account. Now, what speeds were you thinking about? We have a few options available at your address.

Customer: Um, well what do you have? I mean, ideally something faster, but I don't want to go crazy with the price, you know?

Agent: Yeah, totally fair. So for your location, we can offer you our gig plan—that's 1 gigabit per second download speeds. Or we have a 750 meg option that falls right in between what you're on now and the gig. The 750 is usually a really good sweet spot for families with multiple devices.

Customer: What's the difference in price between what I'm paying now and the 750?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so right now you're at... $79.99 a month for the 500 meg plan. The 750 meg would be $99.99 a month.

Customer: And the gig plan?

Agent: That one is $119.99 per month.

Customer: (pause) Okay, hmm. What's the contract situation? Do I have to sign up for anything?

Agent: Good question. So both of those plans come with our standard service agreement. It's a one-year term, but if you stay with us past that year, there's no penalty—you can keep the promotional rate we offer. Actually, let me see what promotions are running right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so if you upgrade today, I can get you the 750 meg plan at $89.99 for the first year, then it goes to the regular $99.99 after that.

Customer: That's for the first year only?

Agent: Yes, the promotional rate is for the first 12 months of service. After that, it'll be the standard $99.99 unless there are other promotions we're running at that time.

Customer: Okay, and... what about installation? Do I need to have someone come out?

Agent: Since you're already on fiber with us, we don't need to send a technician unless there's something specific about your setup. We can upgrade your modem and router remotely, actually. Most of the time that can be done the same day or next business day depending on your availability.

Customer: Really? That's nice. I was worried I'd have to take time off work or something.

Agent: Yeah, no, we try to make it as convenient as possible. You'd just need to have someone there to potentially reset the equipment if needed, but honestly most customers don't even have to do that. (pause) So, are you leaning toward the 750 plan?

Customer: I think so, yeah. I mean, $10 a month more seems reasonable if it's gonna stop my Zoom calls from freezing up.

Agent: (chuckles) I hear you. That should definitely solve those issues. Let me just go over what we're doing here, and then I'll get you all set up. We're upgrading you from the 500 meg fiber plan to the 750 meg fiber plan. The promotional rate is $89.99 for the first year, then $99.99 after that. New modem and router will be shipped to you, should arrive within three to five business days, and we can have your service upgraded within 24 hours of you letting us know you're ready.

Customer: Sounds good to me.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, and I'm just confirming the service address is still 2847 Paradise Valley Road?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And we'll keep your email on file as [inaudible] for the service notifications, is that still good?

Customer: Um, actually, can you update that? I've got a new email—it's sarah.mitchell.1982 at gmail dot com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. Sarah.mitchell.1982 at gmail. Let me just pull up one more thing here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so the upgrade is all set to process. Your new equipment should be there by... let's see, today's Thursday, so likely by next Wednesday or Thursday at the latest. You'll get a tracking notification to that new email address. And then once you have the equipment, just give us a call back or use our online portal to activate the new service.

Customer: Okay, great. And there's no extra fee for the modem and router or anything like that?

Agent: Nope, they're included with the service. You're all set there. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You should be all set, and if you have any questions once your equipment arrives, just don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
