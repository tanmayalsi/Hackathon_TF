Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with the service, but I'm thinking I need to upgrade. My internet's been feeling a little slow lately.

Agent: Oh, great! I'm glad to hear you've been happy with us. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account real quick?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I've got you. So you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right. I think it's the 100 meg one.

Agent: Yep, that's the one. So what kind of activities are you finding are slowing things down? Is it streaming, gaming, working from home... just curious what's driving the need for more speed?

Customer: Oh, a bit of everything, honestly. My wife works from home now, and I like to stream movies and stuff. Plus we've got two teenagers who are constantly on their devices. So when everyone's using it at the same time, it just... it lags, you know?

Agent: (pause) Oh yeah, I totally get that. Multiple users definitely impacts things. So with four people all online simultaneously, 100 megs might be getting a little tight. We actually have some really solid options that would handle that much better. Let me see what we have available in your area... (typing sounds)

Customer: Okay, cool. What are my options?

Agent: Alright, so right now we can upgrade you to either our Fiber 300 plan or our Fiber 500 plan. Both of those are available at your address. The Fiber 300 is gonna run you $79.99 a month, and that would be... let me see here... (pause) that would be about a $25 increase from what you're paying now.

Customer: And what about the 500?

Agent: The 500 is $109.99 a month, so that's a bit more of a jump, but honestly, for a household with four people, that's probably my recommendation. That's gonna handle all your streaming, working from home, whatever the kids are doing, and you won't experience that lag you've been having.

Customer: Hmm, that's not too bad actually. But can I ask—is there any kind of promotion or anything running right now? I hate to be that person, but I'm always seeing ads about deals.

Agent: (chuckles) No, no, I totally understand. Let me check what we have available... (pause, typing sounds) You know what, because you've been such a loyal customer for three years with us, I can actually offer you the Fiber 500 at $99.99 for the first 12 months. After that it goes to the regular $109.99, but that's a $10 savings for the first year.

Customer: Oh, that's nice! Yeah, that sounds pretty good actually. So it's $99.99 for a year, then it goes up to $109.99?

Agent: Exactly. And just to be clear, that's for the service itself. Your modem will stay the same—no rental fee there—and installation would be a one-time fee of $29.99 since we need to make sure everything's properly configured for the higher speeds.

Customer: Okay, I can do that. When would this take effect?

Agent: So I can get this scheduled for you right now. What does your availability look like? We have appointments tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM, or we could look at later this week if that works better.

Customer: Tomorrow? Um, let me think. Tomorrow's Tuesday, right? Yeah, I could do tomorrow afternoon, like after 1 PM?

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Let me get you on the books for tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Our technician will text you about an hour before they're in your area so you know what time to expect them. Does the number we have on file work for texts?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Excellent. So just to recap real quick, we're upgrading you to Fiber 500 at $99.99 monthly for 12 months, then $109.99 after that, with a one-time installation fee of $29.99. Your appointment is tomorrow between 1 and 5 PM. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for the help, Derek. I appreciate the loyalty discount too.

Agent: Hey, no problem at all! Thanks so much for sticking with us. You're gonna love the faster speeds, trust me. We really appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Thanks again!

Agent: Take care! (call ends)
