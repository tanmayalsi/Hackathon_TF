Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I've had your service for about three years now, and honestly, I'm just not getting the speeds I'm paying for anymore. I want to look into upgrading.

Agent: I appreciate you calling in about that. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Let me just pull up your account real quick here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, I'm getting that now. And just to confirm, is this for the service at... 428 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great, got it. So I'm looking at your account here, and I see you're currently on our Gig Plus plan at 500 Mbps download speeds. You mentioned you're not getting the speeds you're paying for—can you tell me a little bit about what you're experiencing?

Customer: Well, yeah, so I work from home, and I've got like three or four devices going pretty much constantly. My wife streams sometimes, and when that happens, everything just crawls. I thought 500 would be plenty, but it's... it's just not cutting it.

Agent: I totally understand. Working from home definitely changes the game when it comes to bandwidth needs. (pause) So here's the good news—we actually just rolled out our Gig Fiber 2 plan in your area, which gives you 2 gigabits per second. That's four times the speed you're currently getting.

Customer: Wait, seriously? Two gigs? Is that even... I mean, is that actually available at my address?

Agent: Let me check that for you. (typing sounds) Yes, I'm confirming right now that we have that available at your location. You're all set there. The Gig Fiber 2 is definitely going to handle multiple streams and work-from-home usage without any issues.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. But I have to ask—what's the price difference? I'm already paying like... (pause) I think it's around $89 a month right now?

Agent: You're right, you're at $89 for the Gig Plus. The Gig Fiber 2 would be $119 per month for the first 12 months, then it goes to $139 after that. (pause) But I actually have a promotion running right now through the end of the month. If you upgrade today, I can lock you in at $109 for the first year, and then it moves to $129 after that.

Customer: Hmm, so that's thirty bucks more a month... (pause) But I get four times the speed?

Agent: Exactly right. Four times the speed, which should completely eliminate those slowdown issues you're experiencing. And honestly, with everything going remote these days, it's a pretty solid investment.

Customer: Yeah, I mean... (pause) Do I need new equipment? Like, do I have to get a new modem or anything?

Agent: Great question. So the modem you have now is fine for speeds up to a gig, so technically it would work, but to really take advantage of those 2 gig speeds, I'd recommend our Gig Fiber 2 router, which is included in the upgrade at no extra charge. We'd ship that out to you, and the installation takes about 10 minutes. You'd just plug it in and restart your old modem.

Customer: Okay, okay. And how soon could that be installed?

Agent: (typing) Let me see what we have available... For your area, we could get a technician out there as early as tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we have some afternoon slots on Friday and Saturday. What works best with your schedule?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be perfect, actually.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) Let me get that locked in for you. So tomorrow, between 8 and noon, our technician will come out, drop off your new router, and get everything connected and tested. You'll be all set.

Customer: That's great. So just to make sure I have this straight—I'm going from 500 Mbps to 2 gigs, paying $109 a month for the first year, and the tech comes out tomorrow?

Agent: You've got it. And you'll get a confirmation email within the next hour with all the appointment details and a tracking number for your new equipment. Oh, and one more thing—there's no early termination fee on this upgrade, so you're locked in at that price, but you're not locked into a contract. You can change anytime after the promotional period.

Customer: That's perfect. That's really what I needed to hear. Thank you so much.

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that covers everything. I'm really excited to get this set up.

Agent: Awesome. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer for the past three years, and we really appreciate your business. You should be all set, and we'll see you tomorrow morning!

Customer: Sounds good. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day!
