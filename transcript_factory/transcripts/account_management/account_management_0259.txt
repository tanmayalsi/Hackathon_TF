Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My current plan is just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you being a loyal customer! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing your account. You're currently on our Fiber 100 plan at $59.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've got three kids, and they're all doing online school now, plus my wife streams... everything. Netflix, TikTok, YouTube, you name it. And when everyone's online at the same time, it just slows to a crawl. We're constantly getting buffering.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. A hundred megs doesn't stretch as far as it used to, especially with multiple users and streaming. What kind of speeds are you looking to upgrade to?

Customer: Well, I'm not really sure what I need, to be honest. What would you recommend?

Agent: (pause) Okay, so with three kids doing schoolwork and your wife streaming HD content, I'd say you're probably looking at our Fiber 500 plan at minimum. That would give you the bandwidth to handle simultaneous streaming and video conferencing without the buffering issues you're experiencing. That's $89.99 a month.

Customer: Hmm, five hundred megs... Is that, like, a big jump from what I have?

Agent: It's a significant upgrade, yeah. You'd be going from 100 to 500, so that's five times your current speed. But we also have our Fiber 1 Gig plan if you want even more headroom going forward. That's our top tier at $129.99 a month.

Customer: (pause) That's... quite a bit more expensive. What's the difference between the 500 and the gig?

Agent: Well, the 500 should handle your current needs really well, but the gig gives you future-proofing. As your family's internet demands grow, you won't run into speed issues for years. Plus, if you ever work from home or need to upload large files, that gigabit speed is noticeably faster. But honestly, based on what you've described, the 500 plan would probably be perfect for you.

Customer: Yeah, okay. So how much would the upgrade cost me right now? Any installation fees or anything?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our current promotions... Great news! Since you're an existing customer, I can waive the installation fee, which would normally be $99.99. And we're currently running a promotion where if you sign up for a 24-month agreement on the Fiber 500, we can lock you in at $79.99 per month for the first year, then it goes to the regular price after that.

Customer: Oh, that's better. So first year is eighty, second year is...?

Agent: Ninety dollars a month, yes. After the two-year agreement ends, you'd be month-to-month at our standard rate, which currently is $89.99.

Customer: Okay, and when could you guys get out here to install it? We're pretty busy this week, but maybe next week?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our installation calendar... What area are you in? I want to make sure I'm looking at the right service region.

Customer: We're in Portland. Like, the northeast side, off 82nd Avenue.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Alright, I'm seeing availability next Tuesday through Thursday of next week. We'd be looking at a four-hour window. Would any of those days work for you?

Customer: Um... Wednesday would be best for me. Morning would be great if that's available.

Agent: Let me see... Yes, we have an 8 AM to 12 PM slot available on Wednesday. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect.

Agent: Excellent. So just to confirm everything before I process this... You're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500, installation is waived, first year rate is $79.99 per month with a 24-month agreement. Technician will arrive Wednesday between 8 AM and noon. And I should mention, you'll need a compatible modem for the gigabit service—

Customer: Wait, do I need to buy a new modem?

Agent: The one you have now is probably older, so it might not be compatible with the speeds you'll be getting. We have two options: you can purchase one outright for $99, or we can include a modem rental in your bill for $12 a month.

Customer: How much is that over two years?

Agent: (pause) The rental would be $288 over 24 months, so the purchase would actually save you money in the long run.

Customer: Yeah, let's just do the purchase then. Get it over with.

Agent: Smart choice. I'm going to add that to your order. So your total will be $79.99 for the first month, which includes the modem—no, actually, let me recalculate... The modem will be a one-time charge of $99.99, and then your monthly service starts at $79.99. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that works. Do I need to do anything to prepare for Wednesday?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home to let the technician in. They'll handle everything else. They might need to run a line outside if it's not already there, so just be aware of that. And have your current router accessible because they'll help with setup. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for all the help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and I think you're going to be really happy with that speed upgrade. You should see a much better experience with everything. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too!

Agent: Bye now.
