Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current speeds are just... they're not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've got some great options available. Before I pull up your account, can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me just... there we go. I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've had it for, I dunno, maybe three years now? And it was fine for a while, but now I'm working from home more, and my partner's streaming stuff, and the internet just gets... it bogs down, you know?

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. Fiber 100 is good for light usage, but once you've got multiple devices streaming or if you're doing video calls regularly, you definitely feel the difference. How many devices are you typically using at the same time?

Customer: Oh, probably like... four or five? I've got my work laptop, my partner's got their phone, we usually have the TV going...

Agent: Right, yeah, you'll definitely benefit from an upgrade. So we have a few options for you. You could go up to our Fiber 300 plan, which would be a significant jump in speed. Or if you want to future-proof yourself a bit more, we've got Fiber 500, which is fantastic if you're doing a lot of video conferencing or uploads.

Customer: What's the price difference? I mean, I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so let me see what promotions we have running right now. (typing sounds) You're in luck actually. For existing customers upgrading their service, we're running a special this month. Your Fiber 100 is currently... let me see here... $59.99 a month, right?

Customer: Sounds about right, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. So if you upgrade to Fiber 300, it would be $79.99 a month for the first year, and then it adjusts to $89.99 after that. And the Fiber 500 would be $99.99 for the first year, then $109.99 after.

Customer: Hmm, okay. Is there like... a contract or anything? I'm always worried about getting locked in.

Agent: Great question. So with our current promotion, there's no contract required. You can upgrade month-to-month if you'd like. However, if you do sign a two-year agreement, I can actually knock an additional $10 off your first year price.

Customer: So the 300 would be $69.99?

Agent: Exactly, yes. For the first twelve months.

Customer: (pause) And you said the speeds go from 100 to 300?

Agent: That's right. Fiber 300 offers download speeds up to 300 megabits per second, compared to your current 100. And upload speeds increase significantly too, which is especially helpful for video calls or uploading files for work.

Customer: I mean, that would definitely help. Let me think about this for a second. My laptop's pretty old though—would it even handle those speeds? Like, do I need new equipment?

Agent: That's a smart question. So the modem we'd provide handles up to Gigabit speeds, so you're completely covered there. Your laptop should be absolutely fine. The main thing to note is that your WiFi router might be a factor. If your router is older, it might not distribute those speeds as efficiently throughout your house.

Customer: Oh, okay. I do have an older router, actually. Like, a Netgear from maybe 2015 or so.

Agent: Yeah, so we'd definitely recommend upgrading that. We can provide you with one of our newer mesh WiFi systems for... (typing sounds) we can do that for $99 upfront, or we can add it to your bill for about $10 a month over the next 12 months instead.

Customer: Hmm, I think I'd rather just buy it outright. That seems simpler.

Agent: Perfect. So to recap what we're looking at—upgrade to Fiber 300 at $69.99 a month with a two-year agreement, plus the mesh WiFi system for $99 one-time. Does that sound good?

Customer: Yeah, actually, that sounds pretty good. Let's do it. Oh, but when would I be able to get this? Like, how long would it take?

Agent: Great! So let me just confirm the details here. (typing sounds) We have availability in your area starting next Tuesday. We'd send a technician out between 8 AM and 5 PM. Is that window workable for you?

Customer: Tuesday works. I can make that happen.

Agent: Excellent. So they'll come out, install the new modem and the mesh system, and get everything configured. It typically takes about an hour. During that time, you'll have a brief period where your service goes down—usually just five or ten minutes while we make the switch over.

Customer: Okay, that's fine. Um, and the price increase—will there be any other fees or anything?

Agent: Let me make sure there's nothing I'm missing. (pause) There is a one-time installation fee of $99 that would normally apply, but with this promotion it's actually waived. So you're just looking at the modem cost and the monthly service charge.

Customer: Oh nice, okay. And that price locks in for the first year?

Agent: Yes, exactly. The $69.99 is guaranteed for 12 months from your switch date. After that, it'll go to the regular rate of $89.99 a month unless you have another promotion running at that time.

Customer: Sounds good. Go ahead and set it up.

Agent: Perfect! I'm going to process this upgrade for you now. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got everything here. Your new service starts on Tuesday, August 13th. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details, the technician's information, and tracking details. Is the email we have on file still 555-0147@email.com?

Customer: Uh, no actually. Can you update it? It's [inaudible]... no wait, it's jessica.martinez at gmail dot com.

Agent: (typing sounds) jessica.martinez at gmail, got it. M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z?

Customer: Yes, exactly.

Agent: Perfect. You should receive that confirmation within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Just to recap, our technician will be out Tuesday between 8 and 5. If you have any questions before then, just give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too!

Agent: Bye now!
