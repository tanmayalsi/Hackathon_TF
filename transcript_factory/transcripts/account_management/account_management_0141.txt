Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet plan. My speeds have been pretty slow lately and I'm working from home now, so I need something faster.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Just to get started, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 2841 Maple Drive in Portland?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Okay, so I see you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan at $59.99 a month. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it's been throttling like crazy, especially in the evenings. I'll be on a Zoom call and the connection just... it's not great.

Agent: I totally understand. Working from home definitely requires a reliable connection. The good news is we have some excellent options available at your location. Since you have fiber, you qualify for speeds up to our Fiber Gig plan. We also have Fiber 300 and Fiber 500 as mid-tier options. What kind of speeds do you think would work best for you?

Customer: Um, I'm not super tech-savvy, so... what would you recommend? How many people would be using it?

Agent: That's a great question. Right now it's just me and my husband, but he mostly just browses and streams Netflix. I'm the one doing video calls and uploading files for work.

Agent: Okay, so with two users and your work requirements, I'd recommend at least our Fiber 300 plan. That gives you 300 megabits per second download speeds, which is more than enough for multiple video conferences, file uploads, and streaming simultaneously without any issues.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. How much more would that be?

Agent: (typing sounds) So Fiber 300 is $79.99 a month, which is $20 more than what you're currently paying. However, we do have a promotional rate right now. If you commit to a one-year agreement, we can get you Fiber 300 for $69.99 a month for the first 12 months, and then it goes to the standard rate after that.

Customer: Oh, that's better. And how long would it take to get that switched over?

Agent: Great question. Since you already have our fiber infrastructure at your location, it's just a plan change, so it should be active within 24 hours. You won't need a technician to come out or anything like that.

Customer: Oh nice, so I don't have to reschedule my work meetings?

Agent: Correct. You should be good to go by tomorrow afternoon at the latest. Most of the time it's even faster than that. (pause) Is there anything else I can help you with today? Do you have any questions about the new plan?

Customer: Um, let me think... No, I think that's everything. Oh wait, is there a contract or anything I need to sign?

Agent: Yes, as I mentioned, this promotional rate does require a one-year service agreement. I'll be sending you a confirmation email shortly with all the details, and you'll have an electronic copy of the agreement as well. You can review it there, and if you have any questions, you can always give us a call back.

Customer: Okay, sounds good.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just confirm everything with you before we wrap up. I'm upgrading your account from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, effective immediately. Your new monthly rate is $69.99 for the first 12 months, then $79.99 after that. This includes a one-year service agreement. You should see the speed improvements within 24 hours.

Customer: Yes, that's all correct.

Agent: Wonderful. Your confirmation number is 847-FRM-29015. I'd recommend keeping that in case you need to reference this upgrade for any reason. Is there a phone number where we can reach you if there are any issues with the upgrade?

Customer: It's 555-0147, same as the account.

Agent: Perfect, we have that on file. Well, thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks so much for your help, Marcus. I'm really looking forward to having faster internet.

Agent: You're very welcome. Enjoy those faster speeds, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye!

Agent: Goodbye!
