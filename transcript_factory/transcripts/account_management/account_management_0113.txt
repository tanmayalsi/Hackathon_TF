Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 meg plan, and honestly, I'm thinking about upgrading. My household is getting pretty crazy with streaming and work-from-home stuff, and I feel like we're hitting some speed bumps lately.

Agent: I completely understand. That's actually a pretty common situation we're seeing, especially with more people working remotely these days. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I grab your account information real quick? I'll just need your phone number or account number associated with the service.

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) ...it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this the account at 2341 Elm Street in Portland?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Awesome. Okay, so I'm pulling up your account now. I can see you've been with us for about two years on that 500 meg fiber plan. That's great. So tell me a little bit more about what you're experiencing. Are you noticing the slowdowns during specific times of day, or is it pretty consistent?

Customer: It's mostly in the evenings, you know? Like after five or six o'clock when everyone's home. My wife is doing video calls for work, the kids are streaming on their tablets, and then I'm trying to upload files for my job. I don't know, it just feels like everything's lagging.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. You're basically maxing out your bandwidth during peak hours with multiple high-demand activities happening simultaneously. You know, the good news is we have some really solid options that would handle that way better. We've got our 1 gig fiber plan, which is perfect for households like yours with multiple simultaneous users and devices.

Customer: Okay, 1 gig? How much more is that going to run me?

Agent: Good question. Let me pull up the pricing here. (typing sounds, pause) So right now, we're actually running a promotion on our gig plan. Your current rate is... looks like you're at $89.99 a month?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, so the 1 gig plan would normally be $129.99 a month, but because we have this current offer, I can get you in at $99.99 for the first 12 months, and then it goes to the standard rate after that. Plus, there's no installation fee waived for upgrades like yours.

Customer: Oh, that's not too bad actually. What about after the 12 months though?

Agent: So after the promotional period ends, it would move to our standard rate of $129.99. But here's the thing—when we get closer to that date, you can absolutely reach out, and we can look at what promotions we might have running at that time. Our customers usually have options.

Customer: Hmm, okay. And I'm not gonna need a tech out here to install anything different, right? It's just an upgrade to my existing setup?

Agent: Great question. So since you already have our fiber infrastructure to your house, we can actually do a remote configuration change on your modem and router. Most times, you won't need a technician visit. However... (pause) ...let me just check your equipment status here. (typing sounds) Okay, so you're running our standard router. For the gig speeds, I'd definitely recommend upgrading to our newer WiFi 6 router, which would really let you take full advantage of those speeds. That's another $10 a month.

Customer: So that's 110 a month then?

Agent: For the first 12 months with the equipment, yes—$99.99 for the service plus $10 for the router, so $109.99 total. After the promo period, it's $139.99 for the service and the router.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think that's worth it. When could we get that switched over?

Agent: Excellent. I'm really glad you're going to make this upgrade. It should make a huge difference in your household's experience. So I can actually process this right now, and we can have you upgraded by tomorrow. I'd just need to get a couple of pieces of information from you.

Customer: Tomorrow? Really?

Agent: Yeah, the beauty of fiber and upgrading existing customers is we can push a lot of these changes through the system pretty quick. New router would arrive in three to five business days, and in the meantime, you'll have the higher speeds active. Sound good?

Customer: That's awesome, yeah.

Agent: Perfect. I'll just need to confirm your email address for the order confirmation, and I'll ask you a couple of security questions to verify everything.

Customer: Okay, it's jeff.martinez85@email.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, Jeff. So let me just confirm I have that right—j-e-f-f dot m-a-r-t-i-n-e-z, the number 8-5, @email.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect.

Agent: Awesome. And just to verify the account, what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's Jeff Martinez.

Agent: Perfect. And what's the last four digits of the phone number associated with this account?

Customer: Uh, 0147.

Agent: (pause) Great, that all matches up. Jeff, I'm going to go ahead and process this upgrade for you right now. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm submitting the order to activate your new service tier and the WiFi 6 router. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. When should I expect to see a difference?

Agent: So the speed upgrade will be active by tomorrow—you might actually see it kick in tonight if the system processes quickly. Once you get that new router in the next few days and you swap it out, you'll really notice the full benefit. You're going to see much more consistent speeds, especially during those evening hours.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks so much, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jeff. I really appreciate your business, and we're excited to have you on the gig plan. If you have any issues or questions once everything is set up, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you.

Customer: Will do. Have a good one.

Agent: You too, Jeff. Take care!
