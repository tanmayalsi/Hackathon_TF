Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore. My household has kind of exploded with devices, and I'm looking to upgrade to something faster.

Agent: I totally understand. We've definitely seen a lot of customers needing more bandwidth these days. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, and what's the best last name to look this up under?

Customer: Rodriguez. R-O-D-R-I-G-U-E-Z.

Agent: (pause) Got it, Mr. Rodriguez. I'm seeing you've been with us for about two years on that 500 meg plan. Just out of curiosity, what kind of activities are you doing that's maxing out your current speeds? Just so I can recommend the right tier for you.

Customer: Well, my wife works from home now, she's got video conferences going on most of the day. And then my two kids are always streaming stuff, doing homework on the internet, gaming... it's just constant. Last week we had this huge lag issue during an important meeting, and my wife was really frustrated. I don't want that happening again.

Agent: Yeah, that's really common with multiple users. Video conferencing can be pretty bandwidth-intensive, especially if it's HD. (typing) So we have a couple options for you. We can bump you up to our gigabit plan, which is 1 gig down, 35 meg up. That would be a nice step up from where you are. Or, if you really want to future-proof yourself, we have our two-gig plan that's been getting really popular.

Customer: Wait, what's the difference between those two?

Agent: (typing) Right, good question. The gigabit plan is one thousand megabits down, and the two-gig is two thousand megabits down. So it's literally double the speed. For what you're describing with multiple work-from-home video calls and kids streaming, honestly, the one-gig would probably be perfect. The two-gig is more for people who are doing heavy 4K streaming, multiple gamers, that kind of thing.

Customer: Okay, and what would the pricing be? Like, what am I looking at?

Agent: (pause, typing) Let me see here... So your current plan is 79.99 a month, right? The gigabit plan would be $99.99 a month.

Customer: Oh wow, that's a $20 jump.

Agent: I know, it stings a little. But here's the thing—I actually have a promotion available right now. If you sign up for a two-year commitment, I can get you the gigabit plan for $89.99 a month for the first year. So it's only a ten-dollar increase for year one, and then it goes to the standard rate after that.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, two years is a pretty long commitment though...

Agent: I hear you. Alternatively, I can do the one-year promotional rate of $94.99 if you'd prefer shorter commitment. That gives you a little more flexibility.

Customer: Can I think about it? I mean, can you just tell me how soon I could get it installed if I went with the upgrade?

Agent: Absolutely. We actually have availability pretty quickly in your area. (typing) Looking at the calendar, we've got openings as early as this Friday or Saturday if you want to move fast. Otherwise, we've got slots throughout next week.

Customer: This Friday? That's pretty fast.

Agent: Yeah, we're usually pretty good about turnaround in your neighborhood. And just so you know, since you're already a customer, we wouldn't charge an installation fee. That would be waived.

Customer: Oh, that's nice. (pause) Okay, so let me talk it over with my wife real quick. Can I call you back, or...?

Agent: Of course, no problem at all. I can actually send you an email with all these details—the pricing, the speeds, everything we discussed—so you have it in writing. That way you and your wife can look it over together.

Customer: Yeah, that would be helpful actually.

Agent: Perfect. (typing) So I'm gonna send that to the email address we have on file, which is... (pause) rodriguez.maria@... is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. And Mr. Rodriguez, if you do decide to move forward, just give us a call back at this number, ask for the sales department, and they can get you all set up. Or you can chat with us online at frontier.com if you prefer.

Customer: Great, thanks Derek. I appreciate the help.

Agent: You got it. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we hope to get you that faster speed soon. Have a good one!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
