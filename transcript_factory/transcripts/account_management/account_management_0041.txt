Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Okay, and just to verify, is this for the service address on Maple Street in Portland?

Customer: Yes, that's the one.

Agent: Perfect, got it. So you're looking to upgrade your speeds. What plan are you currently on?

Customer: I think it's the 200 megabit plan? I've had it for... I dunno, maybe two years now?

Agent: (typing) Yes, I'm seeing you're on our Fiber 200 plan. That's been a solid plan. What's prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, or...?

Customer: Yeah, actually. I started working from home full-time about six months ago, and my wife works from home too now. Plus we have three kids doing remote school stuff. So basically everyone's streaming, video calling, all that. The connection just keeps getting bogged down.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, that's a lot of concurrent usage. I totally get it. (pause) Okay, so we have a couple of options for you. Our Fiber 400 plan would be double your current speeds, and then we also offer Fiber 1 Gig, which is our fastest option. Are you familiar with those?

Customer: Not really, no. What's the difference in price between what I'm paying now and those?

Agent: (typing) Alright, so your current plan is $89.99 a month. The Fiber 400 would be $119.99, and the Fiber 1 Gig is $149.99 a month.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) And what's included with those? Like, do I need a new modem or anything?

Agent: Great question. So with the Fiber 400, we'd send you out a new router at no charge—you just return your current one. The modem you have should be compatible, but we can always upgrade that too if needed. With the Gig plan, it's the same thing, but we'd actually recommend upgrading the modem for optimal performance. That would be $15 a month for the equipment lease, or you could purchase one outright for around $200.

Customer: Okay, okay. So... (pause) if I'm being honest, I'm not super tech-savvy. Which one would you recommend for my situation?

Agent: You know what, based on what you're telling me—with four people in the house, multiple video calls happening, streaming, schoolwork—I'd actually recommend the Fiber 400 to start. The 1 Gig is really overkill unless you're doing heavy gaming or content creation. The 400 should handle all of that really comfortably. You'll see a huge difference from the 200.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that sounds reasonable. So $120 a month?

Agent: $119.99, and that's actually... (typing) it looks like we're running a promotion right now where if you sign a two-year agreement, we can knock $20 off your first three months. So it'd be $99.99 for the first three months, then jump to the regular rate.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad. So how long does it take to upgrade? Do I have to schedule something?

Agent: So good news—because you're already a Fiber customer at that address, there's no installation fee and we don't need a technician to come out. We'll ship you the new equipment, and it should arrive within five to seven business days. Once you get it, it's pretty straightforward to set up. We'll email you instructions, or you can call our tech support if you need help.

Customer: Really? That's actually really easy. Can I do this today?

Agent: Absolutely. That's what I'm here for. (typing) So just to confirm everything—you want to upgrade to the Fiber 400 plan, with the two-year agreement?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good.

Agent: And you're good with keeping your current modem, or would you like us to send you a new one just to be safe?

Customer: Uh... I think the new one would be good. Since I'm upgrading anyway.

Agent: Perfect. So that'll add $15 a month for the lease, but honestly, I think it's worth the peace of mind. You'll have everything optimized. (pause) Okay, getting everything set up here. Your new plan is all active, and I'm scheduling the equipment shipment now. You should receive your new router and modem within five to seven business days. Is there a preferred delivery address?

Customer: No, just the service address is fine.

Agent: Got it. (typing) And just so you have everything, your new monthly bill will be $134.99—that's the $119.99 for the service plus the $15 for the modem. And remember, the first three months will be $99.99 due to that promotion.

Customer: Okay, perfect. Can I ask one more thing? Is there a phone number I can call if I have trouble setting it up when it arrives?

Agent: Of course. We have 24/7 technical support. The number will be on all the documentation that comes with your equipment, but it's 1-800-FRONTIER, then press 2 for technical support. They're really good about walking you through everything.

Customer: Great, thank you.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm really happy with this. Thanks for making it so easy.

Agent: Happy to do it. You're gonna really notice the difference with that extra speed. We appreciate your business, and thanks for being a Frontier customer. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Bye now.
