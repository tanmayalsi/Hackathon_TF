# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've had Frontier for like three years now, and I'm pretty happy, but my speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate that, and I'm glad you've been a loyal customer with us. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) hold on, let me find my bill here. Okay, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the account under the name Patricia Hernandez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Patricia. So you mentioned your current speeds aren't meeting your needs. What speeds are you on right now, and what kind of activities are you having trouble with?

Customer: Right now I'm on the, uh... the 100 megabit plan? And honestly, I work from home, so I'm doing a lot of Zoom calls, uploading files to the cloud, that sort of thing. My spouse is also streaming stuff in the background sometimes, and it just gets really slow and choppy.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. With two people online doing bandwidth-intensive activities, 100 megs can definitely get stretched thin. We actually have some great options that would be perfect for your situation. Let me pull up what's available at your address.

Customer: Okay, cool.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) So I'm showing that you're in a fiber-service area, which is excellent, Patricia. We have our Fiber 300 and Fiber 500 plans available to you. Those would be 300 and 500 megabits per second respectively.

Customer: Oh wow, that's a big jump. How much would that cost?

Agent: Well, let me break that down for you. The Fiber 300 plan is currently $79.99 per month for the first year, then it goes to $99.99. And the Fiber 500 plan is $99.99 per month for the first year, then $119.99 after that.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) So that's a pretty significant increase from what I'm paying now, right?

Agent: I understand. What is your current rate, if you don't mind me asking?

Customer: I think it's around $65 a month?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so yes, there would be an increase. However, I do have some promotional offers I can apply for you as a valued customer. For the Fiber 300, I could offer you $64.99 for the first 12 months, which would actually be less than what you're paying now, plus you get triple the speed.

Customer: Oh, really? That's not bad actually. What about the 500? Could you do something similar?

Agent: Let me see what I can do here. (pause) Yes, I can get you the Fiber 500 plan at $84.99 for the first year. That's a bit more of an investment, but you'd have significantly more headroom for all the activities you mentioned.

Customer: That's interesting. Can I ask, um, would I need to do anything on my end? Like, would a technician need to come out?

Agent: Great question. So since you're already a fiber customer, your line is already installed. However, you would need to upgrade your equipment. We'd typically schedule a technician to swap out your modem and router, which takes about 30 to 45 minutes. There's no additional service charge for that since you're upgrading with us.

Customer: Okay, that's good. How soon could you schedule that?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) I'm showing that we have availability this week actually. We have Thursday between 1 and 5 PM, or we have next Tuesday morning between 8 AM and noon. What works better for you?

Customer: Thursday would be good. Thursday afternoon.

Agent: Perfect. Thursday between 1 and 5 PM. And that's this coming Thursday?

Customer: Yes, this Thursday.

Agent: (typing sounds) Excellent. I've got that scheduled for you. Is the best number to reach you at the 555-0147?

Customer: Um, actually, my cell phone is better. It's 555-8203.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. I've updated that. So to confirm everything here, Patricia: We're upgrading you to the Fiber 500 plan at $84.99 per month for the first 12 months, then $119.99 after that. A technician will come to your home this Thursday between 1 and 5 PM to install new equipment. Is that all correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. Um, one more thing—do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure you have access to where your modem is currently located, and maybe have your router in an accessible place as well. The technician will take care of everything else. We'll also send you a confirmation email with the appointment details and the technician's contact information.

Customer: Great. I think that's everything.

Agent: Wonderful. Oh, one more thing—we do have a courtesy courtesy reminder system that will send you a text message the day before your appointment, just so you're not caught off guard.

Customer: Perfect, thank you.

Agent: My pleasure, Patricia. Your account has been updated, and you should see those changes take effect on your next billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Marcus. I really appreciate it.

Agent: Thank you so much for being a loyal Frontier customer, and thank you for choosing to upgrade with us. We really value your business. You should start seeing those faster speeds by next week. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!
