Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan, and honestly, I'm just not getting the speeds I need anymore. I work from home now, and my wife streams a lot, and it's just been... it's been lagging, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. Working from home and streaming can definitely eat up that bandwidth. (typing sounds) Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got it. So you've been with us for about three years on that 500 meg plan. That's great. And you're looking to upgrade to something faster?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. What do you have available? Like, what's the fastest you guys offer in my area?

Agent: Great question. So we have a couple of options for you. Our fastest plan in your area is actually our 2 gig fiber package, which is... I mean, it's pretty incredible for what you're doing.

Customer: Two gig? That seems like... isn't that overkill? (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) I get that a lot, actually. But with multiple people using the internet at the same time, especially with video conferencing and streaming, it's not as much as you'd think. But we also have our 1 gig plan, which is pretty popular with customers in your situation. That's definitely a step up from where you are now.

Customer: Okay, okay. And what's the pricing difference?

Agent: (pause) So your current plan is $89.99 a month, right? Our 1 gig plan would be $119.99 monthly, and the 2 gig is $149.99. But I do have some promotional pricing available for you as an existing customer.

Customer: Oh yeah? How much of a discount are we talking?

Agent: So if you upgrade today, I can get you into the 1 gig plan for $99.99 a month for the first twelve months. After that, it would go to the regular rate, but you'd be locked in at that price for a year.

Customer: (pause) That's... that's actually not bad. What about the 2 gig? Any deal on that?

Agent: (typing sounds) For the 2 gig, I can do $129.99 for the first year. And just so you know, both of these include our premium router at no extra charge, and we'd waive the installation fee for the upgrade.

Customer: Installation fee... is there usually one?

Agent: Yeah, normally it's $99, so that's a nice savings right there. (pause) I'd say based on what you mentioned—working from home and your wife streaming—the 1 gig plan is probably going to be more than enough for your needs, and it's a good balance for the price.

Customer: Yeah, I think I'm leaning toward the 1 gig. Can I ask... like, how quickly can you get someone out here to upgrade? I've had some issues with installation appointments taking forever.

Agent: (typing sounds) I actually have availability... let me see here. We can get a technician out to you on Saturday between 9 AM and 12 PM, or we have Wednesday afternoon if that works better for you?

Customer: This Saturday? Like in three days?

Agent: Yep, this coming Saturday. We're pretty good about scheduling these days.

Customer: (pause) You know what, Saturday works great. Morning is better for me.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) So I'm going to set up your appointment for Saturday from 9 to noon. The tech will handle everything—they'll upgrade the line, install the new router, and run a speed test to make sure you're getting that full 1 gig. Should take about an hour, hour and a half tops.

Customer: Sounds good. And just to confirm, I'm not paying anything for the router or installation?

Agent: Correct. Those are both waived with this promotion. You'll just see the new rate on your next bill. And hey, you should notice a pretty significant difference right away once we get you upgraded.

Customer: Great, great. And that promotional rate, that's locked in for a year, right?

Agent: For a full twelve months, yes. After that, it would be $129.99, but you'd have plenty of time before then if you wanted to review other options or we could revisit your plan.

Customer: Okay, I think that's everything. Do I need to do anything before Saturday?

Agent: Nope, just make sure someone's home to let the technician in. They'll have all your information and everything they need. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details—your appointment window, what to expect, and the technician's phone number.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Thanks for calling Frontier. Have a great day!
