Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. My current speed just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Just to get started, can I have your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment while I pull that up... Great, I've got you here. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. A hundred megs down, right?

Agent: Exactly. So what's prompting the upgrade? Are you doing a lot of streaming, working from home, or...?

Customer: A bit of both, actually. I've been working from home three days a week, and we just got a bunch of smart home stuff set up. Plus my wife streams a lot, and honestly, when I'm uploading videos for work, everything just... slows down. It's frustrating.

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally understand. Uploads can be especially demanding. So you need something with better speeds overall, and it sounds like upload speed is important to you too?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. What would you recommend?

Agent: (pause) Well, depending on your needs, we have a few options. Our Fiber 300 plan gives you 300 Mbps download and 20 Mbps upload, which would be a significant jump. Then we have Fiber 500 with 500 down and 25 up. And if you really want to future-proof yourself, there's our Fiber Gig plan—that's 1 gigabit download and 50 Mbps upload.

Customer: Wow, okay. How much more would that be? I don't want to go crazy with the bill, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. So you're currently paying... (typing sounds) looks like $59.99 a month for the Fiber 100. The Fiber 300 would be $79.99, the 500 is $99.99, and the Gigabit is $129.99. But I should mention we have a current promotion running.

Customer: Oh yeah? What kind of promotion?

Agent: Right now, if you upgrade to either the Fiber 500 or Fiber Gig plan, we're offering the first three months at fifty percent off. So you'd be looking at $49.99 for Fiber 500 or $64.99 for Fiber Gig, just for those first three months.

Customer: That's pretty good. (pause) What about the 300? Does that qualify?

Agent: Unfortunately the promotion is only for the 500 and Gig tiers right now. But honestly, if you're dealing with upload issues and multiple people streaming, I'd really recommend at least considering the 500. It's a much more solid foundation, especially if you're going to keep adding more connected devices.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that makes sense. So with the 500, I'd be at fifty bucks for three months, then it goes to a hundred a month?

Agent: That's correct, yes. Then your regular rate would be $99.99 per month after the promotional period ends.

Customer: Okay, and... is there any, like, installation fee or anything?

Agent: Great question. Since you're already a fiber customer, we wouldn't need to do any new line installation. We'd just need to send a technician to swap out your gateway—that's the modem and router combo—and reconfigure things on our end. There's no installation fee for that service call.

Customer: Oh nice, so I wouldn't be without internet?

Agent: The technician would get you back up and running same day. It usually takes about thirty to forty-five minutes, so you'd have maybe a short window where things are offline, but nothing too bad.

Customer: Alright, I think that sounds good. When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability... What area are you in?

Customer: Uh, the Millbrook neighborhood, east side.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm looking at our schedule and we have availability next Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday. Would any of those work for you?

Customer: Let me think... (pause) Saturday would be easier. I'm working from home during the week and don't want to miss anything.

Agent: Saturday works great. Do you have a preference between morning or afternoon?

Customer: Morning's better. Like, before noon if possible.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got an 8 AM to 10 AM window available this Saturday. Does that work?

Customer: Perfect, yeah, that's great.

Agent: Awesome! And just to confirm the details here—we're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500. You'll be locked in at the promotional rate of $49.99 for the first three months, then your regular rate of $99.99 after that. The technician will arrive Saturday morning between 8 and 10 AM. Does all of that sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's all good. So I'll just be getting an email or something to confirm?

Agent: You'll get both an email and a text message with all the appointment details, including the technician's name and a phone number to call if you need to reschedule or have any questions before Saturday.

Customer: Great, great. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope, you're all set on your end. Just make sure someone's home Saturday morning and we'll take care of the rest. Oh, and one more thing—you might notice a brief bump in your bill this month since we're prorating the service change, but everything should settle into the promotional rate next month.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. Thanks so much, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your loyalty as a long-time customer. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. You've been really helpful.

Agent: Perfect! Have a great day, and I look forward to getting you that faster service. Bye now!

Customer: Thanks, bye!
