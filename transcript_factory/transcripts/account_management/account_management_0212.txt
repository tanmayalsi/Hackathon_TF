Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm seeing you're currently on our 100 megabit plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I work from home now, and with video calls and everything, it's just not fast enough. Plus my wife streams shows in the evenings, and we're constantly running into issues.

Agent: I totally understand. We've definitely seen that more often, especially with remote work becoming so common. So what kind of speeds are you looking at? Are you interested in our 300 meg plan, or would you want to go all the way up to our gigabit service?

Customer: What's the difference in price? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: Good question. (typing sounds) So your current plan is $64.99 a month. Our 300 megabit plan would bring you up to $79.99, and then our 1 gigabit plan is $99.99 per month.

Customer: Wow, okay, that's... that's a bit more than I was expecting. (pause) How much faster is the gig plan compared to the 300?

Agent: So the 300 meg plan would give you about three times the speed of what you have now, which is really solid for most households. The gigabit plan is roughly three and a half times faster than that. The thing is, if you're doing video conferencing and streaming simultaneously, the 300 meg option would probably handle that without any issues. The gig plan is more if you've got a bunch of people in your household all doing bandwidth-heavy stuff at the same time.

Customer: There's just two of us, so... I think 300 sounds like it would be enough.

Agent: Great! That should work really well for your situation. And the good news is I can offer you a promotion right now. If you upgrade today, I can waive your installation fee—that's usually $99—and we can lock in that $79.99 rate for your first year.

Customer: Oh, really? Yeah, that's helpful. What happens after the first year?

Agent: After 12 months, it would go to the standard rate, which is currently $89.99, but honestly, you never know with promotions—we run new ones all the time. You'd be free to call back and see what we can do for you then.

Customer: (pause) Alright, that sounds fair. And when could you get this set up?

Agent: Let me check our availability for you. (typing sounds) What's your address again?

Customer: It's 427 Maple Street, apartment 3B, in Portland.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up our schedule... it looks like we have availability this Thursday between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could do Friday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Friday afternoon is better. I'm working from home Thursday.

Agent: Perfect, Friday afternoon it is. (typing sounds) So I've got you scheduled for Friday, March 15th, between 1 and 5 PM. One of our technicians will come out and upgrade your modem and make sure everything's properly configured for the faster speeds. The appointment should take about an hour.

Customer: Do I need to do anything to prepare, or...?

Agent: Nope, just make sure someone's home to let the technician in. They'll handle everything else. You'll keep your same phone number and email associated with the account—nothing changes there.

Customer: Great, that's good to know.

Agent: (pause) And just so I have everything correct, I'm showing the upgrade to 300 megabit service at $79.99 per month for the first year with waived installation, and we have your technician appointment for Friday from 1 to 5 PM. Does all of that sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect.

Agent: Excellent! I'm going to send you a confirmation email to the address on file, and you'll get a text reminder the day before your appointment with the technician's contact information. Is that the best number to reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, 555-0147, that's my cell.

Agent: Perfect. And Derek here—just so you know, if you have any issues after the upgrade or if you want to check your speeds, you can always reach out to us. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Cool, I appreciate it. This should make things a lot smoother.

Agent: I'm sure it will! Thanks so much for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see you Friday. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, Derek, you too!

Agent: (background noise fades) Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Goodbye.
