Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet service. I've had the basic plan for a couple years now, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've got some great options available. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 50 plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. My speeds have been okay, but my daughter just started college and she's doing classes from home, and we've got like three other people working from home now too. So we're all trying to stream and video conference at the same time, and it's just... it's not working anymore.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, I hear that all the time. So what speeds are you looking for? Are you thinking something in the 100 range, or would you want to go higher?

Customer: I'm not really sure what I need, to be honest. What would you recommend?

Agent: Well, the good news is that Frontier Fiber is scalable, so we've got options. (pause) For a household with multiple people working and streaming simultaneously, I'd typically recommend at least our Fiber 200 plan. That gives you up to 200 megabits per second. But if you want to be really future-proofed, our Fiber 400 plan is becoming really popular.

Customer: Okay, and how much more would that be? I'm on the... I think it's $79 a month right now?

Agent: (typing) Yeah, $79.99 for the Fiber 50. So the Fiber 200 would be $99.99 a month, and the Fiber 400 is $129.99. (pause) Now, I should mention we actually have a promotion running right now. If you upgrade to Fiber 200 or higher, we can lock you in at the promotional rate for the first 12 months.

Customer: Oh, really? So how much would that be?

Agent: The Fiber 200 would be $89.99 for the first year, and then it goes to the regular price after that. And if you do the Fiber 400, that would be $119.99 for the first 12 months.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, that's not bad actually. I think the 200 sounds like it might be enough. How long would it take to get that set up?

Agent: Great choice. So let me check availability in your area first. (typing sounds) One moment... (pause) Okay, so the good news is you're already on our fiber network, so this is just a service upgrade. We wouldn't need to do any installation work. We can actually process this over the phone, and the changes would take effect within 24 to 48 hours.

Customer: Oh wow, so I don't need anyone to come out?

Agent: Nope, not at all. Since you're already connected, we can just push the upgrade remotely. Your modem might reboot once or twice, but that's it. You should see those speeds right away.

Customer: That's awesome. Okay, yeah, let's do the Fiber 200.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to set you up with the Fiber 200 plan at $89.99 per month for the first 12 months, and then $99.99 after that. (typing) Is there anything else I can add to your account today? We also have a really popular premium TV package, or I could talk to you about our phone service if you're interested.

Customer: No, no... just the internet. That's really all I need right now.

Agent: Understood. (pause) Okay, so I've got everything here. Just to confirm before we finalize this—is the service address still 412 Maple Street, Apartment 3B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: And your billing phone number is still 555-0847?

Customer: Yep.

Agent: Great. (typing) Alright, you're all set. I'm sending a confirmation email to [inaudible]@email.com. You should see that in the next few minutes. It'll have all the details of your new plan and what to expect over the next 48 hours.

Customer: Okay, perfect. And just to make sure—I don't have to do anything on my end, right?

Agent: That's correct. We're handling everything. Your modem will reboot automatically, probably sometime in the next day or two, and you'll notice that speed boost pretty much immediately.

Customer: Excellent. Well, thank you so much, Marcus. I really appreciate your help.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I'm really glad we could help you out today. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

Customer: No, that's everything. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and enjoy your new speeds!
