Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I've had your service for about three years now and I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I work from home now, and it's just... it's been buffering a lot when I'm on video calls. My partner streams in the other room, and it just seems like we need more bandwidth or whatever.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. Video conferencing and streaming simultaneously can definitely push those speeds. So Fiber 100 gives you around 100 megabits per second, which is good, but with multiple users and heavy usage, I can see why you'd want to bump up. What kind of speeds were you thinking about?

Customer: Um, I'm not totally sure? What do you have available?

Agent: Great question. So in your area, we have a few options. We can go up to Fiber 200, which doubles your speed to 200 megs. That's pretty popular with work-from-home customers. Then we also have Fiber 400, which is our higher tier, and Fiber Gig for our top-of-the-line option.

Customer: Okay, so... what's the price difference? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (pause) So your current Fiber 100 is $79.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. Maybe? (laughs)

Agent: (chuckles) Let me see what promotional pricing I can offer you. Because you've been a loyal customer for three years, you definitely qualify for our loyalty offers. Fiber 200 would be $99.99 for the first year, then it goes to $119.99 after that. But honestly, for just $20 more right now, that's pretty solid.

Customer: Okay, and the 400?

Agent: Fiber 400 would be $129.99 for your first year, then $149.99 after. That's double the speed of what you're getting now. And then Fiber Gig is our premium option at $149.99 intro, going to $169.99 after year one.

Customer: Wow, okay. So what would you recommend for... like, working from home and one other person streaming?

Agent: Honestly? (typing sounds) I'd say Fiber 200 is probably your sweet spot. That 200 megs gives you plenty of headroom for video conferencing while someone else streams. Fiber 400 is great if you think you might add more devices or want that extra buffer, but for two users, 200 is really solid. Plus you're saving a bit of money compared to the higher tiers.

Customer: Yeah, that sounds... I think that makes sense. How quickly can you get me switched over?

Agent: So here's the good news – you already have our Fiber infrastructure at your location, which is awesome. We can schedule a technician visit to make sure everything's properly configured for the upgrade. It typically takes about 24 to 48 hours to get you scheduled. The technician visit is usually about an hour, and there's no service disruption during the installation.

Customer: Oh, do I have to take time off work? That's kind of annoying.

Agent: (sympathetic tone) I know, I hear you. The good news is, a lot of our customers schedule it for early morning, like between 8 and 10 AM, so it's not too intrusive. We can also do afternoon windows. What day works best for you?

Customer: Um, probably this Friday? Morning is better, like before noon.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability... Okay, so I've got an 8 to 10 AM slot available this Friday. Does that work?

Customer: Perfect, yeah, that works.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) All right, so I'm scheduling you for Friday, this Friday, between 8 and 10 AM. Your technician will arrive with your new modem and equipment. Now, let me just confirm – is there anything else you need before we wrap up? Any questions about the service?

Customer: Um, will I need to do anything? Like, restart my router or anything?

Agent: Good question. The technician will handle all of that. They'll install the new hardware, test everything, make sure all your speeds are where they should be, and they'll walk you through anything you need to know. It's pretty hands-off for you.

Customer: Awesome. And when does this go into effect? Like, do I start paying the new rate on Friday?

Agent: Great question. So the rate change will go into effect on your next billing cycle, which based on your account is... (pause, typing) ...the 15th of next month. So you'll see the $99.99 charge starting then. You'll also receive a confirmation email with all the details, your technician's name, and a window for them to arrive on Friday.

Customer: Perfect. That's really helpful, Marcus. Thanks for walking me through all this.

Agent: You're very welcome! I'm glad we could get you set up. You're going to notice a huge difference with that Fiber 200. If you have any issues before or after the installation, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we really appreciate your business!

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
