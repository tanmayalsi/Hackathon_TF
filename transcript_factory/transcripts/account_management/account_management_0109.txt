Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've had your service for about three years now and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet plan. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our Fiber 500 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I mean, it was fine when I first got it, but now I'm working from home a lot more, and my partner streams constantly. We've got two kids doing online school stuff too, so... it's just gotten slower, you know?

Agent: Oh absolutely, I totally understand. Bandwidth needs definitely add up fast with multiple users. (pause) So with the Fiber 500, you're getting 500 megabits per second download and 100 up. What kind of speeds were you looking to upgrade to?

Customer: Honestly, I'm not really sure. What do you have available at my address? Is there something faster?

Agent: Great question. Let me check our availability for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so the good news is you're in one of our upgraded fiber zones, which means we have our Fiber Gig plan available. That's one gigabit per second download and 200 megabits upload. Definitely a major step up from what you have now.

Customer: Okay, so like double the download speed?

Agent: Exactly. It's twice as fast for downloads, and the upload is much better too, which is really helpful if you're working from home and doing video calls or uploading files. A lot of our customers in your situation see a huge difference.

Customer: That sounds pretty good. What's the pricing on that? And is there any installation fee or anything?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) So the Fiber Gig plan is $79.99 a month for the first twelve months, then it goes to $99.99 after that. Since you're an existing customer, I can waive the installation fee, which would normally be $99. And you know, because you've been with us for three years, I can also throw in a credit of $30 off your first month.

Customer: Oh nice! So that would be... what, around fifty bucks then for the first month?

Agent: Exactly. (pause) And just to confirm, we don't need to send a technician out unless you want us to. Since you already have our fiber equipment, we can just send you a new modem and do a remote activation. Takes about five minutes on your end.

Customer: Oh, so I don't have to wait around for someone? That's awesome.

Agent: Right? Much easier. (typing sounds) So I'm showing we can get the new modem shipped out to you... looks like it'll arrive in three to five business days, and then you just plug it in and we'll activate it remotely. You'll see the speed improvement pretty much immediately.

Customer: Perfect. And I'm locked in at the $79.99 for a year, right?

Agent: Yes sir, that's guaranteed for twelve months. After that, if you want to keep the service, it'll be the standard rate of $99.99. But you know, you can always call us back closer to the end of your contract if you want to look at other options. We usually have promotions available for existing customers.

Customer: Okay, that sounds fair. Let's do it then.

Agent: Awesome! (typing sounds) Let me just confirm a few things. We have your service address as 4521 Maple Drive, apartment 3B. Is that still correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And I'm going to send the modem to that address as well, and we'll use the phone number 555-0147 as the contact. (pause) Your new plan will go into effect tomorrow, so you'll start seeing those charges next billing cycle. And like I said, the modem should arrive in three to five business days.

Customer: Great. Do I need to do anything with my old modem?

Agent: Good question. When you get the new one, just keep the old one for now. We'll send you a prepaid shipping label via email, and you can drop it off at any UPS location. No rush on that though.

Customer: Easy enough. (pause) Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: (pause) I don't think so. Oh, actually, you might notice a slight improvement in your WiFi range with the new modem too. It's got our latest technology. But if you have any issues at all when you plug it in, just give us a call back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Sounds good. Thanks Derek, I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and thanks for upgrading with us today. You're gonna love those speeds. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Have a good day.

Agent: You too! Thanks for calling Frontier, and enjoy your faster internet!
