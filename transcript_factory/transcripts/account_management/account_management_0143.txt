Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet. I currently have the 100 meg plan and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. A lot of our customers find themselves in that situation, especially with more people working from home these days. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our 100 megabit plan. What kind of speeds are you looking to get? Are you streaming a lot, working from home, or...?

Customer: Oh, definitely all of that. I've got two kids doing school from home right now, my wife works remotely, and then there's like... Netflix, gaming, everything. The internet just tanks whenever multiple people are online. Like, yesterday my daughter couldn't even submit an assignment because the connection was so bad.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. With that kind of usage, I'd definitely recommend looking at our 400 megabit or maybe even our gig service. The 400 is a really popular option for families. It's gonna give you plenty of bandwidth for everyone to do their thing without running into those bottleneck issues.

Customer: Okay, so what's the pricing on that looking like?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, so for new service or upgrades, we're running a promotion right now. The 400 meg plan is normally $79.99 a month, but I can get you set up at $59.99 for the first twelve months, then it goes to the standard rate.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. And then what happens after the year is up?

Agent: After twelve months, it would go to the regular price, which is $79.99 a month. You'd have the option to re-evaluate at that point, and we sometimes have other promotions available. But I'm definitely required to let you know upfront what that rate change looks like.

Customer: Yeah, that's fair. Um... (hesitation) is there any way to get the gig service? Like, what would that run?

Agent: Great question. So our gig plan, that's our gigabit service, that's 1,000 megs. It's definitely the top-tier option. That's normally $119.99 a month, but with the same promotion, I can get that down to $89.99 for your first year.

Customer: (pause) That's a pretty big jump. What's the actual difference I'm gonna notice between the 400 and the gig? Like, is it worth an extra thirty bucks a month?

Agent: That's a smart question. Honestly, for most households, the 400 is going to be more than sufficient. The gig is really if you've got heavy usage—like if you're constantly uploading large files, running multiple video conferences simultaneously, that kind of thing. But with what you described, the 400 should handle everything pretty comfortably.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Let's go with the 400 then.

Agent: Excellent choice. (typing sounds) So I'm gonna set you up with the upgrade to our 400 megabit plan at $59.99 a month for the first twelve months. Now, I do need to let you know that there's no equipment change required. You'll be able to keep your current modem and router since they support those speeds. The upgrade should be effective... (typing sounds) ...within 24 to 48 hours. Have you experienced any issues with your current modem?

Customer: No, it's been pretty solid, actually.

Agent: Great. Then we should be all set there. Now, just to confirm—is this still the service address at 742 Elm Street?

Customer: Yep, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I've got everything processed here. You're all set for the upgrade. You should see a confirmation email within the next few minutes, and then once the upgrade is complete, you'll get another notification. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: Um, actually, one more thing. Is there any way to... like, what if I need to cancel this within the first year? Are there any early termination fees or anything?

Agent: [inaudible] —good question. So we do have a two-year service agreement with this promotion, and if you were to cancel before that term is up, there would be an early termination fee of $15 a month for the remaining months on the contract.

Customer: Oh, okay. So that'd be... (pause) ...that seems reasonable, I guess. Alright, I think I'm good.

Agent: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for upgrading with Frontier, and I'm sure you and your family are gonna really enjoy those faster speeds. If you have any issues during the upgrade process or if you need anything in the future, just give us a call back. We're available 24/7.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
