Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently subscribed to your 100 megabit plan, and honestly, I'm just not getting the speeds I need anymore. I work from home and I've got like three video calls going on at once sometimes, plus my wife streams, and... it's just becoming a problem.

Agent: I completely understand. Working from home can definitely require more bandwidth. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Okay, so I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years on the 100 Meg Fiber plan. That's great. And you're looking to upgrade to something with higher speeds?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. What options do you have available at my address?

Agent: (pause) Great question. So at your location, we can actually offer you up to 500 megabits per second with our Fiber service. We also have our gigabit option, which is one full gigabit per second if you really want to future-proof yourself.

Customer: Wow, okay. The 500 meg sounds like it'd probably be plenty. How much more would that be per month?

Agent: (typing sounds) So your current plan is $69.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: The 500 meg plan would be $99.99 per month, so that's about thirty dollars more. However, I'm actually looking at some promotional pricing we have available right now. If you upgrade today, I can get you the first six months at $79.99 a month instead of the regular price. That's a nice savings.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad. Um... and then it goes to regular price after that?

Agent: Exactly. So six months at $79.99, then it goes to the regular rate of $99.99. But I'll be honest with you, we often run promotions, so there's a good chance when you're coming up on that six-month mark, you could look into renewing your promotional rate.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. Would I need to do anything with equipment or anything like that?

Agent: (typing sounds) That's a good question. So you're already on Fiber, which is great. The modem you currently have should work fine with the upgraded speeds, so there shouldn't be any equipment changes necessary on your end. Our technicians can verify everything is set up correctly during the upgrade, but honestly, it should be pretty seamless.

Customer: Nice. That's convenient. And when could you actually make this change happen?

Agent: (pause) Let me check our availability. We typically can schedule upgrades within about 48 to 72 hours. (typing sounds) I'm looking at tomorrow afternoon or Friday morning if either of those works for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be perfect. What time are we talking?

Agent: We have a window between 1 PM and 5 PM available tomorrow. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect. I'll be home. Do I need to do anything to prepare or...?

Agent: No, nothing on your end really. Just make sure someone's home to let the technician in. It's usually pretty quick, maybe 15 to 20 minutes tops. They'll just verify the connection, make sure everything's running at the proper speeds, and you should be good to go.

Customer: Great. And I should still be able to use my internet while they're doing this, or...?

Agent: You know, there might be a brief moment where service drops, maybe just a couple seconds, but you shouldn't experience any real downtime. They'll handle it professionally.

Customer: Okay, cool. I think that's all I need to know. Let's do it.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) So just to confirm everything: We're upgrading your service to 500 megabits per second, effective tomorrow. Your promotional rate is $79.99 per month for the first six months, then $99.99 after that. We have you scheduled for tomorrow between 1 PM and 5 PM. Is that all correct?

Customer: Yes, that's perfect.

Agent: Excellent. I'm going to email you a confirmation with all these details, including the technician's information. You should receive that within the next few minutes. Your confirmation number is 847623. Do you have any other questions for me today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier Communications, and we really appreciate your business. Enjoy those faster speeds tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, have a good one.

Agent: You too. Take care!
