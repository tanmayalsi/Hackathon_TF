Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I currently have the 100 megabit plan, and I'm finding it's just... it's not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've been getting a lot of customers in that situation, especially with more people working from home these days. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing here you've been with us for about three years now on our 100 Mbps fiber plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. I signed up back in 2021.

Agent: Great. And just out of curiosity, what's prompting the upgrade? Are you streaming a lot, or...?

Customer: Well, my kids are doing remote learning now, and we've got like three devices going at once sometimes. My husband works from home too, and he's always on video calls. The internet just gets really laggy in the afternoons. It's frustrating.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. So with that kind of usage, I'd definitely recommend looking at our 500 or 1 gig plans. Those would give you way more headroom. What's your budget looking like? Are you open to different price points?

Customer: Um, I don't want to go too crazy, but I'm willing to pay a bit more if it actually solves the problem. What's the difference in price?

Agent: Good question. So right now, your 100 Mbps plan is $59.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yes, I think so. Maybe it's gone up a bit with taxes and everything, but around there.

Agent: Yeah, taxes and fees definitely add to it. So our 500 Mbps plan would be $89.99 a month for the first year, then $99.99 after that. And then we also have our 1 gig plan at $129.99 for the first year, $139.99 after. All of our fiber plans come with unlimited data, so you don't have to worry about that.

Customer: And you said the 500 would be better for what we're doing?

Agent: (pause) Honestly, for your situation—three people using the internet simultaneously, especially with video calls and remote learning—I'd recommend the 500 Mbps. That should handle everything without any issues. The 1 gig would be overkill unless you think you'll need it down the road, but 500 is a sweet spot for families like yours.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. What about the 1 gig though? Like, is there a big difference in actual performance?

Agent: Well, you won't really *feel* a huge difference in everyday use, to be honest with you. It's more if you're doing really data-heavy stuff—like if you're uploading large files regularly, or if you had like five or six people streaming 4K video at the same time. For your needs, 500 will be rock solid.

Customer: Alright, yeah, the 500 sounds good then. What would I need to do? Do I have to get new equipment or anything?

Agent: Great choice. (typing sounds) So the good news is your current modem supports up to gigabit speeds, so you should be able to keep using it. We won't need to send you any new hardware. It's really just a speed tier upgrade on the backend, so it's super simple.

Customer: Oh, that's convenient. When could it be activated?

Agent: It can be activated as soon as... let me see here... (pause) We can get you switched over as soon as tomorrow actually. We're not backed up right now, so that's lucky. Does tomorrow work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Yeah, that works. Will there be any downtime?

Agent: There will be a brief moment—maybe a minute or two—when we push the change through, but that should be it. Nothing too major. You might want to let your kids and husband know just in case they're online, but it'll be quick.

Customer: Okay, great. And what about... do I need to do anything on my end? Like restart the modem or anything?

Agent: You know what, after the change goes live, it wouldn't hurt to do a quick restart, just to make sure everything syncs properly. Just unplug it for thirty seconds, plug it back in. That usually clears up any minor hiccups.

Customer: Sure, I can do that. So how much is this going to cost me with everything?

Agent: So you'll see the upgrade to $89.99 a month for the first twelve months. Then after that first year, it'll be $99.99. That's before taxes and fees, so your bill will be a bit higher when those are added in, but that's the service cost itself.

Customer: Is there any promotion or... I don't know, anything else you can offer?

Agent: (pause) Let me check what we have available... (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm not seeing any additional promotions available on the 500 plan right now, but you are locked in at $89.99 for that first year, which is our standard promotional rate. That's a pretty good deal compared to regular pricing.

Customer: Alright, I'll take it. What do I need to do to get this set up?

Agent: Perfect! So what I'm gonna do is submit this upgrade request for you right now. (typing sounds) I'll need to confirm a couple things. Your service address is still 447 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And the best number to reach you at if we need to follow up is... the number you called from?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Awesome. (pause) Okay, so I've got everything submitted here. You should see this go live tomorrow between... (typing sounds) let's say between 6 AM and 2 PM. Sometime in that window. And like I said, there'll just be that quick moment of downtime.

Customer: Perfect. And I'll get an email or something confirming this?

Agent: You should get a confirmation email within the next few minutes, and then you'll get another notification when the upgrade is actually processed tomorrow. [inaudible] ...should see it in your account online too if you log in.

Customer: Great, thank you so much. This should really help with everything.

Agent: You're very welcome! I'm really glad we could get you sorted out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Awesome. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye!

Agent: Bye now!
