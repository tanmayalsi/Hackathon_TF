Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So I've had your fiber internet for about two years now, and I'm thinking it might be time to upgrade. My current plan is getting a little slow for what I need.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Before we get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 428 Oakwood Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Awesome. So I'm showing here that you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 300 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I think so. Honestly, I don't really pay attention to the speeds anymore, but yeah, I think it's the 300 one.

Agent: No problem. And what's prompting the upgrade today? Are you experiencing any issues with your current service, or is it more that you need faster speeds for something specific?

Customer: (pause) Well, I started working from home full-time about six months ago, and I've got multiple people on the network now—my wife's also home, and we've got two kids doing remote school stuff. It just feels like everything's getting buffered, you know? Pages take forever to load, and streaming is just... it's rough.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, I totally understand. That's actually really common, especially with multiple devices and video conferencing. Working from home definitely changes your needs. So what kind of speeds are you thinking you'd need? Are you looking at our 500 plan, or would you want to go even higher?

Customer: I'm not really sure what the difference is between them, to be honest. What would you recommend?

Agent: (typing sounds) So with four people on the network, including work-from-home video calls, I'd honestly suggest our Frontier Fiber 1 Gig plan. That gives you a full gigabit of speed, which is plenty of headroom for everything you're doing—video conferencing, streaming, kids doing school stuff all at once. The 500 plan would help, but you might still run into some congestion during peak times.

Customer: Okay, and how much more is that? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (pause) Let me pull up the current promotional pricing... So right now, we're running a special. Your 300 plan is probably around $64.99 a month?

Customer: Yeah, sounds about right.

Agent: And the 1 Gig plan is $89.99 a month for the first year with our current promotion. After that, it goes to $109.99. So it's an increase, but honestly, with what you're describing, it'll make a huge difference in your home experience.

Customer: Hmm, and what about the 500? You said that was an option too?

Agent: Right, so the 500 plan is $79.99 for the first year, then $99.99 after. So there's a ten-dollar difference between that and the Gig plan. It really depends on your comfort level with the budget and how much buffer you want.

Customer: (pause) You know what, let's go with the 1 Gig. If we're paying for it, I might as well get something that's actually going to work for us.

Agent: Excellent choice! You won't regret it. The upgrade is actually really seamless on the fiber network—we don't even need to send a technician out. We can push the upgrade remotely, and it should take effect pretty much immediately. You might experience a brief couple-second blip where your connection drops, but that's totally normal.

Customer: Oh nice, so I don't have to wait around for someone to come out?

Agent: Nope! (typing sounds) We can actually activate that for you today. Is there anything in particular that you'd like me to make note of on the account—any preferred timeframe for when you want this to go live?

Customer: Uh, no, sooner is better, honestly. Can you do it like... today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here... Yeah, I can schedule that for tonight after 10 PM, which is our standard window for remote upgrades. That way it won't interrupt anything you're doing during the day.

Customer: Perfect, that works great.

Agent: Awesome. So let me just confirm the details here. I'm upgrading your account from Fiber 300 to Fiber 1 Gig, effective tonight at 10 PM. Your new rate is $89.99 per month for the first 12 months, then $109.99 after that. And I'll need you to acknowledge that you've read through our terms and conditions...

Customer: (laughs) I'm not gonna read them, but yeah, I acknowledge.

Agent: (laughs) Fair enough, I appreciate the honesty. Most people don't, if I'm being real with you. Okay, so you should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all these details. Is the email on file still good? I'm showing [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, after the upgrade completes tonight, you might want to restart your router just to make sure everything's synced properly. It's not necessary, but it doesn't hurt.

Customer: Will do. Hey, one more thing—do I need a new modem or anything like that?

Agent: Great question. For the 1 Gig speeds, you will want to make sure you have a compatible modem. Are you currently using your own modem or our Frontier equipment?

Customer: I think it's yours? It's the white box they installed when we first set up service.

Agent: Okay, so that's likely our standard modem, which... (pause) unfortunately won't support gigabit speeds. But here's the good news—we can ship you an upgraded modem at no charge. It'll arrive within about three to five business days. You can either wait for that to arrive before you start seeing the full benefit of the upgrade, or you can start using it at your current speeds and then switch it over when the new modem gets there.

Customer: Oh, so the upgrade won't work until I get the new modem?

Agent: Well, the speeds will technically upgrade, but your modem will be the bottleneck, so you won't actually see the 1 Gig performance. So yeah, it's worth waiting or at least having the new one ready to go.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. Can you just ship that out today?

Agent: Absolutely. I can initiate that right now. (typing sounds) Looks like shipping is going to take about three to four business days, so you should have it by early next week. I'd recommend installing it then, and you'll be all set.

Customer: Great, I appreciate that.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for your help!

Agent: You got it! Thanks so much for choosing Frontier Communications, and welcome to the Fiber 1 Gig plan. You should start noticing a huge difference. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!
