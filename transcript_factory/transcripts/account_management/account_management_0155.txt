# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing here that you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine when I was living alone, but my girlfriend just moved in, and now we've got like... we're both working from home, she's streaming, I'm on Zoom calls all day, and it just... it keeps buffering and disconnecting.

Agent: Oh yeah, that's actually really common when you add another heavy user to the network. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking at? Are you thinking you want something faster, or are there specific activities that are causing the most issues?

Customer: Well, what do I have now, like 100 megabits?

Agent: Yes, exactly. You've got 100 megabits download.

Customer: Okay, so both of us working from home simultaneously needs way more than that. And she also likes to upload videos to her cloud storage, so... yeah. What do you guys offer?

Agent: Great question. So we have several options in your area. You could upgrade to our Fiber 200 plan, which doubles your speed to 200 megabits. Then we also have Fiber 500, which gives you 500 megabits, and our top tier is Fiber 1 Gig, which is one gigabit per second. (pause) For your situation with two people working from home, I'd probably recommend either the 500 or the 1 Gig plan. Those are going to handle multiple video calls, streaming, and file uploads without any problems.

Customer: Okay, and what's the pricing difference?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here. So your current plan is $79.99 a month. The Fiber 500 would be $129.99 a month, and the Fiber 1 Gig is $179.99 a month.

Customer: Whoa. That's... that's almost double for the Gig plan.

Agent: I understand it's a jump. But with the 1 Gig speed, you're really future-proofing yourself. You'll be able to handle anything you throw at it. Plus, um, you might actually qualify for a promotion. Let me check your account status here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so because you've been a loyal customer for... looks like four years... we can apply a loyalty discount. So I can get the Fiber 1 Gig plan down to $149.99 for the first twelve months.

Customer: Oh, that's better. But what about after twelve months?

Agent: After that, it'll go to the regular rate of $179.99, but you know, that's standard. And you can always give us a call back if you want to revisit your plan at that time.

Customer: Okay. And do I need a technician to come out, or can you just... I don't know, flip a switch or something?

Agent: (chuckling) I wish it were that easy. So here's the thing—your current equipment should actually support the Fiber 1 Gig speed, but I would recommend scheduling a technician visit just to make sure everything's properly configured. It usually takes about an hour. We have availability... let me see... we could do next Tuesday between 8 AM and noon, or Thursday afternoon after 2 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: Thursday afternoon works. What time exactly?

Agent: It'll be a window, so between 2 and 5 PM on Thursday. That way you have some flexibility.

Customer: Alright, that sounds good.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And just to confirm—is that a residential installation?

Customer: Yeah, it's our apartment.

Agent: Got it. And the technician will call you about thirty minutes before they arrive, okay?

Customer: Cool. Um, one more question—is there any kind of contract I need to sign, or...?

Agent: So our standard Fiber plans don't require a long-term contract. You'll be month-to-month after the promotional period. However, if you sign a two-year agreement, I can actually knock an additional $10 off your monthly rate. So it would be $139.99 for the first year instead.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. I don't really like being locked into contracts, honestly.

Agent: Totally understandable. A lot of customers feel the same way. The month-to-month gives you flexibility, so that's completely up to you.

Customer: Yeah, I'll stick with month-to-month then.

Agent: Perfect. So let me just recap what we've got set up here. You're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 1 Gig at $149.99 per month for the first twelve months, then $179.99 after that. Technician visit is scheduled for Thursday between 2 and 5 PM. The installation is free, and the technician will call ahead. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's great. Thank you.

Agent: Awesome. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all these details, including the technician's phone number. Is the email address we have on file still the best one to reach you?

Customer: Um, what email do you have?

Agent: It shows [inaudible]@gmail.com—is that still good?

Customer: Yes, that's still good.

Agent: Perfect. Well, I think we're all set! Your new service will activate on Thursday after the tech visit. You're going to notice a huge difference with the speed. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
