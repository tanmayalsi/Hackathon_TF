# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So I've been a customer for about... I think three years now? And I'm looking to upgrade my internet plan.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our Fiber 50 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it's been pretty good, but my work-from-home situation has changed. I've got like three people in the house now all streaming and working at the same time, and it's just... it's getting a little slow, you know?

Agent: Okay, I totally understand. That's actually really common right now. So we have a few options that might work better for you. Our Fiber 100 plan would be double your current speed, and then we also have Fiber 200 and Fiber 500 if you want even more capacity. (pause) What kind of activities are you mainly doing? Like, is it video conferencing, streaming...?

Customer: Mostly video calls and some streaming, yeah. My wife watches Netflix while I'm on Zoom calls, and my son's always doing something on his laptop too. So basically we need something that can handle all of that at once without everyone complaining.

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, I hear you. In that case, I'd probably recommend our Fiber 100 or Fiber 200 plan. The 100 would give you that 100 megabits per second, which is solid for what you're describing. But honestly, the Fiber 200 might be the sweet spot for three users simultaneously. It's only about fifteen dollars more per month than the 100.

Customer: Okay, so what would my bill look like? Like, ballpark?

Agent: Let me see what kind of promotions we have available for upgrades... (typing sounds) So if you go with the Fiber 200, we're actually running a promotion right now where you'd get the first three months at our standard rate, and then after that it's gonna be $79.99 a month. That includes the modem, and you won't have any equipment fees.

Customer: (pause) Okay... and what's the difference if I go with the Fiber 100?

Agent: The Fiber 100 would be $59.99 a month after the promotional period. So it's that twenty-dollar difference. The real question is whether double the speed is worth that to you, especially with the three users.

Customer: What's my current bill? I think it's like fifty something?

Agent: (typing sounds) Your current bill is $54.99 for the Fiber 50 plan. So upgrading to the 100 would only be five dollars more, and upgrading to the 200 would be twenty-five dollars more.

Customer: Hmm, that's not too bad actually. I think... I think I'll go with the 200. Better to have it and not need it, right?

Agent: (laughs) That's exactly right! You'll definitely notice the difference, especially during peak hours. Let me just get some information from you to process this upgrade. Is the service address still the same as what I have on file?

Customer: Yeah, 447 Maple Drive, apartment 3B.

Agent: Perfect. And we should be able to get you upgraded within the next two to three business days. We'll send a technician out to check everything and make sure your setup is optimized for the new speeds. Will someone be home during the day, or would you prefer a specific time window?

Customer: Um, let me think... (pause) Weekday mornings are probably best. Like before noon?

Agent: Great. I'll set that up for you. Just to confirm everything—you're upgrading from Fiber 50 to Fiber 200, the promotional rate applies to your first three months, and then it goes to $79.99 per month. You'll get an email confirmation shortly with all the details and the technician's appointment window.

Customer: Sounds good. Do I need to do anything on my end before they come?

Agent: Just make sure you have access to your modem and router—they're usually near your main internet hookup, right? The technician might need to take a look at those to make sure everything's configured properly. But they'll take care of most of it. You shouldn't need to do much.

Customer: Okay, perfect. Thanks for all the help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate the opportunity to upgrade your service. If you have any questions before the technician arrives, just give us a call back. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again!

Agent: Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
