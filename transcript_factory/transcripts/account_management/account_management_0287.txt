Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet service. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! I can definitely look into some upgrade options for you. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Sarah Chen.

Agent: Great, Sarah. Thanks for being a customer with us. So, tell me a little bit about what's going on with your current service. What speed are you on right now?

Customer: I think it's... I want to say 300 megabits? Or maybe 400? Honestly, I'm not totally sure. But basically, my kids are doing online school, I'm working from home, and we're all trying to use the internet at the same time. It's just been really slow and frustrating.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I totally understand. With multiple users streaming and doing video calls, 300 to 400 megs can definitely get stretched thin. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account here and you're currently on our Fiber 400 plan. That's our 400 megabit download speed.

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: Perfect. So we actually have a couple of excellent options for you. Our most popular upgrade would be our Fiber 1 Gig plan. That's one gigabit per second download speeds, so about two and a half times faster than what you have now. That's really great for households like yours with multiple users. We also have a Fiber 2 Gig option if you really want the absolute fastest speeds.

Customer: Hmm, okay. And what would that cost? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (chuckles) Totally fair. Let me get you some pricing. (typing sounds) So, the Fiber 1 Gig is currently $79.99 a month if you're on a two-year agreement. That would actually only be a $20 increase from what you're paying now. The Fiber 2 Gig is $99.99 a month with the same agreement.

Customer: So it's like... $20 more a month?

Agent: Yes, exactly. And honestly, for your situation with the work-from-home setup and the kids in school, the 1 Gig is going to make a huge difference. You'll see much faster downloads, uploads, and it handles multiple devices really well.

Customer: (pause) That actually doesn't sound too bad. Um, would there be any installation fees or anything like that?

Agent: Great question. So because you're already a Fiber customer with us, there wouldn't be any new installation fees. We'd just need to send a technician out to upgrade your equipment—that's completely free. The whole process usually takes less than an hour, and the technician will get everything set up and tested for you.

Customer: Oh, that's nice. When could they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. What days typically work best for you? Are you available on weekdays, or would a weekend be better?

Customer: Weekends would be better, honestly. Next Saturday?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see... yes, we have availability next Saturday between 9 AM and 12 PM, or we also have an afternoon slot from 1 to 4 PM.

Customer: The morning is better. 9 to 12.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) You're all set for next Saturday, December 14th between 9 and 12. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive. Does that number 555-0147 work for that call?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Excellent. So just to recap, we're upgrading you from Fiber 400 to Fiber 1 Gig at $79.99 a month. There's no installation fee, and your technician appointment is next Saturday morning. Are you good with all of that?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds great. So when would the new price kick in?

Agent: Great question. Your new rate would start on your next billing cycle, which looks like... (typing sounds) January 5th. So you'll have the upgraded service starting next Saturday, but the new pricing starts in January.

Customer: Okay, perfect.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today, Sarah?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you so much!

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
