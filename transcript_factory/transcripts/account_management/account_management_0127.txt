# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan just... it's not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got you here. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've had it for like... three years now? And honestly, it was great at first, but now with my kids doing remote learning and my wife working from home, we're all on video calls at the same time and everything just slows down to a crawl.

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally understand. A hundred megs used to be plenty, but with multiple devices and video conferencing, you're definitely going to feel the bandwidth squeeze. What kind of speeds are you looking at? Do you know how many people are typically using the connection at once?

Customer: Well, like I said, usually three or four of us. We've got the kids' Chromebooks for school, my wife's laptop, and I'm usually streaming or working too. And then my youngest is always trying to play video games on his Switch or whatever.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, that's a lot of concurrent usage. I'd definitely recommend moving you up to at least our Fiber 500 plan. That's gonna give you five times the speed, so you'll have plenty of headroom for all that activity. We also have our Fiber Gig plan if you want to be really future-proofed, but let me start with the 500 and see if that works for you.

Customer: Okay, um, how much more would that be? Like, what's the price difference?

Agent: (typing sounds) So your current plan is $59.99 a month, and the Fiber 500 would be $79.99 a month. So that's a twenty dollar increase. And I should mention we actually have a promotion running right now where if you sign a two-year agreement, I can lock you in at $69.99 for the first twelve months.

Customer: Oh, really? That's not too bad. What about... you mentioned the gig plan?

Agent: The Gig plan is $99.99 a month normally, but with the same two-year agreement, that would be $84.99 for the first year. It gives you up to one gigabit per second, which is honestly overkill for most households, but it's there if you want it.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. I don't think I need a whole gigabit. That seems like a lot. I think the 500 plan with the promotional rate sounds good. What was that price again?

Agent: Perfect choice. That's $69.99 a month for the first twelve months, then it goes to the regular $79.99 after that. And you'd be locked in for two years.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I can do that. Do I need a new modem or anything?

Agent: Great question. The Fiber 100 modem you have should actually work fine with the 500 plan, so you won't need to swap anything out. You might notice the speeds kick in right away once I process this upgrade on my end.

Customer: Oh, that's good. I was worried I'd have to mess with that stuff.

Agent: (typing sounds) Nope, all good. Let me just review everything for you real quick. We're upgrading your service from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500, two-year agreement, promotional rate of $69.99 for twelve months, then regular price after that. Your service address is still 448 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: (pause) Perfect. And just so you know, there's no installation fee for this upgrade since you're already a fiber customer. The new speeds should be active within the next few hours, sometimes sooner. You might want to restart your modem after a couple hours to make sure everything's running smoothly.

Customer: Okay, will do. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Um, just one thing. Since you're signing a new two-year agreement, if you wanted to upgrade again or make any changes during that period, there would be an early termination fee of $150. But I don't think you'll want to upgrade from the 500 plan anytime soon, so that shouldn't be an issue.

Customer: No, that sounds fine. This should be perfect for what we need.

Agent: Awesome. So I'm gonna go ahead and process this for you right now. (typing sounds) You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details of your new plan.

Customer: Great, I appreciate it.

Agent: Of course! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier Communications, and I'm sorry we have to let you go. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
