Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Marcus. So I've been a customer for, um, about three years now and I'm pretty happy with your service, but I'm thinking about upgrading my internet plan.

Agent: Oh, that's great to hear! I'm glad you've been satisfied with us. I'd be more than happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account first?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing an account under the name David Chen. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Excellent, David. So you're interested in upgrading your service. Can you tell me a little bit about what's prompting the upgrade? Are you looking for faster speeds, or is there something else?

Customer: Well, my family's been working from home a lot more since... you know, the whole pandemic thing. My wife's been remote, and now my kids are doing hybrid school, so we're streaming a lot more. Like, we'll have video calls going, Netflix running on the TV, and then someone's trying to do homework online and things just start slowing down, you know?

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally get that. (pause) So it sounds like you're looking for more bandwidth to handle multiple devices at once?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. What speeds are we talking about here? What would you recommend?

Agent: (typing sounds) So, looking at your account, you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan at $59.99 a month. That's 100 megabits per second download and 10 megs upload. For a household with multiple people streaming and working from home simultaneously, I'd actually recommend either our 300 meg or our Gig plan. The 300 is really solid for most families—that's $79.99 a month. But if you want more headroom and really future-proof your connection, the Gig plan—that's 1 gigabit per second—that's $89.99 right now with a promotion we're running.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so the 300 would be like... double what I have now?

Agent: That's right, David. You'd be going from 100 to 300 megabits per second. Honestly, for what you described—multiple video calls, streaming, and kids' schoolwork—that should handle it really comfortably.

Customer: And what's the difference between the 300 and the gig? Like, is it worth the extra ten bucks?

Agent: That's a good question. Um... (pause) the jump from 300 to 1000 megs is pretty significant, but whether it's worth it really depends on your usage. The 300 plan handles 4K streaming, multiple video conferences, and online gaming without issues. The Gig plan is more if you're doing a lot of large file transfers, like if you work with video production or something like that. For most households, 300 is the sweet spot. That said, if you think you might want to add more users or devices in the future...

Customer: No, I think 300 sounds good. We don't really need the crazy fast speeds. What else comes with the upgrade? Any equipment changes?

Agent: Good question. So your current equipment should actually work fine, but I can send out a new modem at no charge that's optimized for the faster speeds. It's actually newer hardware—the one you have is probably about three years old at this point—so it'll also just give you a little better WiFi coverage. Installation is free, and I can schedule a technician to come out, or if you're comfortable with it, we can just have them drop it off and you can do it yourself. Most people find it pretty straightforward.

Customer: (pause) How long does the install take if someone comes out?

Agent: Typically it's about 30 minutes to an hour. The tech will come, swap out the modem, test everything, make sure you're getting the speeds you're paying for, and then answer any questions you have.

Customer: I think I'd rather have someone come out. My wife's been having some WiFi issues in the back bedroom—it keeps dropping—so maybe they can help with that too?

Agent: Absolutely, yeah. The tech can definitely take a look at your setup and see if repositioning the modem or adding an extender might help. (pause) So just to confirm, you want to upgrade to the Fiber 300 plan at $79.99 a month, and you'd like a technician to come out and install the new equipment?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. When could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... (pause, longer pause) Okay, so looking at your area, we have availability... we have Thursday between 2 and 6 PM, or Friday morning between 8 AM and noon. What works better for you?

Customer: Friday morning is better. I can make that work.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to schedule you for Friday, March 15th between 8 AM and noon. You should receive a confirmation text and email with all the details, including the technician's name and a phone number in case you need to reach them. Is the phone number on file still the best way to reach you at home?

Customer: Um, actually, can you use my cell? It's 555-0163.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it, I'm updating that now. So you'll get the text on 555-0163. (pause) Alright, David, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Oh wait, one more thing—when does the price increase kick in? Like, am I locked in at $79.99 for a year or...?

Agent: Great question. So this promotional pricing of $79.99 is locked in for 12 months. After that, the standard rate would apply, but we can definitely talk about options before that expires. We usually have promotions running, and as a loyal customer you'd be eligible for retention offers as well.

Customer: Okay, cool. That's good to know. Thanks, Marcus, I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome, David! Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being such a great customer. You should be all set for Friday. If you have any questions before then, you can always reach us at 1-800-FRONTIER or check your account online. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks a lot.

Agent: Bye now!
