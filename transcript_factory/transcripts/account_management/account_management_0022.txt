Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I've been thinking about upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Before we get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, this is for the service at 2341 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great! So I'm looking here and I see you're currently on our Fiber 200 plan. Is that the service you're experiencing issues with, or...?

Customer: Well, it's not really issues, exactly. It's more like... I work from home now, and my whole family streams a lot. Netflix, YouTube, all that stuff. And honestly, the speeds have just been feeling pretty slow lately. I think we need more bandwidth.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. Yeah, working from home definitely changes things. Are you noticing buffering, or is it more when multiple people are online at the same time?

Customer: Both, I guess? Like, if my wife is watching something and I'm in a Zoom call, things get laggy. And our kids are doing online school, so... it's basically constant.

Agent: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so let me tell you what we have available in your area. Since you're already on our Fiber 200, which is great, I can definitely get you upgraded. We have our Fiber 500 plan, which would give you 500 Megabits per second download speeds. That's gonna be a huge jump for you. We also have our Fiber Gig plan if you want our top tier—that's up to 1 Gigabit per second.

Customer: Wow, okay. That Gig one sounds impressive, but... how much are we talking here?

Agent: Good question. So your current plan is $59.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, so the Fiber 500 would be $79.99 a month, and the Fiber Gig would be $99.99 a month. But here's the thing—we actually have a promotion running right now where if you commit to a two-year agreement, I can lock you in at $79.99 for the Fiber Gig plan for the first year.

Customer: (pause) Wait, really? So I could get the gigabit speed for eighty bucks a month for a year?

Agent: Exactly. And then it goes to $99.99 after that first year. But honestly, with a family doing what you're doing, the Gig plan is probably your best bet long-term. You won't run into speed issues.

Customer: That's actually... that's a really good deal. Um, what about equipment? Do I need new equipment or anything?

Agent: Great question. (typing sounds) So you'd need to upgrade your modem and router to handle those speeds. We can send you our Frontier Gateway device, which is a modem and WiFi router combo. That's typically a $99.99 equipment fee, but with this promotion, I can waive that for you as well.

Customer: Oh, nice! Okay, yeah, I think I want to do it. What's the process? How long does it take to get set up?

Agent: Perfect! So what I'll do is process the upgrade here for you. The equipment will ship out in the next one to two business days, and you should receive it within about five to seven business days. Installation is super simple—it's really just plug and play. We have online guides, and if you need help, you can always call us back.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. Oh, wait—will there be any downtime or anything when I switch?

Agent: That's a good question. There might be a very brief interruption—maybe a minute or two—when the service switches over, but nothing significant. You won't lose anything or anything like that.

Customer: Got it. And just to make sure, there's no contract penalty for upgrading from my current plan, right?

Agent: No, not at all. The two-year commitment starts fresh with this new plan, but upgrading doesn't trigger any early termination fees on your current service. You're all good there.

Customer: Awesome. Alright, let's do it.

Agent: Wonderful! Let me just pull up the order screen here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so to confirm everything—you're upgrading to Fiber Gig 1 Gigabit service, $79.99 per month for the first year, then $99.99 after that. Two-year agreement. Equipment fee waived. The gateway ships out tomorrow, should arrive within five to seven business days. Does all of that sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect. That's everything I wanted.

Agent: Excellent. And I'm sending you a confirmation email right now with all the details, your order number, and tracking information for your equipment. You'll get that within the next few minutes. Is the email address on file still [inaudible@example.com]?

Customer: Uh, it's actually changed. It's now sara.mitchell@gmail.com.

Agent: Perfect, let me update that for you. (typing sounds) Sara Mitchell, got it. I'm re-sending that confirmation now, so you should see it pop up in just a second.

Customer: Great, thank you so much!

Agent: You're very welcome! And just so you know, you can reach out to us anytime if you have questions about the service once it's installed. We're here 24/7. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm really happy with this. Thanks for explaining everything so clearly.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and enjoy those faster speeds! Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks again!

Agent: Bye now!
