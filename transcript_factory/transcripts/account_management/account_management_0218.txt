# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We'd love to help you get a faster connection. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account real quick?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here. One second... Okay, I'm seeing an account under the name Daniel Martinez. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Daniel. So you mentioned your current plan isn't meeting your needs. Can you tell me a little bit about what you're using the internet for? That'll help me recommend the right speed for you.

Customer: Well, my wife and I have been working from home a lot more since the pandemic, and we're both on video calls constantly. Plus, we have our kids streaming stuff, doing homework on their laptops... it just gets really slow, especially in the afternoons. Like, pages take forever to load and—

Agent: (interrupting) Yeah, that sounds frustrating. I hear that a lot, especially with multiple people using the connection at once. What speed are you currently on?

Customer: I think it's like 200 megabits? Something like that. I got it maybe two years ago.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so you're on our 200 Mbps plan. And just to clarify, are you experiencing actual slowdowns, or is it more that you're worried about capacity?

Customer: No, it's definitely actual slowdowns. Like, I'll be in a Zoom call and it'll just freeze up. And when the kids are doing their school stuff at the same time, forget about it. It's basically unusable.

Agent: Understood. So for your situation with multiple users streaming and video conferencing simultaneously, I'd definitely recommend moving up. We have a few options available in your area. You could go with our 400 Mbps plan, or if you want to future-proof yourself a bit, we have 800 Mbps, or even our Gig plan, which is 1 Gigabit per second.

Customer: (pause) Wow, okay. What's the price difference?

Agent: Good question. So your 200 Mbps plan is currently $79.99 a month. Our 400 Mbps would be $99.99. The 800 Mbps is $129.99, and the Gig is $149.99.

Customer: Okay, so 400 would be double the speed for about twenty bucks more?

Agent: Exactly. Yeah, I'd say for your situation—with the video conferencing and the household streaming—the 400 would probably solve most of your issues. That's a solid option. But honestly, at $149.99, the Gig plan is really popular with families like yours. It's future-proof for... well, basically anything you'd want to do with the internet.

Customer: (pause) Can I... is there any kind of deal or promotion going on? Like, do you have any discounts?

Agent: Great question. (typing sounds) Let me see what's available right now. Okay, so currently we're running a promotion where if you upgrade to the 400 Mbps or higher, we waive your installation fee, which normally would be $99.

Customer: Oh, that's good. So no installation charge?

Agent: Right, that waive would bring your first month down, and then you're looking at your regular monthly rate after that. And typically, installation takes anywhere from... (pause) usually one to two business days. We'd schedule an appointment with you.

Customer: Okay, and it's the same internet I have now, just faster? Like, I don't need new equipment or anything?

Agent: Good question. We would likely need to upgrade your modem and router to take full advantage of the faster speeds. So there would be new equipment, but that's included in the installation. Our tech would come out, set everything up, make sure you're getting the best performance.

Customer: Alright. And how long is the contract? Because I want to make sure I'm not locked in for like five years or something.

Agent: (chuckling) No, no, nothing like that. We offer month-to-month service, so you can cancel anytime without penalties. Although, if you do sign a two-year agreement, you'd get an additional $10 off per month.

Customer: Oh, really? So that would bring it down to $89.99 for the 400?

Agent: (pause) Actually, let me recalculate that. (typing sounds) Yeah, so normally the 400 Mbps is $99.99, and with the two-year contract, we can do $89.99. So you'd be saving ten dollars a month.

Customer: That's not bad actually. Um... (trailing off) what about taxes and fees? Is that included in those prices?

Agent: Great question—no, there will be taxes and standard fees on top of that. I can't give you the exact amount since it varies by location, but generally, you're looking at around fifteen to twenty percent additional depending on your area.

Customer: Okay, okay. (pause) I think I want to do the 400 Mbps with the two-year thing. Can you set that up now?

Agent: Absolutely, I can definitely do that for you. So just to confirm, you're looking at upgrading from 200 Mbps to 400 Mbps with a two-year agreement, which would be $89.99 per month after the promotional installation waive. And we'll get you on the schedule for installation within the next couple of days.

Customer: Yes, let's do it.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just verify some information to get you set up. Is the service address still the same—that would be 4872 Oakmont Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. And for the installation, would a weekday morning work best for you, or are you more of an afternoon person?

Customer: Um, probably afternoon is better. Like, after one o'clock.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so afternoon after one o'clock. And is that during the week, or would a weekend work?

Customer: Weekday is better. I work from home, so I'll actually be here.

Agent: Excellent. (pause) I'm going to check our installation calendar... Okay, so I'm showing availability this Thursday between 1 and 4 p.m., or Friday morning if that doesn't work. What would you prefer?

Customer: Thursday works. That's the 14th?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, Thursday the 14th between 1 and 4 p.m. Perfect. I'll get you scheduled. And we'll send you a confirmation email with all the details.

Customer: Great. Is there anything else I need to do to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure someone eighteen or older is home for the appointment. The tech will need access to your main electrical panel and the outside of your home to make sure we get the best connection. Takes about an hour total usually.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good.

Agent: Awesome, Daniel. Your upgrade is all set. You're going to be really happy with the speed difference, I think. Anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you Thursday. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
