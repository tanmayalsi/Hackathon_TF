# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with the service, but I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore, especially with my kids doing remote school and my wife working from home.

Agent: I completely understand. That's a pretty common situation we're seeing, especially these days. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got you here. (pause) So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan—that's 100 megabits per second download. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was great for a while, but when everyone's home and streaming or uploading files for work, it just... it bogs down, you know?

Agent: Absolutely. Yeah, that makes total sense. So what kind of speeds are you thinking you'd need? Are you looking to just go up a tier or two, or...?

Customer: Well, I'm not really sure. What do you have available in my area? I don't want to overpay for something I don't need, but I definitely need something faster.

Agent: That's a smart approach. Let me check what we can offer at your address. (pause) (typing sounds) Great news—you're in one of our fully upgraded fiber areas, so you've got some really solid options. We can upgrade you to our Fiber 300 plan at 300 megabits per second, or if you want to go even higher, we have our Fiber Gig plan, which is one gigabit per second. That's 1000 megabits.

Customer: Wow, okay. What's the difference in price between those two?

Agent: Good question. So your current plan is $79.99 a month, right? (pause) The Fiber 300 would be $119.99 per month, and the Fiber Gig would be $149.99 per month.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so that's about $40 to $70 more per month. Hmm. Is there any promotional pricing or anything like that?

Agent: Absolutely. Actually, you're in luck. Since you're an existing customer in good standing—and I'm seeing you've been with us for over three years—I can offer you a promotional rate. For the Fiber 300, I can get you that for $99.99 for the first twelve months, and then it goes to the regular rate after that. And for the Fiber Gig, I can do $129.99 for the first year.

Customer: Oh, that's better. (pause) Okay, so what's the difference really gonna be for me? Like, practically speaking? The Fiber 300 versus the Gig?

Agent: Great question. So with the Fiber 300, you're getting three times your current speed, which honestly should handle most situations—multiple video calls, streaming, some gaming, all that happening at the same time. The Fiber Gig, though... (pause) that's really for power users. If you've got, like, large file transfers for work, if you're backing up a lot of data to the cloud, or if you're a serious gamer or content creator, that's where the Gig really shines. But for families with remote work and school, honestly, the 300 usually does the trick.

Customer: Okay, that's helpful. I think the Fiber 300 sounds like it would probably be enough for us. Can I ask... is the installation gonna cost anything? And how soon can you get someone out here?

Agent: So installation is completely free for existing customers upgrading their service. We'll send a technician out to make sure your equipment is set up properly and to test the connection. We're actually pretty wide open this week. (pause) (typing sounds) I can get someone out there as early as... looks like Thursday between 10 AM and 2 PM, or we've got availability Friday afternoon as well. What works better for you?

Customer: Thursday is actually perfect. I'll be home anyway.

Agent: Excellent. (pause) So let me just review what we're gonna set up for you. You'll be upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, which is 300 megabits per second download. Your promotional rate for the first twelve months will be $99.99 per month, and then it'll be $119.99 after that. Installation is free, and we'll have a technician there Thursday between 10 AM and 2 PM. 

Customer: That sounds good. And I'll keep the same modem and router, right? Or...?

Agent: Actually, that's a good question. Your current equipment should technically support the higher speeds, but honestly, I'd recommend we bring out our newer modem just to make sure you're getting the full benefit of that 300 meg connection. It's a newer model, and it's gonna give you more stable performance. There's no charge for the equipment swap—it's included.

Customer: Okay, great. Yeah, that sounds good. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Nope, not really. Just make sure someone's gonna be home during that window on Thursday. The technician will call or text 15 minutes before they arrive. Installation usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes. And I'd recommend having your current modem and router location accessible so our tech can make the swap.

Customer: Perfect. And just to confirm... I won't have any service interruption or anything?

Agent: We'll have minimal downtime—probably just a few minutes while we swap out the modem. But your internet should be back up and running pretty much right away. If you have any issues, we've got 24/7 customer support.

Customer: Awesome. I really appreciate this, Marcus. This should make things way better at home.

Agent: Happy to help, David. And thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. You've been super helpful.

Agent: Great. Well, you're all set. I'll send you a confirmation email with all these details and your service window for Thursday. If you have any questions before then, just give us a call back. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you Thursday.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus. Have a good one.

Agent: You too, David. Take care.
