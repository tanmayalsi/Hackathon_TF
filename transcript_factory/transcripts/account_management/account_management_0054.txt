Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently a customer and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet service. I've got the 100 meg plan right now and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've had a lot of customers in your situation, especially with more people working from home these days. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years now on that 100 megabit plan. What's driving the need for the upgrade? Is it streaming, working from home, or...?

Customer: Yeah, a combination of things. My wife and I both work from home now, and we've got two kids who are constantly on their devices. Netflix, YouTube, all that stuff. Lately the connection just keeps dropping, especially in the afternoons, and it's been really frustrating during video calls.

Agent: Yeah, that's definitely a frustration point. The good news is that upgrading could really help with that. We have a couple of options for you. We offer 400 megabit service, and we've also got our gigabit plan which is 1 gig. Which one sounds more interesting to you?

Customer: (pause) What's the difference in price between those two?

Agent: Great question. So your current plan is $79.99 a month. The 400 meg plan would be $109.99, and the gig plan is $149.99. However... (pause) I'm actually seeing a promotion here that I can apply to your account. Since you've been a loyal customer, you'd qualify for a new customer offer on the gig plan, which would bring it down to $89.99 for the first year.

Customer: Wait, really? So the gigabit would be cheaper than the 400 plan?

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, I know, it sounds backwards, but that's the promo we're running right now. After that first year, it would go to the regular $149.99, but honestly, a lot of customers stick with it because they love the speeds and then we usually have other promotions coming up.

Customer: That's... actually pretty good. But let me ask you, is the gigabit overkill? Like, will I actually notice the difference?

Agent: So that's a fair question. For your household with multiple people streaming and working from home? No, it's definitely not overkill. With gig speeds, you're looking at super fast downloads, uploads that won't leave your wife hanging during her video calls, and it handles multiple high-bandwidth activities at the same time without any slowdowns. You'd probably notice the difference almost immediately.

Customer: Okay, so if I go with that, what happens? When would it be installed and... do I need new equipment?

Agent: (typing sounds) Good question. So we would need to schedule a technician visit, which typically takes about an hour. We have availability... let me see here... we could do next Wednesday between 2 and 5 PM, or we have some slots open on Friday morning starting at 8 AM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Wednesday afternoon would be better. I don't have to start work until later that day.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to put you down for Wednesday, the 15th, between 2 and 5 PM. And regarding equipment—you'll need a new modem to handle those speeds. We can either ship that to you ahead of time, or the tech can bring it with them on Wednesday. What's your preference?

Customer: Ship it early so I can have it before they get there? Actually, wait... (pause) will I get a new router too?

Agent: Great thinking. So the modem and router are typically separate. The modem we'll definitely send. For the router, our tech can assess what you have on Wednesday. If it's older, they might recommend an upgrade, but the newer modem should work with most routers. That said, we do offer a mesh WiFi system upgrade for an additional $15 a month that really helps with coverage in larger homes.

Customer: How many rooms are we talking here?

Agent: The mesh system covers up to about 3,000 square feet with two nodes. You get much stronger signal throughout the whole house, especially in bedrooms or home offices that might be far from your router.

Customer: Yeah, actually that might be worth it. My office is upstairs and I've always had weaker signal up there. Let's do it.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm putting that in your order as well. So to recap—you're upgrading from the 100 meg to our 1 gigabit plan at $89.99 for the first year, adding the mesh WiFi system for $15 a month, new modem being shipped out, tech visit Wednesday the 15th between 2 and 5 PM, and we'll assess your router situation then. Does all that sound right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Um... what's the total going to be then?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) So your first month will be $104.99 with everything included. Then after the first year, once the promotion expires on the internet service, it'll be $164.99 monthly if you keep all the services.

Customer: (pause) Okay... and I can cancel the mesh system if I don't like it, right?

Agent: Absolutely. There's no contract on that add-on. You can cancel it anytime. Though I think you'll be pretty happy with it once that tech gets everything set up for you.

Customer: Alright, cool. And when will the modem arrive?

Agent: You should receive it by Friday. The tech visit is Wednesday, but having it by Friday gives you a little buffer. We'll send a tracking number to your email address on file once it ships out. Should be within the next 24 hours or so.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Not on your end, really. Just make sure someone's home Wednesday for the technician. They'll call 30 minutes before they arrive, so you'll get a heads up. Other than that, you're all set!

Customer: Great, thanks Derek. I appreciate your help.

Agent: Hey, no problem at all. I'm glad we could find a solution that works for you. You're going to love those speeds. Oh, and I'm going to send you a confirmation email right now with all these details—your new service address, the tech appointment, everything. Keep that for your records.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being a longtime customer with us. You have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now!
