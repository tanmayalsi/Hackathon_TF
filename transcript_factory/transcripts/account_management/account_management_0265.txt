# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently subscribed to your 100 megabit plan, and I'm finding that it's just not cutting it anymore. I work from home, and my wife streams a lot, so we're constantly buffering and just... it's frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand. Working from home definitely requires a solid connection. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got it. So you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. That's a great service, but I hear you—simultaneous usage can definitely impact your speeds. What kind of activities are you and your wife typically doing online at the same time?

Customer: Well, like, I'm usually on Zoom calls for work, sometimes with video, and she'll be streaming Netflix or just browsing. And then there's the Ring doorbell, smart home stuff... it all adds up, you know?

Agent: Absolutely, yeah. Those devices can consume more bandwidth than people realize. Good news is, we have some excellent upgrade options that would suit your needs perfectly. We offer Fiber 200, which doubles your current speed, or if you want maximum performance, we have Fiber 500 or even our Fiber Gig plan, which is one gigabit per second.

Customer: Wow, okay. What's the difference in price? I mean, I don't need anything crazy—just something that won't make me look bad on client calls. (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) I feel that. Let me check your current pricing. (pause, typing sounds) So right now you're at $79.99 a month for the Fiber 100. If you upgrade to Fiber 200, I can get you set up at $99.99 a month for the first twelve months, and then it goes to $119.99. That's a really solid option for your situation.

Customer: Okay, what about the 500?

Agent: The Fiber 500 plan is $149.99 a month for the first year, then $179.99 after that. Honestly, for what you're describing, I think the 200 would be your sweet spot. It'll give you plenty of headroom without overpaying for something you won't fully utilize.

Customer: And the installation... is there a fee for that?

Agent: Great question. Since you're already a Frontier customer, we can actually waive the installation fee. Normally that's $99, but I can take care of that for you. We'd just need to schedule a technician to come out and upgrade your equipment—that's usually a pretty quick visit, maybe an hour or so.

Customer: When's the soonest you could do that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability in your area. What days work best for you? We have morning slots, afternoon slots...

Customer: Um, this Saturday would be ideal if you have it.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) This Saturday... I'm showing we have availability between 8 AM and noon, or 1 PM to 5 PM. Which window works better for you?

Customer: The afternoon one, 1 to 5.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I'm getting you scheduled for this Saturday, January 18th, between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will bring the new modem and router, get everything set up, and do a speed test to make sure you're getting the full 200 megs. You'll be all set.

Customer: Awesome. And just to confirm, my bill goes up to $99.99 starting next month?

Agent: Correct. Your current cycle ends on the 24th, so your first Fiber 200 bill will be for the new rate starting on January 25th. You'll see the $99.99 charge, and then after twelve months, it'll adjust to the regular price.

Customer: Alright, that sounds good. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: Just have a valid ID ready for the technician on Saturday, and make sure you're home during that window. Oh, and if you need to reschedule, you can do that through your online account or just give us a call. The technician will also have your new router settings, or you can check your email after activation—we'll send all that information.

Customer: Got it. I think that's everything.

Agent: Wonderful. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for the help, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you for choosing Frontier, and I hope the faster speeds make a big difference for you and your wife. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
