Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm pretty happy with the service, but I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan is... I think it's the 100 meg plan?

Agent: Great! I'm glad to hear you've been happy with us. Let me just pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect. Okay, I'm seeing here that you're on our Fiber 100 plan at $64.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. Um, so here's the thing—I've been working from home a lot more now, and I've got my wife and two kids all streaming and doing schoolwork at the same time, and honestly, the speeds just aren't cutting it anymore. Like, I'll be on a Zoom call and suddenly everything just... buffers.

Agent: I totally understand. That can be really frustrating, especially when you're juggling work calls. The good news is we've got some excellent options for you. So with four people using the internet simultaneously, I'd recommend looking at either our Fiber 300 or Fiber 500 plan. The 300 would definitely give you more breathing room, but the 500 is really ideal for heavy households like yours.

Customer: What's the price difference? I don't want to go crazy, but I also need something that actually works, you know?

Agent: (typing) Absolutely. So your current plan is $64.99. Our Fiber 300 is $89.99 per month, and the Fiber 500 is $119.99. Now, I should mention we have a promotion running right now where we can knock $20 off your first three months if you upgrade today.

Customer: Oh really? So that'd be like... what, $70 for the first three months on the 300?

Agent: Exactly. You'd be at $69.99 for the first three months, then it goes to the regular $89.99. And that's a locked-in rate—it won't go up for the first year.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. What about installation? Is there any charge for that, or...?

Agent: Great question. Since you're an existing customer and we already have the fiber to your location, the installation would be completely free. We'd just need to send a technician out to upgrade your ONT—that's your fiber terminal—and swap out your modem. It usually takes about an hour, and you'd be good to go.

Customer: Okay, okay. And how soon could someone come out?

Agent: (typing) Let me check our availability. We're actually pretty open this week. I'm showing we have availability tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 4 PM, or we have several slots on Thursday if that's better for you.

Customer: Tomorrow would be perfect, actually. I'm working from home anyway.

Agent: Excellent. So just to confirm, you'd like to upgrade to the Fiber 300 plan with the promotional pricing, and schedule installation for tomorrow between 2 and 4 PM?

Customer: Yeah, let's do it. Oh, but one more thing—will my email address stay the same? I don't want to have to notify everybody...

Agent: That's a good question. (pause) Your email address—do you have a Frontier email address, or are you using something like Gmail for most things?

Customer: I think I have one, but honestly, I don't really use it. Most of my email is Gmail.

Agent: Perfect, then you won't have any issues. Your account login information will stay the same, and if you do use the Frontier email, that continues as well. It's all tied to your account.

Customer: Okay, great. I think I'm good then.

Agent: Wonderful. Let me just go ahead and process this upgrade for you. (typing sounds) I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I confirm the installation appointment in our system. Should only be about 30 seconds.

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, then stops) Thank you for your patience. Alright, you're all set. Your installation is confirmed for tomorrow between 2 and 4 PM. You'll receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes, and we'll also send you a text reminder tomorrow morning.

Customer: Perfect.

Agent: Is there a best number to reach you if the technician needs to contact you for any reason?

Customer: The phone number you already have should be fine—the 555-0147.

Agent: Great, I've got that noted. So your new Fiber 300 plan will go into effect tomorrow, and your first bill reflecting the promotional pricing will be sent out at the end of the month. You should see a significant improvement in your speeds and your ability to handle multiple devices.

Customer: Awesome. I really appreciate it, Marcus. This should definitely help with everything.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you for choosing Frontier, and thank you for being such a loyal customer. If you have any questions before tomorrow or after installation, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Thanks so much. Have a good one.

Agent: You too! Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
