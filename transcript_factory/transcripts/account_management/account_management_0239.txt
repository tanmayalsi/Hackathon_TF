Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've been hearing that a lot lately, especially with more people working from home. Let me help you find something that works better for you. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And what's your name, please?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Great, David. I've got your account here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Look, I got a new job last month where I'm working from home three days a week, and honestly, the speeds just aren't keeping up. My wife's been complaining about video calls dropping during her Zoom meetings, and then when I'm trying to upload files for work, it takes forever.

Agent: That sounds frustrating, especially when you're both relying on the connection. What kind of speeds are you typically looking for? Are you doing video uploads, large file transfers, that sort of thing?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I mean, I don't need anything crazy, but something faster than 100 would be great. What's the next step up?

Agent: (pause) Well, we have a few options for you. Our Fiber 200 plan would double your speeds to 200 megabits per second. That's usually great for multiple people streaming or working from home simultaneously. Then we've got our Fiber 500, which is our most popular upgrade, and we also have Fiber Gig for our highest performance needs.

Customer: What's the price difference? I'm on... I think it's around 60 bucks a month right now?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, you're at $59.99 monthly. Now, I'm actually looking at our current promotions, and we have something really good going on right now. The Fiber 200 would be $79.99 per month for the first twelve months, then it goes to $89.99. But if you're interested in the Fiber 500, we can get you that for $99.99 for your first year.

Customer: Hmm. That Fiber 500... how much faster is that compared to the 200?

Agent: The Fiber 500 gives you 500 megabits per second download speeds, so you're getting two and a half times the speed of the Fiber 200. For your situation with both you and your wife working from home and uploading files, I'd actually recommend that one. It really future-proofs your setup, and honestly, the price difference isn't huge, especially with the promotional rate.

Customer: That does sound pretty good. What about installation? Will I need to have someone come out, or...?

Agent: (pause) That's a great question. Since you already have Fiber to your home, we can actually do a self-installation kit. We'd mail that out to you, and you'd just swap out the modem and gateway yourself. Takes about ten minutes, and there's video instructions included. However, if you'd prefer a technician to come out and set it up, we can absolutely schedule that as well. There would be a $79.95 installation fee for the technician visit.

Customer: Oh, really? No charge for the self-install?

Agent: That's right. Completely free. Most of our customers find it pretty straightforward, but we're always here if you run into any issues. You can call us back anytime.

Customer: That's convenient. Yeah, I think I'll do the self-install then. When can we get this going?

Agent: (typing sounds) Awesome. So I'm going to process this upgrade for you right now. The good news is, with the self-install kit, we can get that out to you within two to three business days, and you can activate it right away once it arrives. Your service will start at the new speed as soon as you complete the setup.

Customer: That's fast. Okay, so just to confirm, I'm going from the 100 to the 500?

Agent: Yes, exactly. From Fiber 100 to Fiber 500. Your new rate is $99.99 per month for the first twelve months, then $119.99 after that. The installation kit will arrive in two to three business days with full instructions. And your current bill of $59.99 will be prorated for the remainder of this billing cycle.

Customer: Perfect. That sounds good to me.

Agent: (typing sounds) Excellent. I'm getting that all set up here... and... there we go. Your upgrade has been confirmed. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour with your tracking information for the installation kit and the activation instructions.

Customer: Great. Um, one more thing—will I notice a big difference in my speeds right now?

Agent: (pause) That's a good question. You'll definitely notice an improvement once the new equipment is installed and activated. Your speeds will jump from 100 to 500 Mbps, so yeah, you should see a significant difference in how fast things load and how smoothly your video calls go. You might actually want to restart your computer and modem once everything's installed, just to clear everything out.

Customer: Will do. Hey, I appreciate your help, Marcus. This was easy.

Agent: My pleasure, David. Thanks for choosing Frontier. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks so much for calling, and welcome to Fiber 500. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
