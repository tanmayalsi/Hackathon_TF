# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently a customer with you guys and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. I can definitely look into upgrade options for you. Let me just pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I also get the best name on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's Michael Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Michael, I'm showing here that you're currently on our Fiber 200 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've had it for like... three years now? And honestly, it was fine back then, but I'm working from home more these days and my wife streams a lot, and we've got a Ring doorbell, Alexa stuff, you know... it's just getting slow. Pages are loading slower, and sometimes the connection just drops.

Agent: I completely understand. With more devices on the network, 200 Mbps can definitely start to feel limiting, especially if you're doing video conferencing and streaming simultaneously. The good news is we have some excellent upgrade options available in your area. Let me tell you what we've got. (pause) We offer Fiber 500, which doubles your speed to 500 Mbps, and we also have Fiber Gig, which is our gigabit service at 1,000 Mbps.

Customer: Wow, okay. What's the difference in price? Because I'm also on a pretty tight budget right now.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check your current rate real quick. I'm seeing you're at $59.99 a month for the Fiber 200. If you were to upgrade to Fiber 500, that would be $79.99 per month. And the Fiber Gig is $99.99 per month.

Customer: Hmm, so it's like twenty bucks more for the 500?

Agent: That's correct, yes. And here's the thing—I'm actually seeing that we have a promotion running right now. If you upgrade today, I can lock you into the Fiber 500 for $69.99 for the first twelve months. After that, it goes to the regular $79.99. So you'd save ten dollars a month for the first year.

Customer: Oh, really? That's... that's not bad actually. And what about the gig service? Do you have a deal on that too?

Agent: (pause) Let me see here... (typing sounds) Unfortunately, the gigabit promotion is only available for new customers at the moment, but... (pause) what I can do is give you the intro rate of $89.99 for the first year instead of the regular $99.99. So you'd save ten dollars a month on that one as well.

Customer: Okay, so I'd be looking at either $69.99 for the 500 or $89.99 for the gig for a year. After that, it goes up?

Agent: Correct. After the promotional year, Fiber 500 would be $79.99, and Fiber Gig would be $99.99. But honestly, Michael, if you're looking at long-term value and you want to future-proof yourself... I mean, with the gig service, you're getting five times the speed of what you have now. Future-proofing is something a lot of our customers are thinking about these days.

Customer: Yeah, I hear you. Can I ask—is there any installation fee or anything like that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great question. Since you're an existing customer upgrading your service, there's no installation fee. The technician would come out and just swap out your modem to one that's compatible with the higher speeds. It's basically a quick visit, usually takes about thirty minutes to an hour.

Customer: That's nice. And when could they come out?

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Let me check availability. (pause) I'm showing we have availability... looks like we could get someone out to you as early as tomorrow morning, or if that doesn't work, we have several slots available throughout the week. What works best for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? That's fast. Um, let me think... actually, tomorrow morning would be perfect. I've got the day off.

Agent: Perfect! (typing sounds) So I have you scheduled for tomorrow between 8 AM and 10 AM. Does that window work?

Customer: Yeah, that's great.

Agent: Excellent. And just to confirm, Michael, you'd like to go with the Fiber Gig service at $89.99 per month for the first twelve months?

Customer: Yeah, let's do it. I figure if we're upgrading, might as well go all in, right?

Agent: (chuckles) That's the spirit. I think you're going to be really happy with the upgrade. You're going to see a huge difference, especially with everything you've got going on. (typing sounds) Alright, so just to recap: We're upgrading you from Fiber 200 to Fiber Gig, starting tomorrow morning. Your promotional rate is locked in at $89.99 per month for the first twelve months, and the technician will be there between 8 AM and 10 AM. You'll receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all these details.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure you have access to your modem—it's probably in your living room or office somewhere, right? The technician will take care of everything else. Oh, and if you have any questions before they arrive, you can call us back and we'll be happy to help.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. That's really helpful, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: Absolutely, my pleasure, Michael. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too, take care.

Agent: Bye now.
