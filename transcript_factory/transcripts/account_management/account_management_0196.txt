Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've got the basic plan right now and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've definitely seen a lot of customers making that switch, especially with everyone working from home these days. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing here you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I got it about two years ago, and back then it was fine, but now I'm working from home three days a week, my wife streams a lot, and our kids are doing online school stuff... it's just bogging down, especially in the evenings.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. Multiple devices really do add up. So with your current plan you're getting about 100 megabits per second download speeds. We've got a couple of great options I can tell you about. We have our Frontier Fiber 300 plan, which gives you 300 meg down, and then we've also got our Frontier Fiber Gig plan, which is our gigabit service. That's 940 megs down.

Customer: Wow, okay. What's the price difference? I mean, I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (pause) Alright, so let me check your address for promotional availability. (typing sounds) What's your street address?

Customer: It's 4782 Meadowbrook Lane.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. So good news—you're definitely eligible for upgrades. For the Fiber 300 plan, we can get you set up at $64.99 a month for the first year, then it goes to our regular rate of $79.99. And for the Fiber Gig plan, it's $79.99 for the first year, then $99.99 after that.

Customer: Hmm, so that's like... fifteen bucks more for the gig plan in the first year?

Agent: That's correct, yes. But honestly, for the gig plan you're getting over three times the speeds. With multiple people on your network doing different things—streaming, video conferencing, downloads—the gig plan is really the sweet spot if you want to avoid any slowdowns.

Customer: (pause) Do I need new equipment or anything?

Agent: Great question. Your current modem and router will need to be upgraded to support those faster speeds. We can ship you new equipment at no charge, and it's really easy to set up. It usually takes about five to ten minutes. Or if you'd prefer, we can schedule a technician to come out and do it for you. That's a one-time service fee of $99.

Customer: Can't I just do it myself? I'm not... I'm not totally tech-savvy, but I can probably figure it out.

Agent: Absolutely, most customers do it themselves and it's painless. We'll include instructions, and honestly, it's pretty straightforward. You just unbox it, plug in the power and the fiber line, and you're good to go. We'll also email you setup instructions and you can always call us if you run into any questions.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. I think I'll go with the gig plan then.

Agent: Excellent choice. (typing sounds) So just to confirm—you want to upgrade from Frontier Fiber 100 to Frontier Fiber Gig, $79.99 for the first year. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, sounds good.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, we're also going to waive the installation fee for you, which normally would be $199.99, so that's a nice savings there.

Customer: Oh nice! That helps.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great. So I'm going to need to confirm a few details for the upgrade. Is your service address still 4782 Meadowbrook Lane?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: And your phone number?

Customer: 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, your upgrade is all set. Your new equipment will ship out today or tomorrow, and you should receive it within three to five business days. Once you get it, just give us a call if you have any questions. Your new plan becomes active as soon as we receive confirmation that your equipment is installed.

Customer: Okay, great. Um, one more thing—is there anything else I should know? Like, does the speed have anything to do with my WiFi router as well?

Agent: Oh, that's a smart question. So the equipment we're sending you includes a modem and a WiFi 6 router, which is really the latest technology. That'll definitely give you the best WiFi performance throughout your home. If you have a really large house or thick walls, sometimes people grab an additional WiFi extender, but honestly, most people are really happy with just the router we provide.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. And this is locked in at that price for a year?

Agent: Yes, $79.99 per month for twelve months, and then it'll adjust to the regular rate after that. We'll definitely send you a notification before any rate change happens.

Customer: Alright, I think that's everything. Thank you for walking me through this, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! I really appreciate your business. Just to recap one more time—your new equipment should arrive within three to five business days. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're all set. Have a great day, and thanks again for choosing Frontier!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
