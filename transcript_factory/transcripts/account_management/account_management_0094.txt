Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Marcus. So I'm currently a customer with you guys, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just... I think it's like 100 megs or something? And it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: Okay, great! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. To get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing your account now. So you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right. I'm not totally sure of the exact name, but it's the 100 meg service.

Agent: No problem. So what's been going on that's making you feel like you need more speed? Are you streaming a lot, working from home, or...?

Customer: All of the above, honestly. I'm working from home a lot more now, and my partner also works from home. Plus we've got two kids who are always streaming videos or doing remote schooling stuff. It just feels like everything's slow, and then when someone tries to video conference, it gets even worse.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. So with multiple devices and that kind of usage, you're probably hitting the bandwidth limits pretty regularly. We have a couple of great options for you. Our most popular upgrade would be our Fiber 500 plan, which gives you 500 megabits per second. That's a pretty significant jump from your current 100 megs.

Customer: Okay, and... I mean, what's the price difference gonna be?

Agent: (pause) Let me see here. So you're currently paying... $64.99 a month for the Fiber 100, correct?

Customer: Hmm, I think so. Yeah, sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, so upgrading to our Fiber 500 would bring you to $79.99 per month. That's a fifteen dollar increase. And with that plan, you'd get the higher speeds, plus we'd also upgrade your equipment at no additional charge—you'd get our newer router, which has better range and handles multiple devices a lot more efficiently.

Customer: That's... that's not too bad, actually. What about the highest one? You guys have like a gig plan, right?

Agent: We do, yes! So we offer Fiber 1 Gig, which is our top tier plan. That gives you up to 1 gigabit per second download speeds. That's a thousand megs.

Customer: Wow, okay. How much is that?

Agent: That plan runs $109.99 per month, so it'd be about forty-five dollars more than what you're paying now. And honestly, for a household like yours with multiple people working from home and streaming... a lot of my customers in similar situations really love it. There's essentially no lag, no buffering issues...

Customer: (laughs) That sounds amazing, but... I don't know, that seems like maybe more than we need? Like, would the 500 be enough for what I described?

Agent: The 500 would absolutely handle what you're doing. The 1 Gig is really more if you're doing like heavy 4K streaming, online gaming, large file uploads—that kind of thing. For your situation, the Fiber 500 would be solid.

Customer: Okay, yeah, let's go with the 500 then. How soon can that be set up?

Agent: Great choice! So we can actually get that activated for you pretty quickly. Are you home during the day?

Customer: Um... yeah, most days. What do you mean?

Agent: Well, since you're upgrading to a new plan tier, we'll need to send a technician out to upgrade your equipment and make sure everything's optimized on your line. It's usually pretty quick—usually less than an hour. Do you have any preference on days this week?

Customer: Oh, okay. Uh, let me think... Tomorrow's not great because I've got back-to-back meetings. How about Thursday? Afternoon would be better.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... Okay, I'm showing we have a window on Thursday between 1 PM and 5 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works. That should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to get you scheduled for a technician visit on Thursday, 1 to 5 PM. And I'll send you an email and text confirmation of that appointment. Before you go, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: Um, no, I think that's it. How long does it take before the speed increase shows up, like after the tech comes out?

Agent: Once the technician completes the upgrade, you should be on the new speeds immediately. You might want to restart your devices just to make sure everything's running smoothly, but you should notice the difference right away. A lot of customers do a quick speed test to see it for themselves.

Customer: Cool, cool. All right, well, thanks Marcus. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You should see that confirmation come through shortly. If you have any issues with the installation on Thursday, just give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
