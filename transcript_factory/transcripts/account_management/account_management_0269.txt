Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Great, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, or the email address you use with us?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, I'm seeing an account here under... Sarah Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Excellent. So, Sarah, I'm showing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. A hundred megabits, right? It was great when I first got it, but now I'm working from home a lot more, and honestly, my husband streams constantly, and our kid does online school. It's just not fast enough anymore. We're getting a lot of lag.

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually something we hear pretty often, especially with multiple users. The good news is you're already in a fiber-served area, so we have some really solid options for you. Let me tell you what we have available. (pause) We offer Fiber 300, which gives you 300 megabits per second, Fiber 500 at 500 megs, or our Fiber Gig, which is one gigabit per second.

Customer: Wow, okay. So those are quite a bit faster. Um, what's the price difference? I'm currently paying... I think it's around 79 a month?

Agent: (typing) So you're on a promotional rate right now at $79. That pricing was locked in for a year, and let me just check... (pause) looks like you're coming up on the end of that in about two months. So the standard rate for your current plan would be $99 per month after that.

Customer: Oh, okay, so it's going up anyway?

Agent: Yes, unfortunately the promotional period is ending, so you'd see an increase. But here's what's great—if you upgrade to Fiber 300, I can lock you in at $89 per month for the first year. That's actually better than your renewal rate on the Fiber 100.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad. And that's 300 megabits?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Three times faster than what you have now. For most households with multiple people working or streaming, that's a really solid sweet spot. The Fiber 500 would be $109 for the first year, and the Gig would be $129.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so jumping to 300 would actually save me money compared to just renewing?

Agent: That's right. For the first year, you'd pay $89 instead of $99. After that first year, pricing could adjust, but I can definitely note in your account that you're a loyal customer, and that helps when we're looking at renewal options.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I think 300 sounds like it would be enough. I don't think we need a full gig or anything. Can I ask... is there any installation fee or anything like that?

Agent: Great question. Since you already have our fiber service installed, this would just be a line speed upgrade on your modem. There's no installation fee for that. We'd just need to push through a configuration update, which typically takes about five to ten minutes. You might experience a brief service interruption, maybe thirty seconds or so, but that's pretty much it.

Customer: Oh, that's easy then. When could you do that?

Agent: (typing) Well, we can actually get that scheduled for you right now. Let me see what appointments we have available... (pause) I'm showing we have availability tomorrow between 10 AM and noon, or we could do Thursday afternoon between 2 PM and 4 PM. Or if you'd prefer, we could do it early evening tonight around 8 PM. We can do it remotely, so nobody needs to come to your house.

Customer: Oh really? We don't need a technician to come out?

Agent: Not for this upgrade, no. Since the infrastructure is already there, we just update your modem settings from our end. You won't need to do anything on your end, though I do always recommend powering off any devices during the upgrade, just to be safe.

Customer: Got it. Um, let me check with my husband. (brief pause) He said Thursday afternoon is better for us. Two to four PM?

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, so I have you down for Thursday, March 14th, between 2 and 4 PM. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next hour. Is the contact number we have, 555-0147, still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yes, that's perfect.

Agent: And we have your email as... sarah.chen1987@email.com, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. So just to recap everything: you're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300. Your new rate will be $89 per month for the first year, locked in. The upgrade is scheduled for Thursday, March 14th, between 2 and 4 PM. There's no installation fee, and you might see a brief service interruption during the upgrade. You'll get a confirmation shortly, and if anything changes, just call us back at the number on your bill.

Customer: Okay, that all sounds great. Thank you so much, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. I really appreciate your business with Frontier, and I think you're going to notice a huge difference with that extra speed. If you have any issues after the upgrade or any questions before Thursday, don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: I will, thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye!
