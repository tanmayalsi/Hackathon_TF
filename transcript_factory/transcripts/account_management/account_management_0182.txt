# Frontier Communications - Upgrade Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And just to confirm, is this for the service address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. I'm looking at your account now. So you're currently on our Gig Lite plan, is that right? 500 megabits per second?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, I work from home pretty often now, and my roommate is always streaming stuff, so we're constantly running into speed issues. Pages take forever to load sometimes, and video calls get choppy.

Agent: Oh man, I totally get that. Multiple users and work-from-home setups really do require more bandwidth than people expect. (pause) So good news—we have some excellent options available at your address. You could move up to our standard Gig plan, which is one gigabit per second, or if you want to future-proof yourself, we also have Gig Pro at two gigabits per second.

Customer: Wow, two gigabits? (pause) That seems like overkill, but... what's the price difference?

Agent: So your Gig Lite is currently $79.99 a month, right?

Customer: Yeah.

Agent: Okay, so the standard Gig plan would be $99.99 per month, and the Gig Pro at two gigs would be $139.99. Now, here's the thing—we're currently running a promotion where I can lock you in at $89.99 for the standard Gig plan for your first year.

Customer: Oh, so it goes up after a year?

Agent: It would go to $99.99 after the promotional period, yes. But honestly, at double the speed for just ten dollars more the first year, that's a pretty solid deal. And you wouldn't have any setup fees or anything like that.

Customer: (pause) That actually sounds reasonable. So I'd be getting twice the speed for like... what, ten bucks extra the first year?

Agent: Exactly. And the nice thing is, with the one gig plan, you'll have plenty of headroom for multiple devices, video conferencing, streaming—all happening at the same time without any slowdown.

Customer: Yeah, I think that makes sense. Let me go with that. But... um... [inaudible] sorry, I have to ask—how quickly can you upgrade me? Do I need to replace my router or anything?

Agent: Great question. So the upgrade can happen as soon as tomorrow if you'd like. Your current modem and router should actually be compatible with the gigabit speeds, but we do have newer equipment available if you want to swap it out. A lot of customers find that newer equipment optimizes the connection better, but it's totally optional.

Customer: I think I'll stick with what I have for now. If it's not working well, I can always call back, right?

Agent: Absolutely. No problem at all. (typing sounds) Okay, so let me just get a few details here and get this upgrade scheduled for you. Is tomorrow afternoon good for you?

Customer: Tomorrow? Really? Like, how long would it take?

Agent: The upgrade itself is pretty seamless—you shouldn't experience any downtime at all, actually. We push it through on our end. You might want to restart your modem once we push the upgrade, just to make sure everything syncs up properly.

Customer: Oh wow, that's way easier than I thought. Yeah, tomorrow afternoon is perfect. I'm around all day.

Agent: Wonderful. (pause) Okay, I've got that scheduled. Your new rate of $89.99 per month will be effective on your next billing cycle, which looks like... the 15th of next month. And I'm going to send you an email confirmation with all the details—your new plan, the pricing, the upgrade date—all of that.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope, you're all set! Just watch for that confirmation email, and again, you might want to restart your modem tomorrow just to be safe. If you have any issues at all after the upgrade, you can always call us back. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks so much, Derek. This was really helpful.

Agent: My pleasure! Thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now! (line disconnects)
