Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with your service, but I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Oh, that's great to hear you've been a satisfied customer! I'd be happy to help you with an upgrade. Let me just pull up your account here real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got it. And just to confirm, is this Monica Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Wonderful. So I'm seeing here that you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that the one you've been using?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. A hundred megs, right? It was great when I first got it, but honestly, with working from home now and my husband streaming, we're constantly bumping into the speed limit. I've been getting those notifications that I'm using too much bandwidth, and...

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. That's actually pretty common with remote work. (pause) So what kind of activities are you typically doing that are pushing the limits?

Customer: Well, I'm on video calls pretty much all day for my job, so that's taking up a lot of bandwidth. And then my husband's got Netflix or YouTube running, and our kids are trying to do online schoolwork in the afternoons. It's just... yeah, it adds up.

Agent: Yeah, that makes complete sense. So with multiple users and streaming, you'd definitely benefit from a faster plan. What speeds were you thinking about upgrading to?

Customer: Um, I'm not entirely sure. What would you recommend for our situation?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Great question. So our next tier up would be our Fiber 300 plan, which gives you 300 megabits per second. That would be plenty for work-from-home video conferencing, streaming, and online schooling all happening at the same time without any issues. Beyond that, we also have Fiber 500 and Fiber 1 Gig if you wanted to really future-proof yourself.

Customer: Okay, so 300 seems like... that would be good? Is there a big difference in price?

Agent: Let me check your current rate real quick. (typing sounds) So you're at $64.99 a month for Fiber 100. If you upgrade to Fiber 300, that would be $84.99 per month for the first 12 months, and then it would go to the regular rate of $99.99 after that. We do have a promotion running right now, actually.

Customer: Okay, and what about the 500?

Agent: The Fiber 500 is $109.99 for the first year, then $129.99 after. Honestly, for most households, the 300 is gonna be more than sufficient, but the 500 is a good middle ground if you want extra headroom.

Customer: (pause) I think 300 would be good for us. What about installation? Do I need to have someone come out?

Agent: Good choice. So the nice thing is, since you already have our Fiber service, we don't need to do an installation. You won't even need a technician visit. We can actually send you a new modem and router, and you'll just need to swap out your old equipment. It's pretty straightforward. We'll ship it out and it should arrive within three to five business days.

Customer: Oh, that's convenient. And I can do it myself?

Agent: Absolutely. We'll include instructions in the box, and honestly, it's just a few cables. But if you have any trouble, you can always call us back and we can walk you through it. Most customers get it set up in less than ten minutes, though.

Customer: Nice. So when would the upgrade take effect?

Agent: (typing sounds) So if you want to proceed today, I can get this activated for you right now. Your new plan would start on your next billing cycle, which looks like... (pause) January 15th. So you'd still be charged at your current rate through January 14th, and then starting the 15th, you'd see the new rate on your bill. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works. Um, one more question—is there a contract or anything? Like, if I decide I don't like it...

Agent: No contract at all. You can make changes to your service anytime, or cancel without any penalties. We're pretty flexible. The only thing is that promotional rate is locked in for 12 months, so after that year is up, the price will adjust to the standard rate unless a new promotion comes through.

Customer: Okay, cool. Yeah, let's do it. Go ahead and upgrade me.

Agent: Perfect! Let me get that processed for you. (typing sounds) Just so I have everything correct—upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, starting your next billing cycle on January 15th. We'll send out the new modem and router, and your old equipment can be returned using the prepaid shipping label we'll include. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect.

Agent: Awesome. (pause, more typing) Great! Your upgrade is all confirmed. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details, your tracking number for the new equipment, and instructions for returning your current modem. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. This was super easy, so thanks a lot.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks so much for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. If you need anything at all once you get the new equipment, just give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too!

Agent: Take care now. (call ends)
