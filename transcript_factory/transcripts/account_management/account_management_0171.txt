Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, I'm currently on the 500 megabit plan, and honestly, I'm thinking about upgrading. My internet's been pretty good, but I'm working from home now and I need something faster.

Agent: Oh, that's great! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Let me just pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing here that you've been with us for about three years, and you're currently on our Fiber 500 plan at $64.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. Actually, I think I might be paying a promotional rate or something? I'm not totally sure.

Agent: Let me check that for you. (typing sounds) Yes, you are on a promotional rate that's set to expire in about four months. So that's good timing to think about upgrading. What kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you thinking 1 gig, or...?

Customer: I mean, 1 gig would be amazing, but I don't want to break the bank. What's the difference in price between what I have and the 1 gig?

Agent: Sure, absolutely. So our Fiber 1 gig plan is currently $89.99 per month. But here's the thing—we actually have a promotion running right now for new upgrades. If you upgrade in the next seven days, we can get you set up at $79.99 for the first twelve months.

Customer: Oh, okay. So that's... (pause) ...that's fifteen dollars more than I'm paying now, even with the discount?

Agent: Right, so it would be about fifteen dollars more than your current promotional rate. But keep in mind, your current promo expires in four months anyway, so the regular price would go up to $79.99 anyway. Plus, with the 1 gig, you'd be getting twice the speed for really just a minimal increase.

Customer: Huh, yeah, that actually makes sense when you put it that way. What about installation? Do I need a technician to come out?

Agent: Great question. So, with an upgrade like this, we would send a technician to your home to make sure everything is properly configured and optimized for the 1 gig speeds. It's usually pretty quick—normally takes about an hour or so. And there's no installation fee for upgrades. (typing sounds) When would be a good time for you?

Customer: Really? No installation fee? That's... that's actually pretty good. Um, let me think. I'm working from home tomorrow, so that's out. How about... Thursday afternoon?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. (pause) Thursday we have a couple of windows open. We could do between 1 and 5 PM, or we have an earlier slot between 8 AM and noon. Which would work better for you?

Customer: The afternoon is better. One to five is fine.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I'm going to go ahead and schedule that for you. Just to confirm—this is at the same address we have on file, correct?

Customer: Yes, 447 Maple Street.

Agent: (typing sounds) Excellent. And just so you know, you'll get a text and an email confirmation with all the details, and the technician might reach out the day before to confirm. Are we good to go with upgrading you to Fiber 1 gig, starting at $79.99 monthly, with installation scheduled for Thursday, 1 to 5 PM?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Oh, one thing though—do I need to do anything with my router or... I have the Frontier one, right?

Agent: Right, so the technician will actually bring a new gateway that's optimized for the 1 gig speeds. They'll set that up for you and make sure everything's working properly. You won't need to do anything—they'll handle it all.

Customer: Oh, awesome. That's super helpful, thank you.

Agent: You're very welcome! And just one more thing—is there anything else I can help you with today? Any questions about the service or anything else?

Customer: No, I think that's it. You've been really helpful, Marcus.

Agent: (brief chuckle) Well, I appreciate that! Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and we're excited to have you on the 1 gig service. You're going to love the speeds. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: Nope, that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Perfect. Have a great day, and I'll see those confirmation details headed your way in just a few minutes. Take care!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
