# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thanks for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've had your internet service for about two years now, and I'm thinking it might be time to upgrade. My current speed just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our 100 Mbps plan in the Asheville area. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. We've been streaming a lot more video lately, you know, and my kids are doing remote homework assignments. When we're all online at the same time, everything just crawls.

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally get that. Hundred meg is good for light use, but with multiple devices and streaming, you're definitely gonna feel that bottleneck. We've got some really solid options for you. What kind of speeds were you looking at? Are we thinking something higher, or are you interested in our top tier?

Customer: Well, what do you have available at my address?

Agent: (pause) Let me check our service availability for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so at your location, we can offer you up to 500 Mbps, or we also have our Gig service—that's 1 Gigabit per second—which is our premium offering. Have you heard of that?

Customer: Wow, 1 Gig? That seems like overkill, but... I mean, what's the price difference?

Agent: So your current plan is $59.99 a month, right? The 500 Meg would be $79.99, and the Gig is $99.99 per month. Now, I should mention we have a promotion running right now. If you upgrade to either of those plans today, I can lock you in at those promotional rates for the first year, and then it goes to regular pricing after that.

Customer: (pause) What's the regular pricing after the year is up?

Agent: After year one, the 500 Meg plan would be $109.99, and the Gig would be $129.99.

Customer: Okay, okay. And there's no installation fee or anything like that?

Agent: Great question. Since you're already an existing customer and we already have the infrastructure at your location, there's no installation fee for the upgrade. We'd just send you a new modem and router—complimentary—and you should see the speed increase right away.

Customer: How long does shipping take?

Agent: (typing sounds) We can get that out to you within two to three business days. You should have it by... let's see, today's Thursday, so you'd have it by Monday or Tuesday at the latest.

Customer: Nice. Okay, so I'm thinking the 500 Meg plan. That should be plenty for what we need.

Agent: Excellent choice. That's gonna be a huge difference from what you're experiencing now. I think you're really gonna notice the improvement, especially with the streaming and the homework uploads. (pause) Before we get this set up, just to confirm—is there anything else I should know? Any service issues or outages you've experienced recently?

Customer: No, no, the service itself has been solid. It's just the speed limitations that are the problem.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, so I'm gonna go ahead and process this upgrade for you. (typing sounds) Your new plan will be 500 Mbps at $79.99 per month for the first twelve months, then $109.99 after that. Your account will be updated immediately, and we'll process the equipment shipment today. Can I confirm the mailing address on file? Is it still 847 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great. And just to set expectations, your new modem should arrive by Tuesday. Once you get it, the setup is pretty straightforward—you'll just unplug your old modem, plug in the new one, and you should be good to go in about five to ten minutes. But if you run into any issues, you can always call us back.

Customer: Sounds good. Will I get a confirmation email or something?

Agent: You absolutely will. You should receive an email within the next hour or so with your upgrade confirmation and tracking information for your new equipment. And hey, just so you know, if you ever want to upgrade to the Gig service down the road, just give us a call. We'd be happy to help.

Customer: I appreciate that. Thanks for walking me through all this, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it.

Agent: Awesome. Well, thanks for being a valued Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You should start seeing those faster speeds by next week. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
