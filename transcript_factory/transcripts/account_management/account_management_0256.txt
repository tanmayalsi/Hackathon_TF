Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, I've had Frontier for about three years now, and I'm pretty happy with the service, but I'm thinking I might need to upgrade. My internet's been feeling kinda slow lately.

Agent: Great! I'm glad you've been a satisfied customer. I'd be happy to help you explore upgrade options. Can I start by pulling up your account? What's the best phone number associated with your Frontier account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm just looking that up here... Okay, I see you're on our 300 megabit plan. How long have you been on that speed tier?

Customer: Uh, I think since we started? Like three years ago. We went with the mid-range option back then because it seemed like plenty, but now I've got two kids doing schoolwork from home, and my wife streams for her job, so... yeah, we're definitely pushing it.

Agent: Oh, absolutely. That makes total sense. With multiple people streaming and uploading simultaneously, 300 megs can get pretty tight. Good news is we've made some excellent upgrades to our network in your area. (pause) Are you looking to step up to something like our 500 meg plan, or would you be interested in our new gigabit service? That's 1,000 megs.

Customer: Wow, gigabit? Is that... like, is that actually necessary? I mean, what's the price difference looking like?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great question. Let me pull that up for you. So your current plan is $79.99 a month. Our 500 megabit plan would be $99.99, and our gigabit plan is $119.99 per month.

Customer: Okay, and... I mean, what would we actually notice? Like, what's the real difference?

Agent: That's a smart question. Honestly, for most households, 500 megs is really solid—you can handle multiple 4K streams at once, quick uploads for your wife's work, and the kids' schooling stuff won't lag out. The gigabit plan really comes into play if you're doing a lot of large file transfers or if you've got like... I dunno, ten devices all going at peak usage simultaneously. But a lot of our customers with setups like yours find 500 megs is the sweet spot.

Customer: Yeah, that sounds like it might be more than enough, actually.

Agent: Nice. And I should mention, we're running a promotion right now for upgrades—I can lock in that $99.99 rate for the first twelve months, then it goes to the regular rate after that. So you'd save about... (pause) twenty bucks a month for a year.

Customer: Oh, okay, that helps. And there's no equipment fee or anything like that?

Agent: (pause) Actually, good catch. You won't have an installation fee since we're upgrading your existing service, but you will need to get a new modem to support the faster speeds. We can mail that to you for free, or if you'd like to pick one up at one of our stores, we have locations around—where are you located?

Customer: We're in Salem, Oregon.

Agent: Perfect. Yeah, we've got a store there on Lancaster Drive. But honestly, the mail option is usually faster—we can get it to you in about three to five business days. You'd just swap out your old modem for the new one, plug it in, and you're good to go. Takes maybe five minutes.

Customer: (pause) That works. And I'll still have the same login and everything? My wife won't lose her work setup?

Agent: Exactly—your WiFi network name and password will stay exactly the same. You're just replacing the physical equipment behind the scenes. No disruption to your setup whatsoever.

Customer: Sweet. Okay, I think I want to do the 500 meg plan then.

Agent: Awesome! (typing sounds) I'm gonna get that set up for you right now. Just to confirm everything—I'm upgrading your account from the 300 megabit plan to our 500 megabit plan at $99.99 per month for the first twelve months, then $119.99 after that. We'll mail you the new modem free of charge, and it should arrive within five business days. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect. How long does it take to actually process the upgrade? Like, when does the new speed kick in?

Agent: (typing sounds) Once you receive the modem and swap it out, your speeds will activate right away. The whole thing's pretty instant once the hardware is in place. You might want to restart your router after you plug in the new modem, just to make sure everything syncs up properly.

Customer: Okay, great. Is there anything else I need to do, or...?

Agent: Nope, you're all set! I'm gonna email you a confirmation of these changes, and you'll get a tracking number for the modem shipment within the next 24 hours. That'll go to the email address we have on file—is that still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Actually, no, that's changed. It's laura.patterson@gmail.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, updating that now. You'll get the confirmation and tracking info at that new email. And hey, if you have any questions or issues once you get the modem, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you.

Customer: Awesome. I really appreciate it, Derek. This should help out a lot.

Agent: Happy to help! Thanks so much for being a loyal Frontier customer, and enjoy that faster internet. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!
