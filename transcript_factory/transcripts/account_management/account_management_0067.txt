# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about... I think three years now? And I'm just really not happy with my current internet speed anymore. I need something faster.

Agent: I completely understand. We've made some great improvements to our fiber network, and a lot of our customers are upgrading. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street in Boise?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So I'm looking at your account now, and I see you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it's just... it's not cutting it anymore. I work from home, my wife streams a lot, and then there's my kids doing school stuff online. We all need something faster.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. With multiple users and work from home, you're definitely gonna want more bandwidth. (pause) So we have a few options for you. Our Fiber 300 plan is super popular right now—that's three hundred megabits per second. And then we also have our Fiber 500, which is five hundred megs. What kind of usage are you thinking you need?

Customer: What's the difference in price?

Agent: Good question. Your current plan is... let me see here... (typing sounds) forty-nine ninety-nine a month. The Fiber 300 would be sixty-nine ninety-nine, and the Fiber 500 is eighty-nine ninety-nine.

Customer: Hmm. And those are locked in prices, or...?

Agent: Great question. So both of those would be locked in for twelve months at that rate. After the promotional period, they would go to regular pricing, but you'd have that year locked in.

Customer: Right, okay. What would regular pricing be?

Agent: (pause) So the Fiber 300 would be eighty-four ninety-nine after the first year, and the Fiber 500 would be [inaudible]... sorry, one second... would be ninety-nine ninety-nine. But you can always call back and we can look at other promotions or options at that time.

Customer: Okay, okay. I think the 300 plan would probably work for us. That's gonna be a decent upgrade from what we have now, right?

Agent: Absolutely. You're tripling your speed, so yeah, that's gonna be a huge difference. You'll definitely notice it with multiple people on the network. When you're doing video calls for work, the kids are streaming, your wife's doing her thing—you'll have plenty of bandwidth for everyone.

Customer: Perfect. Um, one more thing though. My router is pretty old. Can I upgrade that too?

Agent: Absolutely. We can definitely help with that. Our standard fiber router is included free with the service, but if you want our premium mesh system, that's forty-nine ninety-nine one-time. It's got better range and coverage, which a lot of people really like if you have a bigger home or... I don't know, dead zones.

Customer: How big is the house?

Agent: (pause) Sorry, I'm not sure I follow?

Customer: I mean, how big of a house would you need to need the mesh system? Like, is it just if you have a huge place?

Agent: Oh, good question. So it really depends on the layout and construction. The standard router covers most homes up to about 2,000 square feet pretty well. But if you have a larger home, or if there are walls or distance involved, the mesh system is definitely better. Plus, you get better speeds throughout the house because it distributes the signal better.

Customer: Yeah, our house is around 2,500 square feet, and we have a basement. So I think that mesh system might be worth it.

Agent: Yeah, I'd say in that case, it's definitely worth considering. You'll get consistent speeds wherever you are in the house.

Customer: Alright, let's do it.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm gonna get you set up with the Fiber 300 plan. That's sixty-nine ninety-nine for twelve months, and we'll add the premium mesh router for forty-nine ninety-nine, one-time charge. Your service will remain active during the upgrade, so there's no disruption. However, we will need to schedule a technician visit. Do you have any availability this week?

Customer: Um, this week is pretty packed. What about next week?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me check our tech schedule. We have availability on Tuesday or Thursday of next week. Would either of those work?

Customer: Thursday works better for me. What time?

Agent: We have a morning slot between eight and noon, or an afternoon slot between one and five.

Customer: Morning is better.

Agent: Great, so I'm gonna put you down for Thursday morning between eight and noon. The technician will call you thirty minutes before they arrive, just as a courtesy. The visit should take about an hour or so.

Customer: That sounds good. And they'll set up the new router?

Agent: Yes, they'll install everything, configure it, make sure everything's running smoothly, and they'll get you set up on the WiFi. They can also answer any questions you have about the equipment.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: (pause) Let me think... no, I think we're all set. I'm gonna send a confirmation email to the address on your account. It'll have all the details—the plan change, the appointment time, everything. If you need to reschedule for any reason, there's a link in that email, or you can always call us back.

Customer: Great, that's really helpful.

Agent: You're welcome. And just to confirm everything before we finish up—the address is still the one on Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for upgrading with Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for the help, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. Have a great day, and we'll see you Thursday morning.

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
