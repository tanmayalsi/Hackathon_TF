Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just... I think it's 100 megabits? And honestly, it's been pretty slow lately, especially when my wife is working from home.

Agent: I completely understand. We've been upgrading a lot of customers in your area, and faster speeds can really make a difference. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... (pause) hold on, let me find my bill. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. And just to confirm, this is for the service at 2340 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So I'm seeing you're currently on our 100 Mbps plan. You mentioned your wife works from home—what kind of activities are you two doing that's pushing the speeds?

Customer: Well, she's on video calls all day for her job, and then I like to stream stuff in the evenings, maybe some 4K on the TV. Plus we've got the smart home stuff set up, so... yeah, it adds up pretty quick.

Agent: Yeah, video conferencing and 4K streaming definitely can compete for bandwidth. The good news is we have some great options for you. We actually just launched our fiber gigabit plan in your neighborhood about three months ago. That's 940 Mbps download speeds, which is a huge step up.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. That sounds... I mean, that sounds fast. What would that cost me?

Agent: (pause) Let me see what we can offer you. So your current plan is $79.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. Maybe eighty something?

Agent: Right, so the gigabit plan is normally $119.99 per month. But because you're a loyal customer and you're upgrading your service, I can apply a promotional rate. I can do it for $99.99 for the first twelve months, and then it goes to the regular price after that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so it's a twenty-dollar increase for the first year...

Agent: Right. And honestly, you'd get about nine to ten times faster speeds. Plus, when your wife's on calls and you're streaming, you really won't notice any slowdown anymore. Most of our gigabit customers tell us it's a game-changer.

Customer: What about the contract? Do I have to sign anything?

Agent: Good question. Our gigabit plan comes with a two-year agreement for the promotional pricing. If you cancel within that two years, there would be an early termination fee of $99. But this fiber technology is super reliable—we've got like 99.9% uptime in your area.

Customer: [inaudible] two years is... I mean, we're not planning on moving or anything, so that should be fine.

Agent: Awesome. And I should mention—since you're upgrading to gigabit fiber, the installation would be free. Our technician would come out, probably take about an hour to set everything up. We have some availability this week, actually.

Customer: This week? Like... when?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check the schedule. We have Thursday between 8 AM and 12 PM, or Friday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: Friday afternoon is better. We can do that.

Agent: Perfect. Friday between 1 and 5 PM. And just to let you know, you'll need to be home for the installation. The technician will also swap out your modem and router for our new fiber-compatible equipment.

Customer: Wait, so I get a new router too?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. You'll get our latest mesh router included with the gigabit plan—no additional cost. It's going to work much better with these speeds than the older router you probably have now.

Customer: (laughs) Yeah, it's been here since like 2019, so I'm sure an upgrade is due. Okay, um, let me just make sure I have this right. I'm going to $99.99 for twelve months, then $119.99 after?

Agent: That's correct. And just to be clear, that's the promotional rate for the gigabit plan. It's normally $119.99, so you're getting a $20 discount for the first year.

Customer: Got it. And the two-year agreement?

Agent: Two years, yeah. $99 early termination fee if you cancel within that period.

Customer: Alright, that sounds good. I think I want to do it. What happens next?

Agent: Great! I'm going to get all this set up for you right now. I'll send you a confirmation email with all the details—your new service level, the promotion, the installation appointment for Friday, and I'll include a link where you can track the technician on the day of the installation.

Customer: Perfect. Should I do anything before Friday?

Agent: Honestly, not much. Just make sure someone's going to be home. Our technician might call you about 30 minutes before they arrive, so keep your phone handy. Other than that, you're all set.

Customer: (pause) Great. Thank you so much. This was actually... I wasn't expecting it to be this easy.

Agent: (laughs) That's great to hear! We want to make it as simple as possible. Oh, one more thing—the email I'm sending you has a link to activate the promotion code, just to make sure everything goes through correctly.

Customer: Okay, I'll watch for that email.

Agent: Perfect. You should receive it within the next few minutes, but definitely check your spam folder just in case. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks again, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you Friday. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
