# Frontier Communications - Internet Upgrade Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So I'm currently a customer and I've been thinking about upgrading my internet. My current speed is, um, I think it's 100 megabits? And I'm just finding that it's getting a little slow for what I need.

Agent: Okay, great! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Just to pull up your account here... can I get the phone number associated with your account or your account number?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, and what name is the account under?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: (pause) Okay, David, I'm seeing your account here. So you're right—you're currently on our 100 Mbps fiber plan. Can I ask what's changed for you? Are you working from home now, or...?

Customer: Yeah, actually. I started working from home about eight months ago, and at first it was fine, but now I've got my wife working from home too, and we've got two kids doing school stuff online. So yeah, when everyone's home it just... it doesn't cut it anymore. Like, pages take forever to load, and the video calls are constantly buffering.

Agent: Mm-hmm, I totally understand. That's actually a really common issue we see with multiple users. With remote work and distance learning, bandwidth adds up quick. So what we have available in your area—and this is great news—we can upgrade you to our 500 Mbps plan or even our 1 Gig fiber service.

Customer: Wait, really? A gigabit? I didn't even know that was available out here.

Agent: (chuckles) Yeah, Frontier's actually been rolling out gigabit speeds to more areas recently. Your area was just upgraded, so you're lucky timing on this call. The 1 Gig is definitely overkill for most situations, but for a household like yours with multiple people online simultaneously, it's really the sweet spot. You'd have plenty of headroom.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. What's the pricing difference between the 500 and the gig?

Agent: Great question. So your current plan is $79.99 a month, right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: The 500 Mbps would be $99.99 a month, and the 1 Gig is $119.99 a month. Both of those are locked in for the first year, and then they'd go to the regular rate after that.

Customer: Hmm. So like, what would the regular rate be?

Agent: For the 1 Gig, after the first year promo, it would be $149.99 a month. For the 500, it'd be $129.99.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. That's... that's pretty high after the first year.

Agent: I understand, and I hear that from customers all the time. But here's the thing—we do run promotions regularly, so by the time that year is up, you'll typically be able to call back in and lock in another promotional rate. A lot of our long-term customers do that. And honestly, the 1 Gig speed is really future-proofed for your household.

Customer: (pause) You know what, let me ask you this. How soon could you get this installed? Because we've actually got some relatives coming in next month and they'll be staying with us, so...

Agent: That's perfect timing. So for an upgrade like this, since you already have service with us, we wouldn't need a technician to come out or anything major. We can typically activate the new speed within 24 to 48 hours, and if you have our newer equipment—which I'm checking here... (typing sounds) yes, you do—it supports those speeds no problem. So really it's just a back-end provisioning change.

Customer: Oh nice, so no technician visit?

Agent: Nope, not necessary. You'd just continue using your current equipment. Easy-peasy.

Customer: Okay, well then I think I'll go for the 1 Gig plan. If it really is that much better and we can use it right away, might as well, right?

Agent: Absolutely, I think that's a smart move. Let me just... (pause, typing sounds) okay, so I'm going to go ahead and process this upgrade for you. You should see the new rate reflected on your next billing cycle. Is the address we have on file still good? It should be 4847 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And your email is still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. So you should receive a confirmation email within the next hour or so, and then the speed upgrade will go live, again, within 24 to 48 hours. You might even want to restart your modem and router once you get the email, just to make sure everything syncs up properly.

Customer: Okay, I can do that. Um, one more quick question—is there anything else I should know? Any equipment changes or anything?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. Your modem and router are both compatible. The only thing I'd mention is that if you ever want to upgrade your WiFi equipment down the road to take full advantage of the gig speeds—sometimes older routers can be a bottleneck if you're doing wireless—but that's totally optional. A lot of customers are happy with what they have.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I think we're good for now. This is great, thank you so much.

Agent: You're very welcome, David! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Awesome. Well, thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and enjoy that faster internet with the family. You should really notice a difference.

Customer: Great, appreciate it. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, take care!
