Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on the 500 megabit plan, and honestly, I've been thinking about upgrading. My household is getting pretty heavy on the internet usage, and I feel like I'm starting to notice some slowdowns, especially during peak hours.

Agent: I completely understand. (typing sounds) Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your Frontier account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, got you here. So you're on our 500 meg plan. That's a solid plan, but I hear you—with more people working from home and streaming, those speeds can get saturated pretty quick. What kind of activities are you noticing the slowdown with?

Customer: Well, my wife works from home doing video calls, my son's always gaming, and I'm usually streaming something or working remotely too. So yeah, it's just... sometimes things lag, you know?

Agent: Yeah, that's pretty typical with three heavy users. (typing sounds) So we've got a couple options for you. We can upgrade you to our gig plan—that's one gigabit per second—or we also have an 800 meg option that's a nice middle ground if you want something more budget-friendly.

Customer: What's the difference in price between those two?

Agent: Great question. So your current 500 meg plan is $79.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, so the 800 meg would be $99.99, and the full gig plan is $119.99. But here's the thing—we're actually running a promotion right now where new speed tiers get the first three months at a discounted rate. So the gig plan would be $89.99 for the first three months, then it goes to the regular $119.99.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... that's like forty bucks more a month after the promotion ends?

Agent: Yes, but you'd be getting over double the speed. For a household like yours with multiple users, the gig plan really does make a difference. Plus, you're future-proofing yourself if your internet needs grow even more.

Customer: Hmm, what about that 800 meg option? What would that run me long-term?

Agent: The 800 meg is $99.99 ongoing, no promotional pricing on that one since it's kind of our middle tier. But honestly, with everything you've told me about your household usage, I think you'd notice a pretty significant improvement with either upgrade from the 500.

Customer: (pause) And the gig plan—that's a one gigabit? So it's definitely faster than the 800?

Agent: Yes, one full gigabit is the fastest we offer in your area. It's definitely overkill for some people, but for you with the video conferencing, gaming, and streaming all happening at once... I think you'd really appreciate it.

Customer: Can I think about it? I mean, I'm interested, but I don't want to commit to something and then [inaudible] realize I'm spending too much.

Agent: Absolutely, I get it. But let me mention—the promotion is only valid through the end of the month, so if you do want to lock in that discounted rate, you'd need to make a decision pretty soon. And honestly, there's no commitment required. Our Frontier plans are month-to-month, so you could try the gig plan at $89.99 for three months, and if it's not working out, you can always scale back or cancel.

Customer: Oh, it's month-to-month? I didn't know that.

Agent: Yep, no long-term contract. That's one of the perks of Frontier. (typing sounds) So what I can do is, if you want, I can go ahead and process the upgrade to the gig plan right now. You'd see the change take effect within the next 24 hours, and you'd just get the promotional pricing for the first three months.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah... I think let's do it. The gig plan seems like the safer bet for us.

Agent: Perfect! (typing sounds) I'm going to get that set up for you. So just to confirm—I'm upgrading your account from the 500 megabit plan to our one gigabit plan effective tomorrow. You'll see the $89.99 charge on your next billing cycle, and then it'll be $119.99 after the three-month promotion ends. Do you have any questions about that?

Customer: No, that sounds good. Will I need a new router or anything?

Agent: That's a great question. Your current equipment should be able to handle the gig speeds, but I do recommend a Wi-Fi 6 compatible router if you want to actually get those speeds wirelessly throughout your home. The router you have now might be a limiting factor.

Customer: So should I get a new one?

Agent: It depends on how old your current one is and what model you have. If you want, I can add one of our Frontier routers to your order. We have a few options, ranging from $99 to about $199 depending on the model. Or you can go with a third-party router—they tend to be cheaper and work great too.

Customer: I think I'll look into getting one separately. Don't want to add too much to my bill right now.

Agent: That makes sense. (typing sounds) Alright, I've got everything processed here. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour or so. If you have any issues once the upgrade goes live, just give us a call back and we'll get you sorted.

Customer: Great, thanks Derek.

Agent: You're welcome! Just to recap—you're all set to upgrade to our one gigabit plan tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
