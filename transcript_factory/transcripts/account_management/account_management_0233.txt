Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet. I've got the 100 meg plan right now, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've had a lot of customers looking to upgrade lately, especially with more people working from home and streaming. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I found you. So I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years on our 100 megabit plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. Three years sounds about right.

Agent: Great. So, what's driving the upgrade for you? Are you having speed issues, or is it more about future-proofing?

Customer: Well, a little bit of both, honestly. I work from home now doing video calls, and my wife streams a lot. We've got a teenager who's always on their laptop too. Like, last week I was trying to upload some files for work and it felt like it was taking forever. Plus, the router keeps cutting out in the back of the house.

Agent: Yeah, that definitely sounds frustrating. So the 100 meg plan might be a bottleneck for you, especially with multiple devices. (pause) The router issue might be separate, but let's talk about upgrading first. We've got a few options. We have our 300 megabit plan, which is a popular option, or we go up to our gigabit plan if you really want maximum speeds.

Customer: How much more would that be? I'm already paying... I think it's like $89 a month?

Agent: (typing sounds) So yes, you're on our promotional rate of $89 a month. If I can be honest, that's actually a pretty good rate. (pause) If you upgrade to the 300 meg plan, that would be $119 a month, so about a $30 increase. And the gigabit plan is $149 a month.

Customer: Hmm. So what's the difference between 300 and the gigabit? Is it really worth the extra $30?

Agent: That's a fair question. For your situation, with three devices going at once, the 300 meg plan would give you plenty of headroom. But if you think you might want future-proofing or if streaming quality is really important to you, the gigabit is future-proof for the next several years. Most people with your usage would be very happy with 300 though, I'd say.

Customer: And this is fiber, right? That's why it's so much faster?

Agent: Exactly. Our fiber network gives you much more reliable speeds than traditional cable, and there's less degradation when multiple people are using it. So you're getting consistent speeds throughout the day. (pause) When was the last time you had a technician out to check your setup?

Customer: Oh, uh... I mean, when we first got it installed, I guess? Three years ago?

Agent: (slight chuckle) Okay, so we haven't had anyone check your setup in a while. I'd actually recommend scheduling a technician visit, especially since you mentioned the router cutting out. They can make sure you've got the right equipment and optimal placement.

Customer: So that would be an extra charge?

Agent: No, actually. Since you're upgrading, we can include a complimentary technician visit to make sure everything's running smoothly. We'd need to upgrade your modem as well to support the faster speeds anyway.

Customer: Oh, that's good. (pause) Okay, so which plan do you think I should go with?

Agent: Based on what you've told me, I'd lean toward the 300 meg plan. It'll handle your household's needs really well, and you're getting a good value. If budget allows and you want that peace of mind for the future, the gigabit is never a bad call, but I don't think you need it.

Customer: Yeah, let's do the 300. That seems reasonable.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) So I'm going to make that change to your account. Your new bill would be $119 a month. I'll also get you set up with a technician visit. Are you available sometime next week? We have morning slots or afternoon slots available.

Customer: Um, I work during the day most days, but I'm usually free after like 4 or 5 PM. Do you have anything like that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see... Yes, we have a 5 to 7 PM window on Wednesday or Thursday next week. Which one works better for you?

Customer: Thursday, I think. Yeah, Thursday is better.

Agent: Great, so I've got you scheduled for Thursday, 5 to 7 PM. The technician will bring the new modem and get you all set up. You should see an email confirmation shortly at the email address we have on file. Is that still the same email?

Customer: [inaudible] Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Excellent. And just to confirm everything: you're upgrading to our 300 megabit fiber plan at $119 a month, and we've scheduled a technician visit for Thursday between 5 and 7 PM. The new speeds should start working as soon as the technician leaves. Do you have any other questions for me today?

Customer: I don't think so. This sounds good. Thanks for helping me out.

Agent: You're very welcome. We appreciate your business, and I think you're really going to notice the difference once you're upgraded. If you need anything before Thursday, just give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
