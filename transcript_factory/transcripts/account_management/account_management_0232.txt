# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet. I currently have the, um, the 100 meg plan and it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I understand completely. We've actually got some great options available right now. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account to pull up your information?

Customer: Sure, it's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you right here. So looking at your account, I can see you've been with us for about three years on that 100 meg download plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right. So what's happening is my kids are doing remote schooling now, and my wife works from home too, so like, everyone's streaming and video calling at the same time. The connection just keeps dropping.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, that's a common issue when you've got multiple devices competing for bandwidth. (pause) The good news is you're in a great location for an upgrade. We've actually got our fiber service available at your address, which is going to be a huge step up.

Customer: Wait, really? That's awesome. I didn't even know you guys offered fiber in my area.

Agent: Yeah, it just rolled out to your neighborhood about six months ago. So right now I can get you set up with either our 300 meg fiber plan or our gigabit plan, which is one thousand megs per second. Which one sounds more appealing to you?

Customer: Wow, okay, um... what's the difference in price? Like, how much more would I be paying?

Agent: (typing sounds) Good question. So you're currently at $79.99 a month for the 100 meg plan. The 300 meg fiber plan would be $99.99, so just a twenty dollar increase. And then the gigabit plan, that's $129.99.

Customer: Okay, and what about... do I have any kind of contract? Because I remember when I signed up, there was like a two-year thing or something.

Agent: Let me check that for you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so you're actually month-to-month right now, which is great. You're not locked into anything, so you could upgrade whenever. However, if you upgrade today, I can actually lock you into the 300 meg plan at $99.99 for the first year, and then it goes to our regular price after that.

Customer: Oh, that's... that's not bad actually. And what about the installation? Do I have to have someone come out?

Agent: That's a great question. So with fiber, we do need to do a professional installation to set everything up properly. But here's the thing—I can actually waive the $99 installation fee if you upgrade today. It's a promotional offer we're running.

Customer: Seriously? Okay, yeah, that's a pretty good deal. Um, what would be the timeline on that? How soon could someone come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me pull up our availability. (pause) So looking at next week, we've got openings on Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday. The Saturday appointment would be between 8 AM and noon. Does any of those work for you?

Customer: Saturday morning would be perfect, actually. That way I don't have to try and wrangle the kids and tell them to be quiet for their classes. (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) I totally understand. Alright, so let me just confirm the details here. We're upgrading you to the 300 meg fiber plan at $99.99 for the first year, waiving the $99 installation fee, and we've got you scheduled for Saturday, March 14th between 8 AM and noon. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Do I need to do anything to prepare or...?

Agent: So the tech will bring everything they need, but just make sure you have access to the area where your modem will be installed. Usually that's in a utility closet or wherever your current equipment is. And just a heads up, the installation typically takes about an hour to an hour and a half.

Customer: Okay, got it. And this new plan, it's going to work with my existing router or...?

Agent: You know, that's a good question. So with the fiber upgrade, we'll be providing you with a new modem, and we actually have a really solid router built into it. But if you've already got a nice standalone router you like, you can definitely still use that with the modem. The tech can show you how to set it all up on Saturday.

Customer: Great, I appreciate that. So is there anything else I need to know or...?

Agent: I think we've covered everything! Oh, one thing—you'll get a confirmation email here in just a moment with all your appointment details and the service address. Just make sure to check that. And if you need to reschedule for any reason, you can call us or do it right through your online account.

Customer: Perfect. Yeah, this has been really helpful, Marcus. Thanks for walking me through everything.

Agent: My pleasure! And hey, you're gonna be really happy with the fiber service. The speed difference is night and day compared to what you've got now. If you have any questions before Saturday, feel free to give us a call back. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again!

Agent: Alright, thank you for choosing Frontier, and we'll see you Saturday morning!

Customer: Sounds good. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
