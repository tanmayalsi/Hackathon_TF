# Frontier Communications - Upgrade Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've had the same plan for like... three years now, and it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I totally understand. We've actually expanded our fiber offerings quite a bit recently. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. A hundred megs. And honestly, it was great when I first got it, but now with my kids doing remote school and my wife working from home... it's been pretty frustrating. We're constantly buffering.

Agent: Oh yeah, that's actually one of the most common reasons people upgrade. Especially with multiple people streaming or on video calls at the same time. (pause) So what kind of speeds were you thinking about?

Customer: I don't know... what do you recommend? Like, how much better could I go?

Agent: Well, depending on your address, we have a few options. We offer Fiber 300, which is three hundred megs, and that's usually really solid for a household with a couple people working from home. Then we also have Fiber 500 and Fiber 1000 if you want to go even higher. (typing sounds) Let me check what's available at your location.

Customer: Okay, um... what's the price difference? I'm on a fixed income right now, so I need to know what I'm looking at.

Agent: Of course, that's an important question. (pause) So good news—you're in a great service area. All three of those higher tiers are available to you. Your Fiber 100 is currently... looks like it's $49.99 a month?

Customer: Yeah, something like that.

Agent: Right. So the Fiber 300 would be $69.99. That's a twenty dollar jump. Then Fiber 500 is $89.99, and our Fiber 1000 gig plan is $119.99 per month.

Customer: (pause) Wow, okay. So that's quite a bit more. Is there any like... discount or promotion going on? I've been a customer for a while.

Agent: That's a great question, and I appreciate your loyalty. (typing sounds) Let me see what I can find here. We do have some current promotions... (pause) Alright, so I'm seeing we have a loyalty offer for existing customers. I can get you the Fiber 300 for $59.99 a month for the first twelve months, and then it goes to the regular price. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh, that's better. That's... yeah, that's more reasonable. And that includes everything? No hidden fees or anything?

Agent: No, that's the price. There will be your standard equipment fee—that's about five bucks a month for the modem and router rental—and then of course your taxes, but those are the main costs. We don't charge any installation fee for upgrades on existing service areas.

Customer: Okay, and when could someone come out? Or... do I need someone to come out? I already have the router thing.

Agent: (typing) That's a good question. Since you're already set up with fiber service, most times we can actually do a remote upgrade. Your modem might need a firmware update, which we can push to it remotely, and it should take effect pretty quickly. Usually within a couple hours.

Customer: Oh, really? That's... that's actually great. I was worried I'd have to take time off work.

Agent: I know, it's one of the nice perks. (pause) However, just to be transparent, depending on your existing equipment, we might need to send you a new modem if yours isn't compatible with the higher speeds. Let me check... (typing sounds) What model modem do you have?

Customer: Um, I'm not sure. It's just... it's the white box thing they gave me.

Agent: (chuckling) That's usually the description I get. No worries. When you upgrade, we'll check on our end and if you need a new one, we'll mail it out to you. Typically arrives within three to five business days.

Customer: Okay, that works. So... should I do the 300 or go bigger?

Agent: Honestly? For your situation—two kids, remote school, two people working from home—I'd say the 300 is going to be a really solid upgrade from where you are now. You'll notice a huge difference. The 500 would be if you wanted to future-proof more, but 300 should handle what you're doing now without any issues.

Customer: Alright, let's do it. Let's go with the 300. That price you mentioned?

Agent: Perfect. (typing) So that's Fiber 300 at $59.99 a month for twelve months, then $69.99 after. Equipment fee is five dollars a month. And you should be good to go either today or by tomorrow, depending on system updates. (pause) Just let me confirm the details here. Your service address is still 2847 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: (typing) Great. And your billing email is [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Awesome. So I'm going to go ahead and process this upgrade for you now. (typing sounds) It should take just a moment... and... there we go. Your new plan is active as of right now. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes, and it'll have all the details about your new service and your billing information.

Customer: Great, I really appreciate it. How long until I notice the difference?

Agent: Well, like I said, if we don't need to send you a new modem, you could see it as soon as today or tomorrow morning. The system will update and you should definitely feel that speed bump right away, especially with the streaming and video calls.

Customer: Excellent. And if there's any issue, I can just call back?

Agent: Absolutely. We're available 24/7. Just have your account number handy when you call—that'll be in your confirmation email—and we'll get you taken care of. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks so much, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and enjoy that faster internet!

Customer: Will do. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Take care!
