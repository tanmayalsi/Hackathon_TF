Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I currently have the 100 megabit plan, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're on our Fiber 100 plan. And you mentioned it's not meeting your needs anymore?

Customer: Right, so like, I've been working from home more now, and my partner is streaming stuff, and our daughter's always on video calls for school. Honestly, the speeds just lag sometimes, you know? I don't want to deal with it anymore.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. That's actually pretty common, especially with multiple people on the network doing different things. (pause) So, great news—since you're already in one of our fiber service areas, you've got some really solid options to upgrade to. We offer 500 megabits, our 1 gigabit plan, and actually, we just rolled out a 2 gigabit option in your area.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. Um... what's the difference between the 500 and 1 gigabit? Like, would I really notice a difference?

Agent: That's a great question. So with 500 megs, you'd have more than enough headroom for what you're describing—streaming, work calls, all that. But the gigabit plan? That's really the sweet spot for future-proofing your home. It handles everything simultaneously without any slowdown. Plus, if you add more devices down the road, you're covered.

Customer: How much more is that gonna run me a month?

Agent: (typing sounds) So, your current plan is $59.99 a month, right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, so if you upgrade to our Fiber 500, that would be $79.99 a month. The Fiber 1 gig plan is $99.99. And honestly, we're running a promotion right now where if you commit to a two-year agreement, we can knock it down to $84.99 for the first year.

Customer: For the gigabit plan?

Agent: Yes, exactly. For the full gigabit plan. That's a pretty solid deal.

Customer: (pause) That's not too bad. Um, and there's no installation fee or anything like that?

Agent: Well, so normally there would be a $99 installation fee, but because you're already a customer and you're upgrading, we can waive that completely. We'll just send a tech out to upgrade your equipment, and it's all included.

Customer: Oh, nice. Okay, so... (trailing off) how long does that take?

Agent: Installation usually takes about an hour, sometimes a little less depending on your setup. And we can get you scheduled as early as tomorrow if you'd like, or we can find something that works better with your schedule.

Customer: Tomorrow works. What time?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check what we have available. We've got a morning window between 8 AM and 12 PM, or an afternoon window from 1 PM to 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Morning's better. I've got stuff in the afternoon.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to lock you in for the morning window tomorrow. The tech will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive to confirm. 

Customer: Great. And just to clarify, it's just the equipment swap, right? I don't need to do anything?

Agent: Exactly. The technician will take care of everything. They'll upgrade your modem, make sure all the connections are good, run a speed test to verify everything's working correctly, and they'll also answer any questions you have about the new equipment.

Customer: Awesome. What else... oh, do I need to do anything with my current modem?

Agent: (pause) The tech will actually pick that up while they're there, so you don't have to worry about returning it separately.

Customer: Oh perfect. Okay, I think that's everything. So just to recap, I'm going to the gigabit plan at $84.99 for the first year, then it goes to $99.99, and installation is free. Tomorrow morning?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yep, you've got it. Your new rate is $84.99 per month for the first 12 months with the two-year agreement, then it adjusts to $99.99 after that. Installation is waived, and we have you scheduled for tomorrow morning between 8 AM and noon. A tech will call you about 30 minutes before arrival.

Customer: Excellent. Thanks, Marcus, this was quick and easy.

Agent: You're very welcome! We really appreciate your business, and we're excited to get you set up with that gigabit service tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, and we'll see you tomorrow morning!

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
