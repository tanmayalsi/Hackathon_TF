Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on the 100 meg plan and I'm thinking about upgrading. My kids are doing school from home now and we're streaming a lot more, so... I think we need something faster.

Agent: I completely understand. More people working and learning from home definitely puts a strain on bandwidth. (typing sounds) Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you mentioned you're on our 100 meg plan currently. Are you experiencing any slowdowns or buffering issues?

Customer: Yeah, actually. Like, my wife will be on a Zoom call for work and my son's doing online classes, and when my daughter tries to stream Netflix in her room it just... it basically tanks everything. The internet gets really spotty.

Agent: Yeah, that sounds frustrating. So with multiple heavy users, 100 megs can definitely get bottlenecked. The good news is we have a couple of great options for you. We've actually got our 400 meg fiber plan, which would be ideal for a household like yours, and we're running a promotion on that right now.

Customer: Oh really? What's the promotion?

Agent: So through the end of the month, we're offering the 400 meg plan at $79.99 a month for the first year, then it goes to our standard rate of $89.99 after that. And there's no installation fee since you're already a customer with us. We'd just need to schedule a technician to come out and upgrade your modem and make sure everything's properly configured.

Customer: Okay, that's not too bad. What about... do you have anything faster than that? I mean, if we're going to do this...

Agent: (pause) Absolutely, that's a great question. We do have our gig plan—that's 1000 megs per second. That's $129.99 a month for the first year, and again, the installation is waived for existing customers.

Customer: Wow, okay. That seems like... I mean, is that overkill for what we need?

Agent: (chuckles) Well, it depends on your usage. For most households with four to five people streaming, video conferencing, gaming, all that—the 400 meg plan is typically plenty. But if you think your needs might grow, or if you want that extra cushion, the gig plan is really the future-proof option. Plus, at $129.99, it's not a huge jump from the 400 meg.

Customer: How much is my bill going up from what I'm paying now?

Agent: (typing sounds) So you're currently on the 100 meg plan at... $59.99 a month. If you go with the 400 meg at the promotional rate, that's $79.99, so about a $20 increase. But honestly, for three times the speed and the ability to handle all those simultaneous connections, that's a really good value.

Customer: Yeah, no, I get it. Let me... can I think about it for a day or two?

Agent: Of course, of course. I'm happy to hold this promotion for you, but I do want to mention that this promotional rate expires at the end of the month, so you'd want to get that ordered before then to lock in that price.

Customer: Okay, so end of the month is the deadline?

Agent: That's right. And whenever you're ready, you can just give us a call back, or you can actually order it through our website or the Frontier app if you prefer.

Customer: Perfect. Actually, you know what? Let me... I'm going to go with the 400 meg plan. My wife's going to kill me if I don't fix this internet situation soon. (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) I hear you. Okay, great choice! Let me just set this up for you. (typing sounds) So I'm going to schedule you for an upgrade appointment. What day this week would work best for you? We have availability tomorrow afternoon, or we can do Wednesday or Thursday morning.

Customer: Uh, tomorrow afternoon would be perfect actually. What time?

Agent: Let me check... we have a window between 1 PM and 5 PM tomorrow. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. That's fine.

Agent: (typing sounds) Excellent. You're all set. So that's tomorrow, between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will come out, upgrade your equipment, and you should be up and running on the 400 meg plan by tomorrow evening. Your new rate of $79.99 will be reflected on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Perfect. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home to let the technician in. They'll typically need access to your modem and router area. Other than that, you're all set. You'll get a confirmation text and email with the appointment details.

Customer: Great, Marcus. Thanks so much for your help.

Agent: My pleasure! Thanks for being a valued Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. If you have any questions between now and tomorrow, just give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now.
