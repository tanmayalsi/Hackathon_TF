Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So I'm currently a customer and I've been looking to upgrade my internet service. My current plan is just... I think it's like 500 megabits or something? And I'm finding that it's just not cutting it anymore, especially with working from home now.

Agent: Absolutely, I understand. Working from home definitely puts more demands on your connection. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got it. And just for verification, can you confirm the name on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: Great, Jennifer. Okay, so I'm seeing here you're currently on our Fiber 500 plan at $79.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. It's been fine for a while, but like I said, with everything I'm doing now—video calls all day, my husband's also working from home, and we've got the kids streaming stuff... it's just getting bogged down, you know?

Agent: Oh yeah, absolutely. Multiple devices streaming and video conferencing will definitely max out a 500 meg connection pretty quickly. The good news is we have some fantastic options available at your address. We can get you set up with our Fiber 1 Gigabit plan, which is ten times faster. That's ideal for heavy usage like what you're describing.

Customer: Okay, so like how much faster would that actually be? I mean, in real terms?

Agent: Great question. So with your current 500 megabit plan, you're splitting that bandwidth among all your devices. With 1 Gigabit—that's 1,000 megabits—you'd have double the speed, so everyone in your household could stream, video conference, work, all at the same time without experiencing slowdowns or buffering.

Customer: That does sound pretty good. What's the price difference?

Agent: (pause) So our Fiber 1 Gig plan is regularly $109.99 a month, which would be $30 more than what you're currently paying. However, we actually have a promotional rate right now for existing customers who upgrade. We can get you that plan for $99.99 a month for the first 12 months, and then it goes to the regular rate after that.

Customer: So that's like, what, $20 more a month for the first year?

Agent: Exactly right. And honestly, with the performance improvement you'll see, most customers find it's well worth it. Plus, there's no installation fee for the upgrade since you already have our fiber line running to your home.

Customer: Oh nice. So I wouldn't need a technician to come out or anything?

Agent: Nope. We'd just need to push a configuration update to your modem remotely. You'd actually see the speed increase pretty much immediately. The whole process takes maybe five minutes.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. That's way easier than I thought it'd be. Um, can I ask—is there any option to go higher? Like, what if we wanted even more speed?

Agent: (typing sounds) Sure, absolutely. We also offer a Fiber 2 Gig plan, which is 2 gigabits per second. That's really for people with, you know, very heavy usage—like multiple people streaming 4K video, lots of gaming, a lot of data uploads. That one runs $149.99 monthly.

Customer: Hmm, I don't think we need to go that high. The 1 Gig sounds like it'd be perfect for us.

Agent: I think you'll be really happy with that choice. Let me just make sure—are you looking to keep everything else the same on your account? Your service address, billing information...?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, all that's the same.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and process this upgrade for you right now. I've got you down for the Fiber 1 Gigabit plan at $99.99 monthly for the first year, promotional rate. After that first year, it'll be $109.99. And I'm not charging any upgrade fees or installation fees.

Customer: Great, thank you.

Agent: You should see the speed increase within the next hour or so once we push that configuration update through. Now, do you want me to email you a confirmation of these changes, or would you prefer it mailed to you?

Customer: Email is fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm sending that to the email on file right now. (pause, typing sounds) Done. You should receive that within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. This was really helpful. Thanks so much.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and enjoy that speedy connection! Have a great day.

Customer: You too, bye!

Agent: Bye now!
