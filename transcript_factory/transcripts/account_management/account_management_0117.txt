# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on the, um, the 300 meg plan? And I've been thinking about upgrading. My internet's been pretty good, but I work from home now and I could use something faster.

Agent: Oh, awesome! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Let me just pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're on our 300 megabit plan currently, and you've been with us for about two years. Nice. And you mentioned you work from home? That definitely makes sense why you'd want to bump up the speed.

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I'm doing a lot of video conferencing, uploading files, that kind of thing. Sometimes my partner's streaming in the other room too, so it gets a little sluggish.

Agent: Yeah, that's actually a really common scenario. Multiple devices going at once can definitely max out 300 megs. So good news—we have a couple of excellent options for you. We offer 500 megabits, which is our mid-tier plan, and then we also have our gigabit fiber service, which is one gig. That's gonna be our fastest option.

Customer: Okay, so... what's the price difference? I don't want to go crazy, but I also want something that actually works, you know?

Agent: (pause) Totally understandable. So right now, you're paying... looks like $79.99 a month for the 300 meg plan. Our 500 meg plan would be $99.99 a month, so that's about $20 more. And the one gig plan is $129.99 a month.

Customer: Hmm. And what's the difference in speed again? Like, how much faster are we talking?

Agent: Right, so the 500 meg plan is literally just under double your current speed. The one gig plan—that's one thousand megabits—so you're getting over three times faster than what you have now. For your use case with the video conferencing and file uploads and your partner streaming, honestly, the 500 meg would probably be solid. But the gig would future-proof you even more if you want that extra headroom.

Customer: Is there any kind of promotional pricing or... I don't know, a deal if I sign up for a longer contract or something?

Agent: That's a great question. (typing sounds) Let me see what I can find for you. Okay, so we do have a promotion going on right now. If you upgrade today, I can lock you in at $99.99 for the first year on the 500 meg plan, and then it goes to $109.99 after that. Or if you go with the gig plan, I can do $119.99 for the first twelve months.

Customer: So that's like, $10 off the gig plan for the first year? That's not too bad, actually.

Agent: Exactly. And honestly, that's [inaudible] people are really happy with. Plus there's no equipment fee for the upgrade—we'll just send you a new router and modem if you need it, totally free.

Customer: Oh, really? I might actually need that. My router's pretty old at this point. (pause) Okay, I think I'm leaning toward the 500 meg plan. Let me think... can I upgrade and then change my mind later if I need the gig?

Agent: Absolutely. You're not locked into anything. You can call back anytime and make changes to your plan. The only thing I would mention is that promotional pricing is specific to when you sign up, so if you decided later that you want to upgrade to the gig, you'd be looking at the regular pricing at that point. But there's no penalty for upgrading now.

Customer: Got it. Yeah, okay, let's do it. Let's do the 500 meg plan.

Agent: Awesome! Great choice. (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm gonna get you set up here. The upgrade will take effect on your next billing cycle, which looks like... that's gonna be next Thursday, the 14th. And we'll send out the new equipment within the next few business days. You should have everything by the time the plan changes over.

Customer: Do I need to do anything with the old equipment, or...?

Agent: Good question. Yeah, so when the new stuff arrives, it'll come with a prepaid return label. You just pack up your old modem and router, slap that label on there, and drop it off at any UPS location. We'll get it back that way.

Customer: Perfect. And when does the new equipment arrive?

Agent: So it's usually three to five business days. Since you're calling on a Tuesday, I'd estimate... probably by end of week or early next week at the latest. We'll send you a tracking number via email and text, so you'll know exactly when it's showing up.

Customer: Great, thanks for that. So my bill changes next Thursday?

Agent: Yep, next Thursday the 14th is when the new rate kicks in. Your first billing cycle at 500 megs will be $99.99. And after that, it'll be $109.99 monthly. Oh, and I'm also gonna add a courtesy service call to your account if you need help setting up the new equipment. You can schedule that whenever it arrives.

Customer: That's nice. I'll probably be able to handle it myself, but good to know.

Agent: I totally get it. Most people can plug it in and they're good to go. But if you run into any hiccups, just call us back. (pause) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. This was pretty painless, actually. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: Hey, my pleasure! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being a loyal customer. Enjoy that extra speed—you're gonna love it. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
