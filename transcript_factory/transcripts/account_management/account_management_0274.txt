Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So I'm currently on your 100 meg fiber plan, and I've been pretty happy with it, but honestly, we've been working from home a lot more now, and my wife's been complaining that things are getting slow when we're both on video calls at the same time.

Agent: I completely understand. That's actually a pretty common situation we're hearing about these days. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Okay, I'm looking at your account here. You've been with us since 2019, great customer. And yes, I see you're on the Fiber 100 plan. So just to clarify, when you say things are slowing down, are you experiencing buffering, lag, or is it more just bandwidth issues when multiple devices are active?

Customer: Yeah, it's like the connection just gets really choppy when we're both streaming video. Like, hers will pixelate or mine will drop. It's frustrating because the internet seems fast enough when it's just me using it.

Agent: Got it. That definitely sounds like a bandwidth limitation. The good news is, you're actually in one of our areas that we've recently expanded our fiber service to, and we have some excellent upgrade options available. What speeds do you think would work best for your household? Are you thinking maybe 300 megs, or would you want to go bigger?

Customer: Um... I'm not really sure? What would you recommend? Is it a big jump in price?

Agent: (pause) Great question. So the Fiber 100 is one of our entry-level plans. We offer 300, 500, and our premium Fiber Gig service at one gigabit per second. For a situation like yours with two people working from home simultaneously, I'd honestly recommend starting with the 300 meg plan. It gives you plenty of headroom for multiple video conferences, streaming, and everything else without being overkill.

Customer: Okay, what's the price difference?

Agent: (typing sounds) So your current plan is $79.99 a month. The Fiber 300 would be $109.99 a month, so about thirty dollars more. And I should mention, we're actually running a promotion right now where you'd get that rate locked in for the first year. After that, it'd be subject to our normal pricing, but you'd have at least twelve months at that rate guaranteed.

Customer: That's... actually not too bad. What about the installation? Would I need to have someone come out, or can you just flip a switch or something?

Agent: (chuckling) I wish it was that simple. Since you're already on fiber, we would need to send a technician out to upgrade your equipment and make sure everything's calibrated for the higher speeds. It's usually a pretty quick visit, maybe 30 to 45 minutes. We have appointment availability... let me see... (typing sounds) we have some slots open on Thursday or Friday of this week, or early next week if that works better for you.

Customer: Uh, this Friday would be ideal. What time can you do?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, for this Friday, we have a morning slot between 8 and 10 AM, or an afternoon slot between 1 and 3 PM.

Customer: Morning works better. That's the 8 to 10 slot?

Agent: Perfect, I've got you down for Friday, 8 to 10 AM. (pause) Just a heads up, your internet service will be down during the installation, so you might want to plan accordingly if you or your wife have any early meetings.

Customer: Oh, wow, it'll be completely down? For how long?

Agent: It'll be during that window, but it should be back up and running by the time the tech leaves. Usually the whole thing is pretty smooth. If for some reason it takes longer, they'll let you know. We'll also send you a confirmation text and email with all the details and a link to track the technician.

Customer: Okay, okay. That works. Um, so just to confirm, it's the 300 meg plan for $109.99?

Agent: Correct. Fiber 300 at $109.99 a month for the first year, then regular pricing applies after that. (typing sounds) And just so you know, there is a $99 installation fee that would be charged to your account, but that's waived if you sign a two-year agreement with us.

Customer: A two-year agreement? (hesitating) I don't know... is that something I have to do, or...?

Agent: No, no, it's totally optional. But it does waive that installation fee, so it saves you a hundred bucks upfront. A lot of customers like the peace of mind knowing their rate is locked in for that period, but I understand it's a commitment. It's really whatever works best for your situation.

Customer: You know what, yeah, let's do the two-year agreement. That makes sense.

Agent: Excellent choice. (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm going to send this over as a new service order. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour with all the details—your appointment Friday morning, the service change, everything. Is the email address on file still current?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine. It's [inaudible]@gmail.com, right?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, that's what I have here. Perfect. So just to recap everything: you're upgrading to Fiber 300 service at $109.99 per month with a two-year agreement, waiving the installation fee. Technician appointment Friday, 8 to 10 AM. Installation takes about 30 to 45 minutes, and your service will be down during that window. Any questions for me before we wrap up?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for walking me through all this. I'm really looking forward to having better internet for work.

Agent: You're very welcome! And honestly, I think you're going to see a huge difference, especially with those simultaneous video calls. If you have any issues after the tech leaves or need anything at all, just give us a call back. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks again, Marcus.

Agent: You got it. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
