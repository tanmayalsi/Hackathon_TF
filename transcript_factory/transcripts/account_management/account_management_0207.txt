Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with your service, but I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: That's great to hear you've been satisfied with us. I'd be happy to help you explore upgrade options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's area code 503, then 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for your residential address on Maple Street in Portland?

Customer: Yes, that's the one.

Agent: Excellent. So you're currently on our Fiber 200 plan, which gives you 200 megabits per second download speeds. What kind of activities are you finding you need more speed for?

Customer: Well, my wife and I are both working from home now, and we've got two kids who are constantly streaming, doing homework online... it's just getting really slow, you know? Like, I'll be on a Zoom call and it'll freeze up, or someone's downloading something and then everything bogs down.

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally understand. That sounds like you're hitting your bandwidth limits with multiple users. How many devices would you say are connected at the same time on average?

Customer: Honestly? Probably like six or seven. Two laptops for work, tablets, phones, the smart TV... it adds up quick.

Agent: Definitely. With that kind of usage, I'd recommend looking at our Fiber 500 or even our Fiber 1 Gig plan. The 500 would give you 500 megabits per second, which should handle multiple video calls and streaming without the slowdowns. Or if you want that real peace of mind, the Fiber 1 Gig gives you gigabit speeds—that's 1,000 megabits per second. (pause) Where are you located in Portland, by the way? I want to make sure those speeds are available at your address.

Customer: We're... actually, we moved about six months ago. We're on the west side now, near Forest Park. Does that matter?

Agent: It can, yeah. Fiber availability does depend on the specific address. Let me just pull up your current service address... (typing sounds) And what's the new address?

Customer: It's 4782 Southwest Burnside Road.

Agent: (typing sounds, longer pause) Okay, let me check the availability there. Just give me one second...

Customer: No problem.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm showing that we have Fiber service available at that location, which is fantastic. And we can actually upgrade you there as well. So you have a couple of options. You could stick with where you are now, or I could get you started on Fiber 500 or Fiber 1 Gig.

Customer: What's the price difference? I mean, I don't want to go crazy, but if it fixes the problem...

Agent: I totally get it. So your current rate for Fiber 200 is $79.99 a month for the first year, and then it goes to $99.99. For Fiber 500, I can get you that for $99.99 a month for the first year, then $129.99 after that. And Fiber 1 Gig would be $149.99 for the first year, then $179.99.

Customer: Hmm... and this is just internet, right? You're not bundling it with anything?

Agent: Yes, this is internet only. Though if you're interested, we also offer TV or phone services that could potentially bring down your overall cost with a bundle discount. Do you have phone or TV with us currently?

Customer: No, we've got our cell phones, and we're using streaming services instead of cable. I think internet only is what we want.

Agent: Totally fair. So for your situation, I'd actually recommend the Fiber 500 plan. It's a significant jump from your current 200, and it should easily handle the four to five concurrent users you'd have during peak times. The 1 Gig is amazing if you think you'll need it down the line, but 500 is probably the sweet spot for your needs right now.

Customer: Yeah, that sounds reasonable. How long is the contract or anything like that?

Agent: Great question. Our Fiber plans come with a two-year price guarantee, meaning your rate won't increase during those two years. After that, standard rates would apply. There's no early termination fee if you decide to leave, but we do have a service agreement for the equipment we provide.

Customer: Okay, that works for me. So what do I need to do? Will I need to get a new modem or anything?

Agent: Good question. You'll keep your current modem since it's compatible with the upgraded speed, so there's no hardware change needed. The upgrade should take effect within one to two business days, and we can do this all over the phone right now if you'd like.

Customer: Really? That's easier than I thought. Yeah, let's do it.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) So I'm going to upgrade you from Fiber 200 to Fiber 500, effective tomorrow, September 19th. Your new rate is $99.99 per month for the first 12 months. I'm also adding a promotional credit of $20 off for the first month as a loyalty thank you, so your first bill will be $79.99.

Customer: Oh, nice! I appreciate that.

Agent: Of course. Now, we do need to confirm a couple things for the account. Is the billing address still the same as the service address?

Customer: Actually no, the billing address is different. We get mail at a PO box.

Agent: No problem. What's the PO box number?

Customer: It's PO Box 1847, Portland, Oregon 97209.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. And the phone number on the account is still 503-555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And I'm going to send you a confirmation email to the address we have on file. Is [inaudible] still the current email?

Customer: Uh, I'm not sure which one you said. Can you repeat that?

Agent: Of course. Is sarah.martinez@email.com still current?

Customer: Yeah, that's good.

Agent: Excellent. So to recap: you're upgrading to Fiber 500, 500 megabits per second, $99.99 monthly for the first year, then $129.99 after that. You'll save $20 on your first bill. The service upgrade is active tomorrow. You'll receive a confirmation email within the hour, and if you have any issues after the upgrade, just give us a call back and we'll troubleshoot.

Customer: That sounds great. I really appreciate your help, Marcus. I think this is going to make a huge difference.

Agent: Happy to help! You should see a pretty dramatic improvement once everything kicks in tomorrow. And hey, if you ever think about adding phone or TV down the line, just reach out and we can look at bundle options. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your business. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
