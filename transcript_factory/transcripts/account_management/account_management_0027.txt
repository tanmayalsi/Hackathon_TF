Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've had your internet service for about three years now, and I'm really happy with it, but I'm thinking I might need to upgrade. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Oh, awesome! I'm glad you've been happy with us. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... uh... (pause) 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... perfect, I've got you. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right. A hundred megabits or whatever.

Agent: Right, so 100 Mbps download speeds. And what's been going on? Are you experiencing slower speeds, or is it more about future-proofing?

Customer: Well, I work from home now—I didn't used to—and my wife streams a lot. Like, Netflix and stuff. And our kids are always on their tablets doing schoolwork or gaming. So when everyone's online at the same time, everything just gets really slow and laggy.

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally understand. That's actually really common with multiple devices and streaming. So you're looking at probably three to four devices running simultaneously?

Customer: Yeah, at least. Sometimes more if friends are over.

Agent: Okay, perfect. So we have a few upgrade options for you. We've got Fiber 200, which doubles your current speed to 200 Mbps. Then we have Fiber 500, which is 500 Mbps, and then our top tier is Fiber 1 Gig, which is one gigabit per second. (pause) For your situation with multiple users and streaming, I'd probably recommend either the 500 or the 1 Gig, just to make sure you've got plenty of headroom.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference in price? Like, what am I paying now versus what I'd be paying?

Agent: (typing sounds) So you're currently on Fiber 100 at $79.99 per month. The Fiber 500 would be $119.99 a month, and the Fiber 1 Gig is $159.99 a month.

Customer: Hmm, okay. (pause) And that's for how long?

Agent: So that would be the promotional pricing for the first twelve months. After that, it would go to $139.99 for the 500 or $179.99 for the 1 Gig.

Customer: What about the 200 Mbps option? How much is that?

Agent: The 200 would be $99.99 for the first year, then $119.99 after that. (pause) Now, I don't want to oversell you, but honestly, if you're already struggling with 100 Mbps with multiple users, the 200 might still feel a little tight. Especially with gaming and streaming at the same time.

Customer: Yeah, that's fair. I don't want to just do this and still have problems, you know? Maybe the 500 would be the sweet spot?

Agent: I think that's a really solid choice. You'll have plenty of speed for everything you're doing, and it's a good value.

Customer: Okay, cool. Um, and there's no installation fee or anything, right? Like, I already have the fiber in my house.

Agent: Right, so since you're an existing customer with fiber already installed, there's no installation fee. We'd just need to send a technician to upgrade your equipment. That would be free, and it usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes. 

Customer: Oh nice. When could that happen?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... (pause) Looks like we have some openings tomorrow between 10 AM and 2 PM, or we have Thursday morning as well. What works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow would be great, actually. Morning is better for me.

Agent: Perfect. So let me just confirm—tomorrow between 10 AM and 2 PM. We'll send a technician to upgrade your gateway and get you switched over to the Fiber 500 plan. Your new speed should kick in right away after they're done.

Customer: Awesome. Do I need to be home the whole time?

Agent: Yeah, they'll need you or someone at home to let them in, and then they'll test everything once it's installed to make sure it's working properly. Shouldn't take too long though.

Customer: Okay, perfect. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: Just to let you know, your first bill will reflect the upgrade, but you'll get the promotional pricing at $119.99 starting next month. And you can always check your speeds afterward at frontier.com—there's a speed test tool there if you want to verify everything is working correctly.

Customer: Great, thanks. And just to make sure—this is all wireless, right? Like I don't need to buy a new router or anything?

Agent: (pause) Actually, that's a good question. So the gateway we provide does have a built-in WiFi 6 router, and honestly, it's pretty robust. For most homes, that should be plenty. If you do have like a really large house or a lot of dead zones, you might want to think about a mesh system down the road, but you shouldn't need to upgrade right away.

Customer: Okay, no, my house is just a regular size, so that should be fine. Alright, I think I'm good.

Agent: Perfect. Just to recap everything—you're upgrading to Fiber 500 at $119.99 a month for the first year. Technician visit tomorrow between 10 and 2 PM, and there's no installation fee. We'll send you a confirmation email with all the details and a tracking number for the visit. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds great. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for being such a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. If you have any questions before the technician arrives, just give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
