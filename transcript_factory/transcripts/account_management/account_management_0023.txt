Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Marcus. So, um, I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My speeds have been pretty slow lately, and I'm working from home now, so I really need something faster.

Agent: I completely understand. Working from home definitely requires a solid connection. I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan—that's 100 megabits per second download. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine before, but now with me doing Zoom calls all day and my roommate streaming stuff... it just feels like everything's lagging. I need more bandwidth or whatever.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. Multiple users can definitely eat up that bandwidth fast. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you thinking you'd need? Do you know roughly how much faster you're looking for?

Customer: Uh, I'm not totally sure. What's the next step up?

Agent: Great question. So we have a few options. We offer Fiber 300, which is 300 megabits per second, Fiber 500, and then our top tier is Fiber Gig, which is 1 gigabit per second. For your situation with Zoom calls and streaming happening simultaneously, I'd probably recommend the Fiber 500. That's a pretty sweet spot for multiple users.

Customer: Okay, and how much more is that going to cost me? Like, what's the price difference?

Agent: (typing sounds) So you're currently at $79.99 a month for the Fiber 100. The Fiber 500 would be $119.99 a month for the first year with our promotional rate. After that, it goes to $139.99. Does that sound like something that would work for you?

Customer: (pause) That's... okay, I guess. I mean, that's about $40 more a month, right? But like, is it worth it? Will I definitely notice a difference?

Agent: Absolutely, you will. You'll see a huge difference, honestly. Going from 100 to 500 megabits, that's five times faster. Your Zoom calls will be crystal clear, no buffering or lag, and your roommate can stream in 4K without affecting your connection. Plus, the fiber network is really reliable—you'll have minimal downtime.

Customer: Okay, that does sound pretty good. (pause) Are there any installation fees or anything like that?

Agent: Great question. Since you're already a Fiber customer at that address, we won't need to do any new installations. It's just a plan upgrade, so there's no installation fee. We can push this through and you'd be switched over within 24 to 48 hours, typically.

Customer: Oh nice, so I don't have to wait around for a technician or anything?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. It's just a backend change on our end. You might experience a brief moment where your internet drops—maybe 30 seconds to a minute—but that's it. It'll happen automatically.

Customer: That's awesome. Okay, I think I want to do it. Let's upgrade to the 500.

Agent: Perfect! I'm really glad we could find a solution for you. (typing sounds) So I'm going to process this upgrade right now. Let me just confirm a few details with you. Your address is still 1847 Maple Street, apartment 3B?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: And the best phone number to reach you if we need to is the one you called from?

Customer: Um, actually, can you use my cell? It's 555-0291.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it, I'm updating that now. And just to confirm, this will be on your existing billing, so your payment method on file—the Visa ending in 4782—that's still good?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Excellent. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm showing here that your upgrade has been processed. You're all set! You should see the speed increase within the next 24 hours. You might want to restart your router when you get the confirmation email, which should come through tonight or tomorrow morning.

Customer: Awesome. And just to be clear, I'm locked in at the $119.99 for the first year, right?

Agent: That's correct. For the first 12 months, you'll be at $119.99. After that, it'll adjust to the regular rate of $139.99 unless there are any other promotions available at that time. We'll send you a notice before any rate changes happen.

Customer: Okay, good. Thanks for that. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: (pause) Not really. You're all set! You should see an email confirmation within a few hours, and then you'll be good to go. If you have any issues or if the speeds don't upgrade as expected, you can always call us back and we'll troubleshoot. But with the Fiber 500, I think you're going to be really happy.

Customer: Great, I appreciate it, Marcus. Thanks for your help.

Agent: My pleasure! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and enjoy those faster speeds. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!
