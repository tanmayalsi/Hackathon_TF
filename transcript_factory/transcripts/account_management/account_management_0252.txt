# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I'm thinking about upgrading my internet service. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 50 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine for a while, but my kids are doing remote school now, and my partner works from home, and like... it's just not fast enough. We're getting a lot of buffering and lag.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. Multiple people streaming and video conferencing at the same time can definitely max out that bandwidth. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you thinking something faster, or...?

Customer: I mean, I don't really know all the technical stuff. What would you recommend? Something that can handle all of us using it at once?

Agent: Great question. So for a household like yours, I'd definitely recommend stepping up to at least our Fiber 200 plan. That gives you 200 megabits per second, which is solid for multiple simultaneous connections. But if you want something even more robust, we offer Fiber 500, which would future-proof you for a few years.

Customer: What's the difference in price between those two?

Agent: (typing sounds) So the Fiber 200 is $79.99 a month, and the Fiber 500 is $109.99 a month. Now, we also have a promotional rate available right now if you sign a two-year agreement. That would bring the 200 plan down to $59.99 for the first year, then it goes to the regular price. And the 500 plan would be $79.99 for the first year.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) What happens after the first year? Does it jump up a lot?

Agent: Yes, so after year one, it would go to the standard rates I mentioned—$79.99 and $109.99 respectively. But honestly, a lot of customers find that it's still worth it because you're getting such a better experience. Plus, you can always call us back before the two years is up if you want to revisit your plan.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I think the Fiber 200 sounds like it would work. But I don't really want to lock in for two years. Can I just do month-to-month at the regular price?

Agent: Absolutely, you can. You'd be at $79.99 a month, no commitment. You can upgrade or downgrade whenever you need to.

Customer: Perfect. So how... how does this work? Do I need a new modem or anything?

Agent: (typing sounds) Good thinking. So the Fiber 200 plan uses a different modem than what you currently have. We can actually ship that out to you at no charge, and it usually arrives within three to five business days. We'll include setup instructions, but honestly, it's pretty straightforward—just unplug the old one and plug in the new one. The system recognizes it automatically.

Customer: Oh nice, that's easy. When would this take effect?

Agent: So I can process this upgrade for you right now. The new plan would be active as of tomorrow morning. You'll get a confirmation email here shortly with all the details, including your new modem tracking information.

Customer: Okay, yeah, let's do it. What else do I need to do?

Agent: (typing sounds) Nothing on your end right now. Let me just confirm a couple of details. Your service address is still 447 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: And the email on file is still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Alright, I'm processing this upgrade now. (more typing sounds) Okay, and it's all set! Your Fiber 200 plan is now active, effective tomorrow at 12:01 AM. Your monthly charge will be $79.99, and you should see that reflected on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Great. And I should expect the modem in the next three to five days?

Agent: Yes, exactly. You'll get a shipping notification within the next 24 hours, so keep an eye on your email. If you have any issues with the installation or if you need any technical support once it arrives, just give us a call back and we'll walk you through it.

Customer: Awesome. That's great. Thank you so much for your help.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. I really appreciate it.

Agent: Great! Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You should see a big difference in your speeds once that modem is installed. Have a wonderful day!

Customer: You too, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Take care. Bye now.
