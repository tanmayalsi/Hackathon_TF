Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm actually pretty happy with your service, but I'm thinking it might be time to upgrade. My internet's been feeling a little slow lately.

Agent: That's great to hear you've been with us! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Let me just pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's the same as my cell phone. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm seeing your account now. You're currently on our Fiber 100 plan—is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. I think I signed up for that when we first moved into the area.

Agent: Awesome. And just out of curiosity, what kinds of things are you doing online that's made you feel like you need more speed? Are you working from home, streaming, gaming, that sort of thing?

Customer: Oh, a bit of everything, honestly. I work from home two days a week doing video calls, and my wife streams a lot of Netflix. Plus our kids are doing online school stuff. It just seems like everything's buffering, you know? And it's getting annoying.

Agent: Yeah, I totally understand. You know, that actually sounds like a pretty heavy usage household. The good news is that we have some great options that would be perfect for your situation. So right now you're at 100 megabits per second. We can upgrade you to either our Fiber 300 plan or our Fiber Gig plan, which is our gigabit service—that's 1,000 megabits per second.

Customer: Wow, okay. So what's the difference in price? Because I don't want to break the bank here. (chuckles)

Agent: (chuckles) Totally fair question. Let me see what we can do for you. So your current plan is $59.99 a month, right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, so if you upgraded to the Fiber 300, that would be $79.99 a month. And then the Fiber Gig would be $99.99 a month. Now, I should mention that since you've been such a loyal customer for three years, I can actually apply a promotional rate for you. I can get you the Fiber 300 plan at $69.99 a month for the first twelve months, and then it goes to the regular rate after that.

Customer: Hmm, okay, that's not too bad. And what about the gigabit one? Is there any promotion on that?

Agent: Great question. For the Fiber Gig, I can do $89.99 for the first year, and then it's $99.99 after that. (pause) Given what you mentioned about the video calls, streaming, and the kids being online, honestly, the Gig plan might be your best bet. It'll give you plenty of headroom for everything happening at once.

Customer: That's tempting, but I think... I think I'll start with the 300. That seems like a good middle ground, and I don't want to overcommit, you know?

Agent: That makes total sense. The Fiber 300 is honestly a solid choice, and you can always upgrade down the road if you want to. (typing sounds) So I'm going to set you up with that Fiber 300 plan at the promotional rate. This upgrade won't require a technician visit since you already have our fiber infrastructure in place. It should go into effect within the next 24 hours, and your speeds should just automatically increase.

Customer: Oh really? That's nice. I don't have to do anything?

Agent: Nope, not a thing. Just keep your modem powered on, and the upgrade will roll through automatically. Your speeds should be noticeably better by tomorrow. You might want to restart your modem and router just to make sure everything's synced up properly, but honestly you don't even have to do that right away.

Customer: Okay, perfect. Um, is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Let me think... Oh, one thing—your promotional rate is locked in for twelve months, and then it'll adjust to the standard rate. You'll get a notification about thirty days before that happens so you're not surprised. And of course, if you have any issues with the speeds or anything else after the upgrade, just give us a call back and we can troubleshoot or explore other options.

Customer: Great, I appreciate that. And just to confirm, my bill stays the same for the next year at that $69.99?

Agent: Exactly right. $69.99 for twelve months, and then after that promotional period ends, it goes to $79.99. You'll get that heads-up thirty days before, like I said.

Customer: Awesome. I think that's everything I need to know. Thanks so much for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! I really appreciate your loyalty to Frontier, and I think you're going to see a big difference in your speeds. If you have any issues or questions moving forward, just don't hesitate to reach out. We're here 24/7. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again!

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier Communications. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye!

Agent: Bye now!
