# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, uh, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what name is the account under?

Customer: Jennifer Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right. I've had it for about two years now, and honestly, the speeds have been great, but my household is growing. My daughter just moved back in, and we've got, like, three streaming devices going at the same time, plus I work from home. It's just getting congested, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. Fiber 100 is solid for most uses, but when you've got multiple people streaming and working from home simultaneously, yeah, you definitely feel that limitation. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking for?

Customer: I'm not entirely sure what I need, to be honest. What do you have available?

Agent: Great question. So in your area, we have a few options. You could upgrade to our Fiber 300 plan, which would triple your speeds to 300 megabits per second. We also have Fiber 500 available, and at the top end, Fiber Gig gives you gigabit speeds—that's 1,000 megabits per second.

Customer: Wow, okay. That's... a lot of options. What's the price difference?

Agent: (typing) Okay, so let me give you the breakdown. Your current Fiber 100 is $79.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: The Fiber 300 would be $109.99 monthly. Fiber 500 is $139.99, and the Fiber Gig plan is $169.99 per month.

Customer: Hmm, and what's the difference between 300 and 500 in terms of... like, actual usage?

Agent: That's a smart question. Honestly, for most households, Fiber 300 handles multiple 4K streams, video calls, online gaming, and work-from-home stuff without any issues. Fiber 500 gives you even more headroom if you want that extra buffer, especially if you're uploading files or doing video conferencing regularly. The Fiber Gig is really if you want to future-proof yourself or you've got a lot of devices connected.

Customer: Okay, so for like... two people streaming Netflix, one person on Zoom calls, and someone maybe gaming occasionally, would 300 be enough?

Agent: Absolutely. Three hundred megabits is more than enough for that setup. You'd have plenty of bandwidth to spare. I'd say that's the sweet spot for your situation.

Customer: Alright, let's go with that then. The 300 plan.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to note that here. (pause, typing) So I can get you upgraded to the Fiber 300 plan. The good news is that since you're an existing customer in good standing, I can apply a promotional credit to your first three months. You'd get $20 off each month, so that brings it down to $89.99 for the first quarter, then it goes to the regular $109.99.

Customer: Oh nice, that's good. When would this take effect?

Agent: So the upgrade would be active as of tomorrow morning. You shouldn't experience any downtime with fiber, so it's pretty seamless. Your speeds just... step up automatically.

Customer: That's great. Do I need to do anything on my end? Change my modem or anything?

Agent: No, your current equipment should handle it fine. Your modem's already a Frontier-provided fiber modem, so you're all set there. You might want to restart it tomorrow just to make sure everything syncs properly, but that's optional.

Customer: Perfect. And just to confirm, it's just the internet that's changing, right? My TV and phone stay the same?

Agent: That's correct. Your internet plan is upgrading to Fiber 300. Your television service and phone line remain unchanged, so your bill will just increase by the difference on the internet portion. (pause) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: I don't think so... oh, actually, one more thing. How do I check my speeds once it's activated? Like, how do I know it's working?

Agent: Great question. You can go to speedtest.net or speedtest.frontier.com, and you can run a speed test from there. You should see speeds around 300 down and typically around 10 or 20 up with the Fiber 300 plan. I'm also going to send you an email confirmation of this upgrade with all the details, and there's a link in there to our Frontier app where you can monitor your speeds and connection anytime.

Customer: Awesome, that's really helpful.

Agent: You're welcome. So let me just recap everything for you. You're upgraded to Fiber 300 starting tomorrow, promotional rate of $89.99 for three months, then $109.99 after that. Your equipment stays the same, and no downtime expected. Sound good?

Customer: Sounds perfect. Thank you!

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. We really appreciate your business. If you have any issues with the upgrade or if you need anything else down the road, just give us a call back. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Great, I will. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too, bye!

Agent: Bye! (call ends)
