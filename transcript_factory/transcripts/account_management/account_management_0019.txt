# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your, uh, 300 megabit plan and I'm thinking about upgrading. My household has gotten a lot busier with streaming and working from home, and honestly, we're just not getting the speeds we need anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've definitely seen that trend. I'd be happy to help you explore upgrade options. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, just give me one second here... Got it. I'm seeing your account for... David Martinez at 847 Clearview Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And you're currently on the 300 Meg fiber plan?

Customer: Yes, exactly.

Agent: Awesome. So you've got great news—in your area, we actually have our gigabit fiber service available. That's ten times faster than what you're on now. We also have a 500 megabit tier in between if you want something... (pause) ...a little less of a jump.

Customer: Oh wow, gigabit? Like, one gigabit per second?

Agent: Yes, exactly. One thousand megabits per second. It's... (brief chuckle) ...it's pretty solid for households like yours. How many people are typically working or streaming at the same time?

Customer: Usually around... three, maybe four? My wife works from home, I'm remote now too, and then my two kids are homeschooled so they're doing online classes. We had some real lag issues last week during a video conference. It was pretty embarrassing, honestly.

Agent: Yeah, that would definitely cause problems with your bandwidth. You know, with gigabit, you could have all four of you streaming 4K video simultaneously and still have room to spare. But let me ask—are you looking to future-proof, or do you want something that fits your current needs?

Customer: I mean, I don't want to overpay for something I don't need, but I also don't want to upgrade again in six months, you know?

Agent: That makes total sense. Between you and me, the 500 meg tier is probably your sweet spot. It's a nice middle ground. Plus, the price difference isn't huge.

Customer: Okay, so what are we talking price-wise? What's the increase from my current plan?

Agent: (typing sounds) So your current plan is $79.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Sounds about right, yeah.

Agent: Alright. So the 500 meg plan would be $109.99, and the gigabit would be $129.99. And I should mention—we have a promotional rate for the first twelve months on both of those. For the 500 meg, you'd be looking at $99.99 for the first year, and gigabit would be $119.99.

Customer: Oh, okay. So that's like... thirty bucks more for a whole gigabit?

Agent: Yes, during the promotional period. After twelve months, it would go to the regular rate. But honestly, a lot of customers end up keeping the promo pricing anyway if they call back or stay as a loyal customer. It's not guaranteed, but I'm just being upfront with you.

Customer: I appreciate that. And this is fiber, so the speeds are guaranteed?

Agent: They are consistent, yes. Fiber is a lot more stable than cable. You won't see the same degradation during peak hours that you might with other services. Your speeds will be rock solid.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I think I want to go with the gigabit plan then. Future-proofing sounds like the way to go.

Agent: Excellent choice, David. I think you're going to be really happy with that. Let me just update your account here... (typing sounds) ...and I'll need to let you know that you'll need our newest modem for gigabit speeds. The one you have now can't handle it technically.

Customer: Oh, so there's a cost for that?

Agent: There is, but we actually include a modem with your plan. There's no additional equipment fee. We'll ship it to you free of charge, and it should arrive within three to five business days. You can set it up yourself, or if you want, we can schedule a technician to come do it. Most people find it pretty straightforward though.

Customer: Okay, I can probably handle it myself. When would the upgrade take effect?

Agent: (typing sounds) So I can make this effective immediately, or we can schedule it for a specific date if you'd prefer. Do you want to switch over today?

Customer: Yeah, let's do it today.

Agent: Perfect. So just to confirm everything—you're upgrading from the 300 meg fiber plan to our gigabit plan. Your new rate is $119.99 per month for the first twelve months, then $129.99 after. You'll be receiving a new modem, no equipment charges. Do you want the modem rushed, or standard shipping is fine?

Customer: Standard's fine. How long do I stay at the promotional rate exactly?

Agent: Twelve months from today. So you'll be at that rate through... (pause) ...June 2025. We'll send you a courtesy email about thirty days before it changes so you're not surprised.

Customer: Great, that's good to know. Um, and the modem—it just plugs in and works?

Agent: Basically, yes. You'll unbox it, plug in the power and the fiber connection, and your WiFi networks should pop up automatically. The WiFi password is on a sticker on the modem. Most people are online within ten minutes.

Customer: (chuckle) That's easier than I expected.

Agent: We tried to make it simple. And if you do run into any issues, you can always call us back. We've got twenty-four-seven support. I'm also going to email you a confirmation with all these details and a setup guide, okay?

Customer: Perfect. And my bill, that'll just update automatically?

Agent: Yes, your next billing cycle will reflect the new plan and the new rate. You'll see it on your statement. Oh, and one more thing—we're also running a promotion where you can add our premium security package for free for the first three months. It includes malware protection, password management, all that stuff. Want me to add that?

Customer: Um, maybe? What happens after three months?

Agent: It's $9.99 a month after the trial period. But you can cancel anytime, no penalty.

Customer: Sure, why not. Let's add it.

Agent: Awesome. I'm putting that on your account now. (typing sounds) All set. So we've got your gigabit upgrade with the promotional rate, free modem shipping, and the security package trial. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for walking me through it, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, David. I really appreciate your business with Frontier. You should be seeing some major improvements in your speeds once that modem arrives. If you need anything in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: I will. Thanks again.

Agent: Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
