Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, I've had your service for about three years now, and I'm pretty happy with it, but I'm starting to work from home more and I think I need something faster than what I've got.

Agent: Okay, great! I'm glad to hear you've had a good experience with us. Working from home definitely requires reliable speeds. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. And just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street in Portland?

Customer: Yes, that's the one.

Agent: Wonderful. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 200 plan, which gives you 200 megabits per second. What kind of speeds were you looking for?

Customer: Well, honestly, I'm not totally sure what I need. I mean, 200 sounds pretty fast to me, but my video calls keep buffering and sometimes when my roommate is streaming, everything gets really slow. We've got, like, four devices going at once pretty regularly.

Agent: Ah, yeah, that makes sense. So multiple users and video conferencing can definitely eat up bandwidth. Um... (pause) what kind of work are you doing, if you don't mind me asking?

Customer: I'm a graphic designer, so I'm uploading and downloading large files a lot. And like I said, my roommate streams Netflix basically constantly.

Agent: Okay, okay, that's really helpful context. So between your design work and your roommate's streaming, I'd actually recommend looking at our Fiber 500 plan. That's 500 megs down, which should give you plenty of headroom for everything you're doing.

Customer: Five hundred? Won't that be way more expensive?

Agent: (pause) Let me look at your current pricing. So you're at... looks like $79.99 a month for the Fiber 200. The Fiber 500 would be $109.99 a month, so that's about thirty dollars more.

Customer: Hmm, thirty bucks... (pause) What about the upload speeds? I upload a lot of files for work.

Agent: Great question. The Fiber 500 gives you 50 megabits per second on the upload side. Our Fiber 200 that you have now is 20 megs up. So that's a significant increase there—two and a half times faster.

Customer: Oh, okay, that actually does sound pretty useful. And I wouldn't need a new modem or anything, right? I don't want to deal with all that.

Agent: (typing sounds) You know, let me check what equipment you currently have... Okay, so you've got one of our newer modems from about two years ago, and that's actually compatible with the Fiber 500 speeds. So no equipment upgrade needed. You're all set there.

Customer: Oh nice! That makes it easy. So if I upgrade, when could it go into effect?

Agent: Excellent. So, I can process this upgrade for you right now, and typically it takes about... (pause) actually, since you're already on fiber and just upgrading speed, we can push that activation through pretty quickly. You're probably looking at 24 to 48 hours. We might even be able to get you set up tomorrow or the next day.

Customer: Tomorrow would be amazing, honestly.

Agent: I'll see what I can do. Let me get this set up for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm putting in the upgrade order for the Fiber 500 plan at $109.99 monthly. And just to confirm, you want to keep the same service address?

Customer: Yeah, same address is fine.

Agent: Perfect. And would you like your new rate to start on your next billing cycle, or do you want it to prorate and start immediately?

Customer: Um, what's the difference?

Agent: So if you start it immediately, we'd charge you a prorated amount for the remainder of your current billing cycle—so a few days at the new rate—and then your full $109.99 would kick in next month. If you wait until your next billing cycle, you just pay the current rate through the end of this month and then the new rate starts next month.

Customer: I think immediate is better, actually. I need the speed now anyway.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, I like the way you think. Okay, so I'm putting that as immediate activation. So you should see the upgrade go live within the next 24 to 48 hours. You'll get a confirmation email and a text message with the details.

Customer: Awesome. Is there anything I need to do on my end?

Agent: No, you shouldn't need to do anything. The speeds will just activate on their own once our backend systems push the update through. The modem you have will automatically handle it. Um, one thing I would mention though—just to be safe, if you restart your modem after the activation, that can sometimes help optimize the connection, but it's not required.

Customer: Okay, I can do that. Hey, one more question. Is there like a contract or anything?

Agent: (pause) So the Fiber 500 plan is month-to-month, no contract required. You can cancel anytime if you need to, though I'm hoping you'll love the speeds and stick with us.

Customer: (laughs) Yeah, I think I will. Alright, I think that's everything. Thank you so much.

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and welcome to Fiber 500! You should be all set. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye!

Agent: Bye!
