Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on like... I think it's the 100 meg plan? And I'm looking to upgrade because honestly, my internet's been slowing down lately, especially when my family's all home streaming and stuff.

Agent: I completely understand. That's actually pretty common, especially with more devices on the network. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Okay, got you here. So I'm seeing you're on our Gigabit 100 plan in the Scottsdale area, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. I've been with you guys for... three years now?

Agent: Great, and I appreciate your loyalty. So you're right that the 100 meg plan is good for lighter usage, but once you have multiple people streaming in 4K or doing video calls and gaming simultaneously, you definitely feel the limitations. What kind of activities are you guys doing at home that's causing the slowdown?

Customer: Well, my teenager's always on like TikTok and Discord with his friends, my wife works from home doing video conferences, and then I like to stream movies on the weekends. So yeah, it all adds up.

Agent: Absolutely. And that's exactly what our faster tiers are designed for. So we've got a few options for you. We have our Gigabit 200 plan at $79.99 a month, and then we also have our top-tier Gigabit 500 service at $109.99. Both would be... (pause) ...well, they'd be night and day compared to what you're experiencing now, honestly.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference between the 200 and the 500?

Agent: Good question. So the 200 gets you speeds up to 200 megabits per second, which would handle maybe four or five simultaneous high-quality streams without issues. The 500 is, like, our premium tier—500 megs per second—so it's really future-proofed. You could have eight, nine devices going at once, no problem.

Customer: That's... that's a pretty big jump from 100 to 500 though. Do I really need that?

Agent: (chuckles) Honest answer? Probably not. For your situation, I'd say the 200 meg plan would be perfect. It's a solid middle ground, and you'll notice an immediate difference. The 500's more if you're running like a small business from your home or if you have a ton of devices. It's overkill for most families.

Customer: Okay, so 200 seems good. What's the price again?

Agent: $79.99 per month for the first year, then it goes to $94.99 after that.

Customer: And that's just the internet, right? My bundle doesn't change?

Agent: (typing) Right, so you're on our internet-only plan. If you wanted to add TV or phone services, we could bundle that and actually save you some money, but if you're happy with just the internet, we can definitely do that. And the upgrade would take effect on your next billing cycle.

Customer: No, internet's all I need. But wait, $94.99 after the first year—is that something we could negotiate or...?

Agent: (pause) Well, what I can do is add a note to your account. You know, after about six months, if you call back in, our retention team can sometimes work with you on the pricing. But I can't lock anything in beyond that first year right now.

Customer: Hmm, okay. Um... and there's no installation fee or anything?

Agent: For an upgrade, since we already have service to your house, there's no installation fee. You should be able to just do a self-install, and we'd mail you a modem. It typically takes five to seven business days for the equipment to arrive.

Customer: Oh, can't you just swap it out sooner? I've been dealing with this for like a month.

Agent: (sympathetic tone) Yeah, I hear you. Let me see... (typing) Okay, so if you want expedited shipping, we can do overnight, but that would be an additional $29.99 fee.

Customer: (sighs) What if I just pick one up? Is there a local store?

Agent: Absolutely, yeah! That's actually the fastest option. We have a service center just off the 101 near Camelback Road. If you can get there this week, you could literally have it set up the same day.

Customer: Oh, that's perfect. I can do that.

Agent: Perfect. So just to confirm everything—you're upgrading from Gigabit 100 to Gigabit 200 at $79.99 a month, and you're going to pick up your modem at our retail location this week. [inaudible] I should mention, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Oh, wait—will I notice a big difference with my WiFi too, or do I need a new router?

Agent: That depends on your current router. If you have one of our newer units, you'll be fine, but if it's older, upgrading to a modern mesh WiFi system would really maximize those speeds. We have options, but that'd be separate from the modem.

Customer: I'll think about that. Let me just upgrade the internet first and see how it goes.

Agent: Good plan. Okay, so I've got everything set up on my end. Your new rate should show on your next bill. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's great. Thanks for your help, Marcus.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier! We really appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye!
