Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been with Frontier for about three years now, and I'm thinking I might want to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan is like... I think it's the 100 meg plan? And honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. Internet needs definitely change over time. Let me pull up your account real quick so I can see exactly what you're on right now. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Oh, yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service address at 2341 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: (pause) Great, I'm seeing your account here. You're absolutely right—you're on our Fiber 100 plan, so you're getting 100 megabits down. What kind of activities are you finding are slowing things down? Just so I can recommend the right plan for you.

Customer: Well, we've got like four people working from home now since, you know, everything's shifted. And my kids are always streaming stuff, and we've got... I dunno, a bunch of smart home stuff. It just feels like everything's buffering constantly during the day.

Agent: (nodding, though customer can't see) Yeah, that makes sense. Multiple video streams and remote work really do add up quickly. So with four people and that kind of usage, I'd probably recommend bumping you up to either our Fiber 300 plan or, if you want some headroom, the Fiber 500. Those would definitely handle that workload much better. Have you heard about those options?

Customer: No, not really. What's the difference in price? I mean, I don't want to break the bank here, but I also need it to actually work, you know?

Agent: Totally fair. (typing) So your current bill is $64.99 a month for the Fiber 100. If you upgrade to Fiber 300, that would be $79.99, so about fifteen bucks more a month. And then the Fiber 500 would be $94.99. Both come with no equipment fee since you already have our modem and router.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. And that's a locked-in rate?

Agent: Actually, that's a great question. The Fiber 300 is locked in at $79.99 for the first 12 months, then it goes to our standard rate of $89.99. The Fiber 500 is locked at $94.99 for 12 months, then $104.99 after. But honestly, you might find promotional pricing options available when your first year is up.

Customer: Okay, okay. So the 300 plan—that's 300 megs?

Agent: Exactly. 300 megabits download. You'll see a really noticeable difference from 100, especially with the multiple users you have on the network.

Customer: Yeah, I think that sounds better. I don't think I need the 500 necessarily. Let's go with the 300.

Agent: Perfect choice! (typing) Alright, so I'm going to process an upgrade for you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300. This will take effect on your next billing cycle, which would be... (pause) ...June 15th. You shouldn't need any new equipment or anything, so you're all set from a hardware perspective.

Customer: Great. Is there anything I need to do on my end? Like restart the modem or anything?

Agent: No, you're good. The system will update automatically on your service date. You might experience a brief connection drop—maybe like a minute or two—when that happens, but that's totally normal. If for some reason you don't see the speed improvement after a day or two, you can always give us back and we can troubleshoot, but I'm confident you'll see a big difference.

Customer: Awesome. And this is all set to go?

Agent: (typing) Yes, sir. I'm just going to send a confirmation email to the address on file—that's [inaudible]@gmail.com, right?

Customer: Uh, actually it's at yahoo. Y-A-H-O-O.

Agent: Oh, got it. Can you give me the full email address?

Customer: It's [email protected].

Agent: (typing) Perfect, I've updated that and I'm sending the confirmation now. You should receive that within a few minutes. It'll have all the details of your upgrade, the new rate, and the effective date.

Customer: Excellent. Hey, I appreciate your help, Derek. This should really solve our problem.

Agent: You're welcome! I'm really glad I could help. Just one more thing—I do want to mention we have a Fiber 500 plan available if your needs change down the road, and we also offer some bundle options with TV and phone if you're interested in exploring that. But for now, the 300 should be fantastic for your household.

Customer: Good to know. I think we're just good with internet for now, but I'll keep it in mind.

Agent: Sounds great. Thanks so much for being a Frontier customer for the past three years, and thank you for calling in today. If you need anything else, don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again!

Agent: Have a great day!
