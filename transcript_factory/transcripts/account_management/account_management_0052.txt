Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 meg plan, and honestly, I've been thinking about upgrading. My household is just... it's getting busier, you know? My kids are doing online school now, my wife's working from home, and I'm streaming a lot more stuff.

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually really common what we're seeing right now. So you're on the 500 meg plan currently?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. We've had it for... I want to say about two years now? And it was fine for a while, but lately things have been getting a little slow, especially when multiple people are using it at the same time.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, or the service address?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing) Perfect, I'm seeing that here. So Derek Smith on Maple Street, is that correct?

Customer: Wait, no—I'm the customer. You're Derek. I'm actually... (laughs) ...it's a little funny. I'm James. James Wilson.

Agent: (laughs) Oh my gosh, I apologize! That is funny. Okay James, so you're on the Gigabit 500 plan at $69.99 a month. And you're looking to upgrade. So we actually have a couple of options for you. We can move you up to our Gigabit 1 gig plan, or we have our Gigabit 2 gig plan if you really want to future-proof your setup.

Customer: What's the difference in pricing? Like, what would I be looking at?

Agent: Great question. So the Gig 1 plan is $89.99 a month, and that's basically double your current speeds—so 1 gigabit instead of 500 meg. And then the Gig 2 plan, which is our top tier, that's 2 gigs, and that's $129.99 a month.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) And what kind of difference would I actually see, though? Like, would it make a big difference if I go from 1 gig to 2 gig?

Agent: That's a fair question. Honestly, for most households, even with multiple people working from home and streaming, 1 gig is really plenty. The 2 gig plan is more if you're doing, like, heavy 4K video work, uploading large files constantly, or you've got a ton of smart home devices. But for typical household use? The 1 gig plan should handle everything really comfortably.

Customer: Okay, so probably the 1 gig would be good for us then. How long's that pricing locked in for? Is there a contract?

Agent: (typing) So here's the good news—we don't have long-term contracts. But I do have a promotion running right now. If you upgrade today, I can lock in $79.99 for the first year, and then it goes to the regular $89.99 after that. And there's no contract, so you can modify or cancel anytime.

Customer: Wait, really? So it's $79.99 the first year?

Agent: That's right. And that's actually our best promotion available right now.

Customer: That's not bad at all, actually. (pause) Can I ask—what would the installation process look like? Do I need to get a technician out here?

Agent: (typing) Okay, so let me check your setup here. (pause) Since you already have a Frontier fiber connection to your house, the upgrade should actually be pretty straightforward. In most cases, you just need a new modem and router that are compatible with the 1 gig speeds. We can ship those to you at no charge, and we have instructions for self-installation. But if you prefer, we can send a technician out for... looks like it'd be $99 for the installation service.

Customer: So you're saying I could just do it myself? With the new equipment you send?

Agent: Exactly. We have some pretty good video tutorials on our website too, and if you run into any issues, you can always call us. Most customers find it pretty simple—it's just replacing the modem and router.

Customer: I think I could handle that. I mean, I'm not super tech-savvy, but I've set up routers before. So if I go that route, I don't pay anything extra, right? Just the equipment?

Agent: Correct. The modem and router ship for free, and installation is free with the DIY option. You just pay the service fee starting next billing cycle.

Customer: Perfect. Okay, I think I'm ready to do this. Let's go with the 1 gig plan.

Agent: Awesome! (typing sounds) I'm just gonna process that upgrade for you right now. So to confirm, you're switching from Gigabit 500 to Gigabit 1 gig at $79.99 for the first year, then $89.99 after. You'll handle the self-installation, and we'll ship the modem and router within the next 2 to 3 business days.

Customer: That sounds good.

Agent: (pause) And I'm going to send a confirmation email to the address we have on file, which is [inaudible]—is that still jameswilson@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's still good.

Agent: Perfect. So you should see that equipment by next week. The email will also include a link to the installation guide. And just to make sure everything goes smoothly, we'll reach out about three days after you receive it to make sure you got everything set up okay. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds great. I appreciate it.

Agent: Of course! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. We really appreciate your business, and thanks for upgrading with Frontier. You're going to love those speeds. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
