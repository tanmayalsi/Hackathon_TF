# Frontier Communications - Internet Upgrade Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently subscribed to your 100 megabit plan, and I'm thinking about upgrading. My internet's been pretty slow lately, especially when my roommate's working from home.

Agent: I completely understand. That's actually something we hear pretty often, especially with more people remote working these days. Let me pull up your account really quick. Can I get your phone number or account number?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, awesome. And just to confirm, is this for the property at 2847 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm seeing here that you've been with us for about three years on that 100 Mbps fiber plan. That's great. So, what speeds were you looking at upgrading to? We have some really solid options available in your area.

Customer: Um, I'm not really sure what I'd need, to be honest. How much faster could I go?

Agent: (pause) Well, that's a great question. So in your area, we actually have our 500 Mbps plan available, and we also just rolled out gigabit service—that's 1 gig, or 1000 Mbps—in your neighborhood about six months ago.

Customer: Wow, okay. So what's the difference, like, practically speaking? Would I actually notice a difference between those two?

Agent: That's a really fair question. So, the 500 plan is fantastic if you have multiple people streaming, doing video calls, working from home simultaneously. That should easily handle two people. But if you're looking at future-proofing your setup, the gig service is... I mean, it's basically overkill for most homes right now, but it's there if you want it. It's really nice for faster downloads and uploads, especially if you're doing large file transfers.

Customer: Yeah, I think the 500 would probably be better for us. We don't really do anything crazy. So what's that gonna cost me?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so let me check current promotions. We actually have a really good deal running right now. The 500 Mbps plan is normally $89.99 a month, but with our current promotion, we can get you set up for $69.99 per month for the first twelve months. After that, it goes to the regular price.

Customer: Okay, so $69.99, and then it goes up?

Agent: Right, after the first year it would be $89.99. But you know, promotions change pretty regularly, so we can always look at options when that year is up. No surprises there.

Customer: That's not bad. How much am I paying now?

Agent: (pause, typing) You're currently at $79.99 per month for the 100 plan.

Customer: Oh, so it'd actually be cheaper for the first year?

Agent: Exactly, yeah. You'd save about ten dollars a month, and you're getting five times the speed. It's a pretty good deal.

Customer: Cool. And there's no installation fee or anything?

Agent: (pause) So, we do have a standard installation fee of $99 for the equipment upgrade, but with this promotion, we're actually waiving that for you.

Customer: Oh, really? Okay, that's awesome.

Agent: Yeah, it's a good time to upgrade. One thing I should mention—because you're going from 100 to 500, we will need to send a technician out to your home to upgrade your modem and potentially check the lines to make sure everything's optimized for the faster speeds. That usually takes about an hour, hour and a half.

Customer: Okay, that's fine. When could you get someone out there?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check availability. We have some openings this week. We have Thursday between 12 and 4 PM, or Friday morning between 8 AM and noon. What works better for you?

Customer: Thursday afternoon is better. Noon to 4, you said?

Agent: Yes, 12 to 4 PM on Thursday. Does that work?

Customer: Perfect. Yeah, that works.

Agent: Great. (pause) Okay, so I'm going to get you scheduled, and the technician will actually call you the day before to confirm. Is the best number to reach you 555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's fine.

Agent: Excellent. And just to recap everything for you—we're upgrading you from the 100 Mbps plan to our 500 Mbps plan at $69.99 per month for the first twelve months, waived installation fee, and we have a technician coming out this Thursday between noon and 4 PM. Does all of that sound correct?

Customer: Yes, that all sounds good.

Agent: Perfect. Your confirmation number is going to be F-4-7-9-2-8. We'll also send you an email and a text message with all these details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier Communications, and thank you for being a loyal customer. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
