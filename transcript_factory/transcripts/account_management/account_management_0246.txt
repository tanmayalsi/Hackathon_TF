Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now and I'm really happy with the service, but I'm thinking I need to upgrade. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: That's great to hear you've been happy with us! I'd be happy to help you explore upgrade options. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. Okay, so I'm seeing you're currently on our Gigabit 200 plan. What's prompting the upgrade? Are you finding speeds aren't fast enough, or is there something else?

Customer: Yeah, honestly the speeds have been fine for a while, but I work from home now and my family's streaming a lot more. We've got three people potentially working or taking classes at the same time, and 200 seems like it's starting to struggle, you know? I'm getting lag spikes during video calls.

Agent: I totally understand. With multiple devices going at once, that can definitely cause issues. (pause) So, we have a couple of great options for you. We offer our Gigabit 400 plan, or our top-tier Gigabit 1000 plan. The 400 is really solid for multiple devices and streaming, but if you want that extra headroom, the 1000 is where you really notice the difference.

Customer: What's the price difference between those two?

Agent: Great question. (typing sounds) So your current 200 plan is $89.99 a month. The Gigabit 400 would be $129.99 monthly, and our 1000 plan is $189.99. Now, I should mention that if you're willing to sign a two-year agreement, I can get you the 400 plan for $119.99 for the first year.

Customer: Hmm, a two-year agreement though... I'm not really sure about locking in like that.

Agent: That's totally fair. No pressure at all. A lot of customers like the flexibility of month-to-month. You can absolutely do that at the regular $129.99 price. And honestly, with what you're describing, I think the 400 would be perfect for your situation. You'd go from 200 to 400 down, so you're essentially doubling your speed.

Customer: That does sound pretty good. What about upload speeds? I do video calls pretty regularly for work.

Agent: Excellent point. (typing sounds) On the 200 plan you're currently getting about 10 megabits up. On the Gigabit 400, you'd get about 20 megabits up. And if you ever wanted to jump to the 1000, you'd get up to 35 megabits up. So definitely an improvement there.

Customer: Yeah, that would help. And how quickly can you get that installed? Or would it be a self-install?

Agent: Great question. For an upgrade from your current service, this would typically be a self-install, which means we can activate it within 24 to 48 hours. We'd send you a new modem and router... (pause) actually, let me check what you currently have. (typing sounds) You've got our standard equipment from about a year and a half ago. The new modem is actually going to be a significant upgrade—it supports Wi-Fi 6, which is going to give you better range and performance throughout your home.

Customer: Oh, that's nice. So I just swap it out myself?

Agent: Exactly. It's super simple. You'd just unplug your current modem, plug in the new one, and it'll automatically configure. We'll send you instructions, but it usually takes like five minutes. And we'd waive the $199 equipment fee for the upgrade, so you'd just start the new rate on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay, that sounds pretty straightforward. I think I want to do the 400 plan, month-to-month, at $129.99.

Agent: Perfect! You've made a great choice. (typing sounds) So just to confirm everything—we're upgrading you to Gigabit 400, month-to-month service at $129.99 per month. We're waiving the equipment fee, and I'm scheduling installation for... (pause) looks like we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and 6 PM for self-install. Is that window okay for you?

Customer: Yeah, tomorrow works. That's actually perfect.

Agent: Awesome. And I'm going to go ahead and add a courtesy courtesy technical support call to your account—just in case you have any questions when you're setting up the new equipment. We'll call you about 30 minutes after everything is activated to make sure everything's running smoothly.

Customer: Oh, that's really helpful. Thank you.

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely. Let me also confirm your email address so we can send you everything. I've got [inaudible] on file... is that still the best email?

Customer: Actually, could you update that? It's my first name, jake.morrison@email.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, jake.morrison@email.com. All set. Your new equipment should arrive by tomorrow evening. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much, Derek. I really appreciate it.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you for being such a loyal Frontier customer. We really appreciate your business. You'll see a huge difference with those speeds. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
