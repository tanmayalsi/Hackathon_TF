# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on the 300 megabit plan, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore. My kids are doing online school, I'm working from home, and we've got like three people video conferencing at the same time. It's been pretty rough.

Agent: I completely understand. That's actually a really common situation we're hearing about these days. Let me just pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's the number you called me from, actually. Well, the number I'm calling from. 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account here. I see you've been with us for about three years now, and you're on our Frontier Fiber 300 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So just to help me recommend the best option for you, can you tell me a little bit about your usage? You mentioned video conferencing—how many devices are typically online at the same time?

Customer: So like I said, three people are doing video calls pretty regularly. Plus we've got a couple of smart TVs, phones, tablets... I think we're just maxing out the bandwidth. Sometimes the video just freezes, or it takes forever to upload files to my company's cloud server.

Agent: Yeah, and those upload speeds would definitely be a factor on the 300 plan. (pause) So we have a couple of great options that could really help you out here. Our most popular upgrade would be our Fiber 500 plan. That's 500 megabits download and 100 megabits upload, which is a huge jump in upload speed—that's gonna solve those file transfer issues pretty much right away.

Customer: Okay, and what's the pricing on that?

Agent: So the Fiber 500 is currently $89.99 a month for the first year. After that, it goes to $109.99. That's a $30 increase from what you're paying now, I believe?

Customer: How much am I paying now?

Agent: (typing sounds) You're at $59.99 a month currently.

Customer: Wow, okay. So it'd go from sixty to ninety. That's... significant. Do you have anything in between, or is that the next step up?

Agent: That's actually our next tier, but I'll be honest with you—given what you've described, I really think the jump is worth it. The 500 plan is gonna give you the stability you need with multiple video conferences. However, we do also have a Fiber 400 plan that's $79.99 for the first year, then $99.99 after.

Customer: So that's the...?

Agent: That's 400 down, 75 up. It'd give you a nice middle ground. It's really between those two depending on your budget and how much you want to future-proof yourself.

Customer: (pause) Can I ask... is there any kind of promotion or loyalty discount you could offer me? I mean, I've been a customer for three years.

Agent: That's a great question. (typing sounds) Let me see what I can do here. (pause) Okay, so I do see that we have a current promotion where if you upgrade today, I can lock in the Fiber 500 at $84.99 a month for the first year instead of $89.99. And then after that first year, it stays at $109.99.

Customer: Really? Okay, so $85 for the first year?

Agent: Yes, $84.99. And just to sweeten the deal a little bit, I can also waive the $99 installation fee since you're an existing customer. So there's no truck roll charge.

Customer: Oh, that helps. Okay, yeah, I think the 500 plan makes sense. I'd rather have that extra security for the upload speeds.

Agent: Excellent choice. I think you're gonna be really happy with it. (typing sounds) So let me just get some information from you. Your service address is still 2847 Maple Street, apartment 3B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: And your phone number is still 555-0147?

Customer: Yep.

Agent: Great. So we can get you scheduled for installation. We have availability this Thursday between 8 AM and 6 PM, or... (pause) (typing sounds) ...next Tuesday between 10 AM and 2 PM. Which works better for your schedule?

Customer: Thursday would be perfect. Morning would be ideal.

Agent: Okay, how about Thursday between 8 AM and noon?

Customer: Perfect.

Agent: Wonderful. (typing sounds) Alright, so I've got you scheduled for this Thursday, December 19th, between 8 and noon for your fiber upgrade. A technician will come out and install the new equipment. The whole process usually takes about an hour. Do you have any questions about the installation?

Customer: Do I need to do anything to prepare? Like, do I need to be home, obviously, but... I don't know, unplug anything?

Agent: Good question. Yeah, just make sure someone's there to let the technician in. They might ask you to power down your current equipment while they're working, but they'll walk you through all of that. They'll also make sure everything's set up and working properly before they leave, so you'll be all set to go.

Customer: Okay, great. And just to confirm, the price is $84.99 a month for the first year?

Agent: That's right. $84.99 for the first year, and then $109.99 after that. No installation fee. And you'll keep all your same equipment except we'll swap out your modem for one that's compatible with the 500 plan speeds.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: (pause) I think that covers it. Oh, actually—you should receive a confirmation email shortly with all these details, including your installation appointment. If you have any questions between now and Thursday, you can always call us back.

Customer: Sounds good. Thank you so much, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. I really appreciate your business, and I think you're gonna love the upgrade. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thank you.

Agent: Great, well thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see you Thursday morning!

Customer: Sounds good. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
