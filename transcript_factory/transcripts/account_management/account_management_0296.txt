Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your, uh, 500 megabit plan, and I've been with you guys for about two years now. I'm thinking about upgrading to something faster because we've got more people working from home these days, and honestly, the internet's been feeling a little slow during peak hours.

Agent: I completely understand. That's actually pretty common, especially with multiple people on the network at once. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you right here. So you've been a great customer for two years—I see you're on the Fiber 500 plan. And you're experiencing some slowdowns during peak times?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. Like in the evenings when everyone's streaming or doing their video calls, it just gets... I don't know, it stutters sometimes. And my partner's been complaining about it too when she's on calls for work. We've got three of us working from here now, so...

Agent: Yeah, I hear you. Three people working from home simultaneously can definitely max out a 500 meg connection pretty quickly, especially if there's any streaming going on too. So here's what I'd recommend. We've got a couple of options for you. We have our Fiber 1-Gig plan, which would give you a gigabit of download and upload speeds, and then we also just rolled out our Fiber 2-Gig plan, which is... well, it's twice as fast as that.

Customer: (pause) What's the pricing like on those? And what would the installation cost be?

Agent: Great questions. So the Fiber 1-Gig plan is currently running $89.99 a month—that's actually $20 less than what you're paying right now for the 500 plan. And the 2-Gig plan is $129.99 a month. Now, since you're an existing customer, I can waive the installation fee for either of those upgrades. It would normally be $99, but I can take care of that for you.

Customer: Oh, really? That's... that's actually better than I expected. Wait, so the 1-Gig is cheaper than what I'm paying now?

Agent: Yes, sir. We just ran a promotion on that tier, and I'm able to lock you in at that rate. Plus, no installation fees. So you'd be saving money and getting substantially faster speeds.

Customer: Hmm, that does sound good. And you said there's a 2-Gig option too?

Agent: Mm-hmm. That's our premium tier. It's double the speed, so you'd be future-proofed for a while. It's $40 more a month than the 1-Gig, but honestly, for a household with three people working from home... it might be worth considering. No buffering, no stuttering, even if everyone's streaming in 4K at the same time.

Customer: (laughs) Well, I'm not sure we're doing 4K streaming, but... I don't know. Can I think about it?

Agent: Of course! Absolutely. I'd say if you want to start noticing an immediate improvement without breaking the bank, the 1-Gig at $89.99 is honestly hard to beat. You'll see a massive difference from your current setup. But if you want to go bigger, the 2-Gig is there.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I think let me start with the 1-Gig plan then. Can we get that set up?

Agent: Perfect choice. I think you're going to be really happy with that. So I'm gonna get you set up with the Fiber 1-Gig plan, waived installation fee, and I'll need to schedule a technician visit. How's your availability looking? Are you usually home on weekdays, weekends?

Customer: Weekends are better. I work from home during the week, but I'd rather not have someone here poking around while I'm trying to be productive, you know?

Agent: (typing sounds) I totally get that. Let me see what we have available for this coming weekend. (pause) Okay, so I've got Saturday the 18th between 8 AM and noon, or we've got a 2 to 6 PM window that same day. We also have Sunday the 19th if that works better for you.

Customer: Saturday afternoon—the 2 to 6 window—that should work fine.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) So I've got you scheduled for Saturday, August 18th, between 2 and 6 PM. The technician will come out, swap out your modem and router for the 1-Gig equipment, run any necessary line checks, and get you all set up. The whole thing should take about 45 minutes to an hour.

Customer: Great. And just to confirm, there's no installation fee, right?

Agent: That's correct. Zero installation fee. Your first bill with the new plan should reflect that. You'll see the rate of $89.99 starting on your next billing cycle. (pause) And I'm gonna add a note here... you're gonna receive an email with all the details of your appointment, including the technician's contact information in case you need to reschedule or anything.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Just make sure you have someone home who can accept the equipment. Other than that, you're all set. Do you have any other questions for me today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for being helpful, Derek. I really appreciate the discount too.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer. We really do appreciate your business. You're gonna love that extra speed—I promise. (laughs) Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: Nope, that's it!

Agent: Perfect. Well, thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and we'll see your technician on the 18th. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
