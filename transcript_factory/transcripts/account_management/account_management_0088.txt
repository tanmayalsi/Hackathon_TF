# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I currently have the 100 megabit plan, and I'm thinking I need something faster.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Got it. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. And honestly, the speed has been fine for a while, but my kids are doing remote school now, and we're all streaming and working from home, and it's just... it's getting slow during peak hours, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. That's something we hear a lot, especially with multiple people on the network at the same time. (pause) So we have a couple of great options for you. We offer Fiber 300 and Fiber 500, and we actually just launched Fiber Gig, which is our gigabit service. That's one thousand megabits per second. Which areas are you most interested in?

Customer: Wow, okay. Um, a thousand? That seems like a lot. I don't know if I need that much. What's the price difference between the 300 and the 500?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me get those prices for you. So our Fiber 300 is currently $79.99 per month, and the Fiber 500 is $99.99 per month. Both come with our standard equipment at no additional fee, and they're on the same network infrastructure you already have.

Customer: And what about the gigabit one?

Agent: The Fiber Gig plan is $129.99 per month. With that service, you get priority support and you're also eligible for a complimentary mesh Wi-Fi system upgrade, which is really valuable if you have a larger home.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm paying... what am I paying now for the 100?

Agent: You're currently at $59.99 per month for the Fiber 100.

Customer: Right. So if I go to the 300, it's only twenty bucks more. That actually doesn't seem too bad.

Agent: Right, exactly. And for your situation with the remote schooling and multiple devices, the 300 would give you roughly three times the speed, so you'd notice a significant difference during those peak hours. Plus, we're currently running a promotion where we'll waive the installation fee, which normally would be $99.

Customer: Oh, that's helpful. (pause) I think the 300 sounds good. When could you get that installed?

Agent: Let me check our availability. (typing sounds) (pause) We have availability next Tuesday or Wednesday. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Um, Tuesday would be better actually. What time?

Agent: We have morning windows between 8 AM and noon, or afternoon between 1 PM and 5 PM.

Customer: Morning would be great. 8 to noon is fine.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I've got you down for Tuesday morning. One of our technicians will come out and swap out your modem and router. The whole thing should take about an hour, hour and a half.

Customer: Okay, great. Um, do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure you're home, obviously. (chuckles) And if you have any other devices that are connected via Ethernet cable directly to the modem, we might need to reconnect those, but our tech can handle all of that. They'll make sure everything's working properly before they leave.

Customer: Sounds good. And this is just... I don't have to sign a contract or anything, right?

Agent: No, all of our plans are month-to-month, so you can upgrade or change whenever you'd like. There's no long-term commitment.

Customer: Nice. (pause) Okay, I think I'm good. Just to confirm, so I'm upgrading to the 300, the install is Tuesday morning, and you're waiving the installation fee?

Agent: That's correct. Your new rate will be $79.99 per month starting next billing cycle. (typing sounds) I'm sending a confirmation email to the address we have on file with all the details of your appointment. You should receive that in just a moment.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Nope, I think we're all set! One quick thing though—if you experience any issues with the service once it's installed, just give us a call back and we'll get it sorted out right away. We have 24/7 support.

Customer: Awesome. Thanks, Marcus, I really appreciate the help.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see you Tuesday morning.

Customer: Great, thanks. Have a good day.

Agent: You too! Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
