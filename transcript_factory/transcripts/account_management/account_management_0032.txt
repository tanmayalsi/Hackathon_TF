# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've had the same plan for like, three years now and I'm just... I feel like I need something faster.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I start by getting your account information? What's the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Oh sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I get the last name on the account?

Customer: It's Patterson. P-A-T-T-E-R-S-O-N.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm pulling that up now. (pause) Alright, I've got you here, Mr. Patterson. I see you're currently on our Frontier 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. A hundred megs or whatever.

Agent: Right, so you're getting 100 Mbps download speeds. What kind of activities are you finding that you need more speed for? Working from home, streaming, gaming...?

Customer: Oh, definitely streaming. My wife and I both like to watch stuff, and then my kids are always on YouTube or TikTok or... (laughs) I don't even know what else. And I've been trying to work from home two days a week, and it just feels slow when everyone's using it at the same time, you know?

Agent: Mm-hmm, I totally understand. That's pretty common. So with multiple users and streaming, you'd probably benefit from a faster tier. We currently have three options above your plan. We have the Frontier 300 at 300 Mbps, our Frontier Gig at one gigabit, which is 1,000 Mbps, and we also have the Frontier Gig Pro at 2 gigs if you really want to future-proof things.

Customer: Wow, okay. (pause) How much more are we talking? Like, what's the difference in price?

Agent: (typing sounds) So your current plan is $59.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. Maybe a little more with taxes and all that.

Agent: Right, yes. So the Frontier 300 would be $79.99 a month, the Gig would be $99.99, and the Gig Pro is $129.99. However, we do have a promotion running right now where if you upgrade to the Gig, we can get you that price locked in for twelve months at $89.99.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) And would I need new equipment or anything?

Agent: That's a great question. Since you're on the 100 plan, I would need to verify what modem you currently have. Do you happen to know the model?

Customer: Um... (pause) it's got a Frontier sticker on it. It's kind of rectangular and white?

Agent: (laughs) Okay, that narrows it down a little bit. Do you see any numbers or letters on the front of it?

Customer: Let me go look. (pause) Okay, I'm back. It says... FR-1000 or something like that?

Agent: Perfect, that's the FR-1200. That modem actually supports up to one gig speeds, so you wouldn't need to swap it out. You'd be good to go with the upgrade.

Customer: Oh nice! So I wouldn't have to pay anything extra for equipment?

Agent: That's correct. No equipment fees. We'd just need to push a configuration change to your modem remotely, and you'd be all set. The speed increase should take effect within 24 hours.

Customer: That sounds... that actually sounds pretty good. Can I ask, is there anything else? Like, any hidden fees or anything?

Agent: That's a smart question. (pause) The pricing I quoted includes everything except taxes and any applicable fees for your area. There are no installation fees since you have existing equipment. The only thing I want to be transparent about is that this promotional price of $89.99 is locked in for the first twelve months. After that, it would go to the regular Gig pricing, which is $99.99. But of course, you can always call back closer to that time if you want to explore other options.

Customer: Okay, that's fair. Yeah, I think I want to do it. What about the contract? Do I have to sign up for a long-term thing?

Agent: Nope. Frontier is month-to-month. You can cancel or change your service anytime without any early termination fees or penalties.

Customer: Great! Yeah, let's go ahead and do it then.

Agent: Excellent! Let me just confirm the details with you. I'm upgrading your account from Frontier 100 at $59.99 to Frontier Gig at $89.99 per month for the first twelve months. The promotional pricing applies for one year, and after that it goes to $99.99. Your existing modem is compatible, no equipment charges, and we'll push the configuration remotely. Does all of that sound correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. Okay, I'm processing that upgrade now. (pause) And... all set! Your upgrade is confirmed. You should see a confirmation email within the next few minutes. The speed boost can take up to 24 hours to activate, but usually it's much faster than that. You might see it within an hour or two.

Customer: Oh great! And if there's an issue, I just call back?

Agent: Exactly. If you don't see the speed increase within 24 hours, or if you notice anything else, just give us a call back and we can help troubleshoot. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks so much, Marcus. You were really helpful.

Agent: My pleasure, Mr. Patterson! I'm glad I could help. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and enjoy that faster internet!

Customer: Thanks!

Agent: Have a great day.
