Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Marcus. So, I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm pretty happy with your service, but I'm wondering if I can upgrade my internet speed. My current plan isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm seeing here that you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. One hundred megs down, right?

Agent: That's right. So what's prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, streaming... what kind of usage are you looking at?

Customer: Well, my wife and I are both remote now—we both work from home—and we've got, like, three or four devices going at any given time. Plus, our son's always gaming and doing schoolwork online. It's just... we're getting a lot of lag and buffering, especially when multiple people are trying to use it.

Agent: Oh yeah, that makes total sense. A hundred megs can definitely get stretched thin with multiple heavy users. The good news is, you're in a Fiber service area, so we've got some really solid options for you. (pause) What speeds are you thinking? Are you looking to jump up to 300, or go all the way to our gig service?

Customer: Um... I'm not sure. What would you recommend?

Agent: Well, for your situation with multiple remote workers and a gamer in the house, I'd probably suggest our Frontier Fiber 300 plan. That gives you 300 megs down, and it's usually plenty for everything you just described. The gig plan is amazing if you want future-proofing, but honestly, for most households, 300 is the sweet spot. It's also more economical.

Customer: Okay, what's the price difference?

Agent: Great question. (typing sounds) So your current plan is $49.99 a month for the first year, then it goes to $69.99 after that. The Fiber 300 plan would be $69.99 for the first twelve months, then $89.99 after the promotional period. And then our gig service is $99.99 for year one, $119.99 after.

Customer: (pause) Wow, okay. And that's just for internet, right? No bundling?

Agent: That's correct—that's just the internet service. However, if you're interested, we do have some bundle packages that could actually save you money if you wanted to add TV or phone service. Are you currently using those with us?

Customer: No, we're good on TV. We've got Netflix and all that. And we use our cell phones for calls mostly.

Agent: I totally get it. So if you want to stick with just internet, I'd definitely recommend the Fiber 300. You'll see a huge improvement immediately, and it'll handle everything you're throwing at it. The upgrade process is super simple—we can ship out a new gateway modem to you, probably get it there within five to seven business days, and you can self-install. Takes about ten minutes.

Customer: Do I have to send back the old modem?

Agent: Yes, we'll include a prepaid shipping label in the box, so you just box up the old one and drop it off. No hassle. (pause) So are you thinking you want to go with the Fiber 300?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. How soon can we make that happen?

Agent: Perfect. Let me get this set up for you. (typing sounds) So I'm going to process this upgrade. This will take effect on your next billing cycle, which looks like... the 15th of next month. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Awesome. And just to confirm, the modem will ship to the same address on file—that's 2847 Riverside Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: (typing sounds) Excellent. So just to recap what we've got here—you're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, effective on your next billing cycle. Your promotional rate of $69.99 per month will apply for the first twelve months, and you'll receive a new modem to self-install. You should see a shipping notification within a couple of days with tracking info.

Customer: Great. And I'll get the shipping label to send the old one back?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. It'll all be in the box. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for walking me through this, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer. We really appreciate it. You should start seeing those improvements right away once you get the new modem installed. If you have any issues or questions during the setup, just give us a call back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
