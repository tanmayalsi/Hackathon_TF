# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet service. I've had the same plan for like three years now and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. We've actually upgraded our network quite a bit in the past couple years, so you've got some great options. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the best name on the account?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, David. I'm seeing here you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. A hundred megs. It was fine when I first got it, but now I'm working from home a lot more, and my wife streams, and our kids are doing school online. It's just... we're always hitting the limit or getting slow speeds.

Agent: Yeah, that makes complete sense. With multiple users on the network doing bandwidth-heavy activities, a hundred megs can definitely get overwhelmed. The good news is you're in one of our upgraded fiber corridors, so we've got some really solid options for you. What kind of speeds are you looking to get?

Customer: Um... I'm not really sure? Like, what would you recommend? I don't want to overpay if I don't need it, but I also don't want to upgrade and then have the same problem in six months, you know?

Agent: That's a smart way to think about it. So with three to four people actively using the internet, streaming and video conferencing, I'd honestly recommend our Fiber 300 or Fiber 500 plan. The 300 would give you plenty of headroom for what you're describing—that's three hundred megabits per second—and it's a really popular sweet spot. The 500 is there if you want even more future-proofing.

Customer: What's the price difference?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so your current Fiber 100 is $79.99 a month. The Fiber 300 would be $109.99 a month, and the Fiber 500 is $129.99. But since you've been with us for three years, I can actually apply a promotional rate. Let me see what I can do here...

Customer: Oh, that's good. I appreciate that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, so I'm showing a current promotion where if you upgrade to Fiber 300, I can lock you in at $99.99 for the first twelve months. After that it would go to the regular rate, but you'd at least get a year at a discount.

Customer: That's not bad. So that's like thirty bucks more a month than what I'm paying now?

Agent: Right, thirty bucks more during the promotional period. And honestly, going from one hundred to three hundred megs, you're getting triple the speed for that price increase. Seems like a solid value.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I think Fiber 300 sounds good. How soon can that happen?

Agent: Great choice. So I can actually process this upgrade right now and get the change made to your account. The new speeds should be available within the next 24 to 48 hours. You shouldn't need a technician to come out since you already have the fiber connection installed. Your modem might need to be swapped out though. Are you using the Frontier-provided equipment?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. It's that white box thing that's been sitting in my closet... I mean, it's in the cabinet under the TV.

Agent: (chuckles) Perfect. Okay, so I'll have a new modem shipped out to you. It should arrive in about three to five business days. Once you get it, it's really simple—just unplug the old one, plug in the new one, and you're all set. I can email you instructions too if you want.

Customer: Is there anything I need to do before that arrives? Like will my internet still work?

Agent: Absolutely, you'll have internet the whole time. The old modem will keep working until you swap it out. Once you plug in the new modem, it'll automatically detect the faster speeds and optimize everything. The transition usually takes about five to ten minutes.

Customer: Nice. Okay, and what about the installation fee or anything like that? Any hidden charges?

Agent: Nope, no installation fee since we're not sending a technician. The modem is free, and the new modem you return can be done through the prepaid label we'll include in the box, or you can take it to one of our retail locations. Your bill will just reflect the new plan price starting with your next billing cycle. No surprises.

Customer: That's great. Yeah, I'm happy with that.

Agent: Awesome. Let me just confirm everything here. I'm upgrading your service from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, effective immediately. Your promotional rate is $99.99 per month for the first twelve months. A new modem will be shipped to this address—is 42 Oakridge Drive still correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And we'll send you an email confirmation of all these changes, plus the tracking information for the modem once it ships out tomorrow. Is the email address on file still [inaudible]@yahoo.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's still good.

Agent: Great. You should see everything reflected in your account within the next couple hours, and you'll get that confirmation email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Oh, actually—one question. Will there be any downtime when I switch the modem?

Agent: Good question. When you unplug the old modem and plug in the new one, you might lose internet for about five to ten minutes while the new one boots up and connects to our network. Just a heads up so you're not caught off guard.

Customer: Okay, good to know. I'll do it at like midnight or something when everyone's asleep.

Agent: (laughs) That's smart thinking. Alright, David, thank you so much for being a Frontier customer for the past three years, and thanks for upgrading with us today. We really appreciate your business. You should have those faster speeds up and running by this time tomorrow at the latest.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks Marcus, I appreciate your help.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
