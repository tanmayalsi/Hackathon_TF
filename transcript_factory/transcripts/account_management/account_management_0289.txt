Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. So I'm currently on the 500 meg plan, and I'm thinking about upgrading to something faster. My roommate just got fiber installed at his place and he won't stop bragging about his speeds, so... (laughs) I figured I'd check what you guys have available.

Agent: (chuckles) I totally get that. Well, you're in luck because you're already in one of our fiber service areas. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 541-area code, 238-4756.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're on our Gig Fiber 500 plan right now, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Nice. And just out of curiosity, what's prompting the upgrade? Are you experiencing any slowdowns, or is it more for future-proofing?

Customer: Honestly, it's a little bit of both. I've been working from home more lately, and I've got like three devices streaming at once pretty regularly. The 500 megs does fine most of the time, but I've noticed some lag when everyone's using the internet. Plus, like I said, my roommate keeps telling me how fast his connection is.

Agent: (laughs) Fair enough. That's actually a really common scenario, especially with multiple devices. So we have a couple of options for you. We have our Gig Fiber 1 gigabit plan—that's double what you're getting now—and then we also have our Gig Fiber 2 gigabit plan if you really want to future-proof things. Which one sounds more appealing to you?

Customer: What's the price difference there? I don't want to go crazy with my bill.

Agent: Great question. So your current plan is $79.99 a month with your promotional rate. The Gig Fiber 1 gig plan is $89.99 for the first 12 months, then it goes to $109.99 after that. And the 2 gig plan is $129.99 for the first year, then $149.99 after the promo period.

Customer: Okay... and that includes the modem and everything?

Agent: Good question. So the modem is included with service, but there's a $10.99 monthly equipment fee. That applies to all our plans. However, if you upgrade today, I can actually waive that fee for you for the first six months as part of our upgrade promotion.

Customer: Oh, that's cool. So that would save me like... (pause) sixty bucks over six months?

Agent: Exactly, yeah. And just to be clear, you're already set up for fiber in your location, so there wouldn't be any installation fees. We'd just need to swap out your current modem for a newer one that can handle the gigabit speeds. That's a pretty simple process—we can either mail it to you or you can pick one up at a Frontier location if you prefer.

Customer: Mailing it would be easier for me. How long does that usually take?

Agent: (typing sounds) Typically three to five business days depending on your zip code. We'd send you the new modem, and then it's literally just plug-and-play. You shut down the old one, connect the new one, and you're good to go. If you have any issues, we can walk you through it or you can call back.

Customer: That sounds pretty straightforward. Um, what if I go with the 2 gig? Do I need a different modem for that?

Agent: That's a great question. We do have a different modem for the 2 gig plan that's optimized for those speeds, but honestly, if you're not super tech-savvy or you just don't think you'll need it, the 1 gig plan is going to handle multiple devices and streaming really well. Most customers find that's more than enough.

Customer: Yeah, I mean... I don't think I need 2 gigs. That seems like overkill. Let's go with the 1 gig plan.

Agent: Perfect choice. (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm setting you up for the Gig Fiber 1 gigabit plan at $89.99 a month with the equipment fee waived for six months. The new modem will be shipped to your address on file at 847 Maple Street, apartment... (pause, typing) ...4B. Is that still correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's still good.

Agent: Great. And what email should I send the shipping confirmation to?

Customer: It's jason.m.rivera—that's R-I-V-E-R-A—@gmail.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. And just to set expectations here, your new speeds should be active within 24 hours after you set up the modem. You might notice your bill will adjust on your next billing cycle, which looks like it's on the 15th of next month. So you'll see the prorated charges reflected then.

Customer: Okay, and this promo rate—the 89.99—that's locked in for a year?

Agent: Yes, sir. Twelve months. After that it'll adjust to the regular rate of 109.99 unless you have another promotion available at that time. We usually run promotions pretty regularly for loyal customers, so there's a good chance you'll have something available then.

Customer: Nice, alright. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: (pause) Just a couple things. Make sure when you get the modem to keep the old one for at least a week or so in case you need to troubleshoot anything. And we'll throw in a prepaid return shipping label so you can send the old one back whenever. Also, if you download our Frontier app, you can check your connection speeds and monitor your usage from there, which is pretty handy.

Customer: Cool, I'll definitely do that.

Agent: Awesome. So I've got this all set up for you, Jason. You should see an email confirmation within a couple hours, and then your modem will arrive in three to five business days. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks, Derek, I appreciate it.

Agent: You bet! Thanks for calling Frontier, and thanks for sticking with us. You're gonna love those gig speeds. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too!

Agent: Bye now.
