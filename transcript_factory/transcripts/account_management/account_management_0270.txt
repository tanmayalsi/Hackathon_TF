Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. I've got the 100 meg plan right now and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. We've got some great options available. Before we dive in, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now... And can I also get the name on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're on our 100 meg fiber plan, and you've been with us for about three years now. That's awesome. What kind of speeds are you looking at? What's making you feel like you need more bandwidth?

Customer: Well, I've been working from home a lot more lately, and my wife streams during the day. Plus we've got two kids who are always doing online school stuff. So we're just maxing out constantly. Like, Zoom calls keep dropping and...

Agent: (interrupting gently) Yeah, yeah, that makes total sense. Multiple users on video conferencing is definitely a bandwidth hog. So what we'd typically recommend in your situation would be either our 300 meg or our 500 meg fiber plan. Both are available in your area. Have you thought about which direction you'd like to go?

Customer: Um... I'm not really sure what the difference would be for us. Would 300 be enough, or should I just go bigger?

Agent: That's a good question. For what you're describing—working from home, streaming, online schooling—I'd honestly recommend the 300 meg. That should give you plenty of headroom without paying more than you need to. The 500 meg is more for people running small businesses or... you know, serious gamers, that kind of thing. (pause) But if you think there's a chance you might need more down the road, the 500 is there.

Customer: No, no, 300 sounds like it would be fine. What's the pricing on that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so for new speed upgrades, we've actually got a promotion running right now. The 300 meg plan is $79.99 a month for the first twelve months, and then it goes to $99.99. Your current plan is at $59.99, right?

Customer: Oh wow, so it's gonna go up pretty significantly after the year?

Agent: Yeah, it does bump up, but you're getting triple the speed, so... (pause) And honestly, after that promotional period, you might want to give us a call and see if there's anything else we can do for you. We usually have options available.

Customer: Okay, that... that seems reasonable, I guess. Will I have to do anything on my end? Like, do I need a new router or anything?

Agent: Great question. Your current modem should be compatible with the 300 meg speeds, but we can actually send you an upgraded modem if you'd like. It's a newer model and it'll optimize your connection a bit better. There's no charge for the equipment.

Customer: Oh, that'd be nice. Yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) So I'm gonna get that shipped out to you. It should arrive within five to seven business days. When it comes in, you'll just unplug the old one and plug in the new one—it's literally just swapping it out. Takes about thirty seconds.

Customer: That easy, huh? [inaudible] ...sorry, go ahead.

Agent: (pause) No worries. Um, so the upgrade itself should take effect... (typing sounds) ...looks like tomorrow morning. You might experience a brief service interruption, maybe five or ten minutes around 2 AM, just for the line activation. That usually happens in the middle of the night though.

Customer: Oh, okay, that's fine. I won't even notice that.

Agent: Excellent. So just to confirm everything—I'm upgrading your service to 300 meg fiber at $79.99 monthly for twelve months, and we're sending you a new modem at no charge. Your new speeds should be active tomorrow. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds great. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: (pause) Let's see... no, I think we're all set. Oh, actually—once you get the new modem and have it set up, if you run into any issues, just give us a call back and we can walk you through it. But honestly, most people get it up and running without a hitch.

Customer: Okay, great. Thanks so much for your help, Derek.

Agent: My pleasure, Michael! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and I really appreciate you upgrading with us. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. I'm good.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thanks again, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now! (click)
