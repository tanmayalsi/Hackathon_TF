# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! I can definitely look into upgrade options for you. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Okay, and just to verify, is this for the service at... 427 Maple Street in Portland?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect, got it. So you mentioned your current plan isn't meeting your needs. Can you tell me a little bit about what you're looking for? Are you having speed issues, or...?

Customer: Yeah, mostly speed. I've got the 100 meg plan right now, and honestly, with working from home and my kids doing online school, we're constantly buffering. My partner's on video calls all day, and it's just... it's frustrating, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. That's actually pretty common with families now. (pause) Okay, so looking at your account here, you've been with us for about three years now, which is great. And I see you're on our Fiber 100 plan at $64.99 a month. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. It might've gone up a bit though, I'm not totally sure.

Agent: I can check on that for you. (typing sounds) Looks like it's actually at $69.99 currently. We did have a rate adjustment about six months ago. But anyway, the good news is we have some excellent upgrade options available to you. We offer Fiber 300 and Fiber 500 at this location.

Customer: What's the pricing on those?

Agent: Great question. So the Fiber 300 plan, which gives you 300 megabits per second, would be $89.99 per month for the first year, and then it goes to $99.99. And our Fiber 500 plan is $119.99 for the first year, then $129.99 after that.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, that's... that's quite a jump from what I'm paying now.

Agent: I hear you. But I want to point out that with the Fiber 300, you'd be tripling your speed, which should really help with those buffering issues you mentioned. And honestly, for a household with multiple people using the internet simultaneously, I'd definitely recommend at least the 300. The 500 is great if you want some extra headroom for the future.

Customer: Right, yeah, okay. What's included? Like, is there any promotional pricing or anything?

Agent: (typing) Let me see what we have available for you... (pause) Okay, so because you're a loyal customer with a clean account, I can actually offer you the Fiber 300 at $84.99 for the first twelve months instead of the $89.99. That's a $60 annual savings right there.

Customer: Oh, okay, that's better. And then it jumps to the $99.99 after that?

Agent: Correct, yes. After the first year, it would be $99.99 per month. And your current router should actually be compatible with the higher speeds, but we can upgrade your equipment if you'd like—that's included at no extra charge.

Customer: I think I'm still a little on the fence. Can I ask—do I have a contract or anything right now?

Agent: (typing) Let me check that for you. (pause) No, you're month-to-month, which is good. You can cancel anytime without any penalties. And actually, if you want to try the upgrade risk-free, we can set you up with a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you're not happy with the service for any reason, you can switch back to your current plan with no questions asked.

Customer: Oh, that's actually really helpful. That does make me feel better about it.

Agent: Absolutely. That's why we offer it. (pause) So would you like to go ahead with the upgrade to Fiber 300?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. How quickly can that be installed?

Agent: (typing) Let me check our availability... (pause) Looks like we have appointments available tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 5 PM, or we have Wednesday morning between 10 AM and noon. What works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be perfect. Can I do like 3 o'clock?

Agent: (typing) Let me confirm that... (brief hold sound) Okay, I've got you scheduled for tomorrow at 3 PM. The technician will come out and make sure everything is properly installed. The whole process usually takes about an hour. You'll also get a confirmation text message within the next few minutes.

Customer: Great. Is there anything else I need to do, or...?

Agent: Nope, you're all set! Your new plan becomes active tomorrow at 3 PM. Just to recap, you're upgrading to Fiber 300 at $84.99 per month for the first year. We'll waive the $99 installation fee since you're an existing customer, so that's another savings for you. And remember, you've got that 30-day satisfaction guarantee if you want to change your mind.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks so much, Marcus. I really appreciate it.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. If you have any questions before tomorrow, feel free to give us a call back. Otherwise, we'll see you tomorrow at 3 PM!

Customer: Sounds good. Have a great day!

Agent: You too! Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. (call ends)
