Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm currently a customer and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet plan. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Awesome, I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm seeing you're on our Fiber 100 plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've had it for... I want to say two years now? And honestly, it was great at first, but we're working from home more, and my partner's been streaming a lot, and it just feels slow now.

Agent: I totally get that. A hundred megabits is solid for basic browsing, but if you've got multiple people doing bandwidth-heavy activities, that can definitely cause some slowdowns. (pause) Let me ask you a few questions so I can recommend the best fit. How many people are typically online at your place?

Customer: Usually two, sometimes three when my son's home from college. And he games, so... (laughs) that doesn't help.

Agent: (laughs) Yeah, online gaming and streaming definitely add up fast. Okay, so we've actually got some great options for you. Your address is eligible for our Fiber 300 or Fiber 500 plans. The 300 is triple your current speed at 300 megabits down, and the 500 is, well, 500 megabits. Most of my customers with gaming and streaming find that the 300 handles everything really smoothly.

Customer: Okay, so what's the price difference? I mean, I don't want to go crazy, but I also don't want to deal with this lagging anymore.

Agent: (typing sounds) So you're currently paying $59.99 a month for the Fiber 100, correct?

Customer: Yeah, around there, I think.

Agent: Great. So I can get you set up on the Fiber 300 for $74.99 a month. That's only about fifteen bucks more, and you'd be getting three times the speed. If you wanted to go up to the 500, that would be $89.99. We also have a promotion running right now where if you commit to a two-year term, we can lock in those prices and waive the installation fee—that usually runs $99.

Customer: (pause) So no installation fee if I sign a two-year contract?

Agent: That's correct. You'd also get our first month half off as part of the promotion.

Customer: Hmm. What if I don't want to do the two-year thing? Can I just upgrade without it?

Agent: Absolutely, you can. Month-to-month is always available. Without the contract, the installation fee would apply, but you'd have more flexibility if your needs change. The monthly rate would be the same though—$74.99 for the 300.

Customer: Okay... I think I'd rather do the two-year contract then. The $99 fee is kind of a lot. And I mean, we're probably gonna stay here, so it's not a big deal.

Agent: Perfect choice. (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm gonna go ahead and set you up for the Fiber 300 with a two-year commitment. The installation appointment... let me see what we have available. We've got next Tuesday between 2 and 4 PM, or Thursday morning between 9 and 11 AM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Tuesday works. That's... what, the 18th? Let me just make sure I'm here... yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Awesome. I've got you down for Tuesday, the 18th, between 2 and 4 PM. One of our technicians will come out, they'll assess your setup and get you connected to the new fiber line. You should have service upgraded that same day, usually within that window.

Customer: Great. And I should just keep using the same router and everything?

Agent: Good question. So your current router might be compatible, but it honestly depends on the model. The technician will check when they come out. If it's not compatible with our higher speeds, we can swap it out for free. Our newer router is WiFi 6, so you'll actually get better coverage and speeds than your current one anyway.

Customer: Oh nice, that's helpful. (pause) Anything else I need to do before the appointment?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. I'm gonna send you a confirmation email with all the details—your appointment window, what to expect, and your new billing information. Just make sure someone's home during that Tuesday window. Um, one more thing—is there anything else I can help you with today? Do you have our home phone service or...?

Customer: No, just the internet. Actually, wait—am I getting a bill credit or anything for the first month being half off? How does that work?

Agent: Great question. So the half-off promotion will show up on your next bill. You'll see a credit applied, so you'll only be charged half the $74.99 for this first month. Then the regular rate kicks in after that. It's automatic, so you don't have to do anything.

Customer: Perfect. Okay, I think I'm good. When does the new plan take effect?

Agent: Once the technician completes the installation on the 18th, you'll be switched over and ready to go. If for some reason there's a delay, we'd follow up with you, but typically everything's up and running that day.

Customer: Awesome. Thank you, this was really helpful.

Agent: (warmly) You're very welcome! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and thanks for upgrading with us. You're gonna notice a huge difference with that 300 plan, especially with the gaming going on. If you have any issues or questions before Tuesday, just give us a call back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again, Marcus.

Agent: Have a great day!
