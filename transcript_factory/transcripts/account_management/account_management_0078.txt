Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan, and honestly, I'm thinking about upgrading. My work from home situation has changed and I need something faster.

Agent: Okay, great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me just pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, or your account number?

Customer: Sure, it's area code 503, then 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're on our 500 meg plan currently, and you're looking to upgrade. What kind of speeds are you thinking about?

Customer: Well, I'm not totally sure what I need, to be honest. I'm doing a lot of video conferencing now, uploading files, that kind of stuff. My roommate also streams a lot, so... yeah, I think I need more bandwidth.

Agent: Absolutely, that makes sense. So for video conferencing and file uploads, you'd probably be good with our gigabit tier—that's 1 gig down, 500 meg up. That's significantly faster than what you have now, and it handles multiple streams really well.

Customer: Okay, so that's... how much more is that per month?

Agent: (pause) Let me see here. You're currently at... $79.99 for the 500 meg. Our gigabit plan would be $99.99 per month for the first year, and then it goes to $119.99 after that.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) And how soon could that be installed? I'm kind of hoping to get this going pretty quickly.

Agent: Well, the good news is you're already a customer, so we wouldn't need a new installation. It's just a modem upgrade. We could potentially get that out to you by... (typing sounds) looks like we have availability for a technician visit next Tuesday or Wednesday. Would either of those work for you?

Customer: Tuesday works. What time are we talking?

Agent: We have a window from 9 AM to 1 PM available on Tuesday. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect.

Agent: Excellent. And just to confirm, we'll be upgrading you to the gigabit plan at $99.99 for the first twelve months. After that, the rate will be $119.99 unless you have other promotions running. We'll also need to swap out your modem for one that supports the gigabit speeds. There's no equipment fee for that.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: (pause) Not really, just make sure someone's home on Tuesday for the tech. It usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes, and they'll test everything to make sure you're getting those speeds. You should see a pretty big difference right away.

Customer: Great. And the service will... what's the word... it won't interrupt my internet during the upgrade, right?

Agent: There will be a brief interruption when they swap the modem—maybe five or ten minutes—but that's it. They'll get you back online and test it out. You'll be all set.

Customer: Perfect. So I should be expecting the new modem before Tuesday, or will the tech bring it?

Agent: The tech will bring it with them on Tuesday, so you don't need to worry about it ahead of time.

Customer: Awesome. I think that's all I need. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome! I'm gonna send a confirmation email to the address on your account. You'll get all the details about your appointment there. If you have any questions before Tuesday, just give us a call back. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate the upgrade!

Customer: Thanks!

Agent: Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now. (click)
