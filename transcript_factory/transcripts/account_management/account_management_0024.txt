Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I'm thinking about upgrading my internet service. I've had the same plan for like... three years now, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: Sure, it's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing here you're on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. So my kids are doing remote learning now, my wife's working from home, and we're constantly having issues with lag and buffering, especially when multiple people are on at the same time. I think we need something faster.

Agent: I completely understand. Remote work and online schooling definitely put more demand on your connection. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you thinking something in the Fiber 200 range, or would you want to go even higher?

Customer: Honestly, I'm not sure. What do you recommend? How much higher can we go?

Agent: Great question. So, we have several options available in your area. We offer Fiber 200, Fiber 500, and our top-tier Fiber 1 Gig plan. For a household with multiple people streaming, video conferencing, and online schooling, I'd typically recommend starting with the Fiber 500. That should give you plenty of bandwidth with some room to grow. But the Fiber 1 Gig is also available if you want maximum performance.

Customer: What's the price difference between those two?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so your current Fiber 100 is $79.99 a month. If you upgrade to Fiber 500, that would be $119.99 a month, so an increase of forty dollars. And the Fiber 1 Gig plan is $159.99 per month. We do have a promotional offer right now where if you sign a two-year agreement, we can knock thirty dollars off the first year for either of those plans.

Customer: Really? So Fiber 500 would be... ninety dollars for the first year?

Agent: Exactly, yeah. $89.99 per month for the first twelve months, then it goes to the regular $119.99 after that. And that includes all the same equipment and installation at no charge.

Customer: Okay, that's actually pretty reasonable. But I have to ask—how long would it take to upgrade? We've had some bad experiences with service outages in the neighborhood before, and I'm kind of nervous about the installation process.

Agent: (pause) That's a fair concern. So the installation typically takes between two to four hours, and yeah, your service would be down during that time. But we schedule it at your convenience—weekday, weekend, mornings, afternoons, whatever works best for you. And we always call the day before to confirm. As for neighborhood issues, those are usually localized, so an upgrade to your home service shouldn't cause any problems like that. We're literally just upgrading the equipment and the fiber line coming into your house.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. And you said installation is free?

Agent: Yes, completely free. The technician will bring everything, install it, test it all out, and make sure you're up and running before they leave.

Customer: Alright, I think Fiber 500 with that promotional rate sounds good. Let me just ask my wife real quick... (muffled conversation in background) Yeah, she's on board. When could we get this set up?

Agent: Wonderful! Let me check availability for you. (typing sounds) What part of the month works best for you? We have pretty good availability right now.

Customer: Um, probably next week sometime? Preferably a weekday afternoon, like after 2 PM?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have... How about Wednesday, March 15th between 2 and 4 PM?

Customer: Yeah, that works perfectly.

Agent: Awesome. So just to confirm everything... (typing sounds) We're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500. The promo rate of $89.99 per month for the first year, then $119.99 after that. Two-year agreement. Installation scheduled for Wednesday, March 15th between 2 and 4 PM. Is there anything else I should add?

Customer: I think that covers it. Oh, one more thing—do I need to do anything to prepare? Like, should I unplug my router or anything before the technician arrives?

Agent: Good question. You don't need to do anything in advance. Just make sure someone's home to let the technician in, and they'll take care of everything. They might ask you to unplug things during the install, but they'll walk you through it. We'll also email you a confirmation with all the details and the technician's contact information about 24 hours before the appointment.

Customer: Perfect. I think we're all set then.

Agent: Great! I'm going to process this upgrade for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, and... done. Your confirmation number is 7429-FR-5847. You should receive an email within the next few minutes with all your account details and the installation appointment information.

Customer: Awesome, thank you so much for your help, Marcus. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. If you have any questions before the installation, just give us a call back or check your email. We're here to help.

Customer: Will do. Have a great day!

Agent: You too, thanks for calling Frontier!
