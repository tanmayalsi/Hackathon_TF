Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you sticking with us! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment while I pull that up... Got it here. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I mean, it was fine when I first signed up, but now with everyone working from home and streaming and all that, it's just gotten too slow. My wife's on video calls all day, and the kids are doing online school... it's just not enough bandwidth.

Agent: (pause) I totally understand. That's a really common situation, especially with multiple devices. The good news is you're already in an area with our fiber infrastructure, so we have some great options for you. What kind of speeds are you typically seeing right now?

Customer: Honestly, I'm not totally sure of the exact numbers, but like... pages take forever to load sometimes, and when my wife's on a Zoom call and someone tries to stream something, it just buffers like crazy. It's frustrating.

Agent: Yeah, that definitely sounds like you're hitting the limits of your current bandwidth. Let me tell you about what we have available. We offer Fiber 300, which is three times faster than what you have now. We also have Fiber 500 and our top tier, Fiber 1 Gig, which is our gigabit service. Have you heard about any of those?

Customer: I've seen some ads for the gigabit thing, but honestly, that seems like overkill for what we need. What's the pricing difference between the 300 and the 500?

Agent: (typing sounds) Good question. So with Fiber 300, you'd be looking at $79.99 a month, and Fiber 500 is $99.99 a month. Both come with our standard equipment rental included. And here's the thing—since you've been such a loyal customer, let me see what I can do for you... (pause, more typing) I can offer you a promotion where we'd lock in your rate for the first 12 months at $79.99 for Fiber 300. That's a $20 a month savings from our standard rate.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad. What about the 500? Is there anything you can do there?

Agent: Let me check... (pause) I can do $89.99 for the first year on the Fiber 500. So you'd save ten dollars a month there as well.

Customer: Hmm, okay. What's the actual difference going to be, like, in real terms? I mean, 300 versus 500... is it going to make that much of a difference?

Agent: That's a great question. So 300 meg is definitely more than enough for what you described—multiple video calls, streaming, online school, all of that. You'd have plenty of headroom. The 500 is really if you're doing more intensive stuff like large file transfers, gaming, or if you just want that extra buffer for future use. For most households with three or four devices going at once, 300 is really the sweet spot.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. I think the 300 sounds good then. Can you upgrade me today?

Agent: Absolutely, I can definitely get that set up for you right now. One quick thing—do you own your modem and router, or are you leasing them from us?

Customer: I think I'm leasing? I'm not really sure, to be honest.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check your account... Yep, you've got our standard equipment. So no worries there. The good news is our new Fiber 300 modem is compatible with your current setup, so we can get you upgraded without needing a technician visit. We can ship out the new modem to you, and the upgrade to your service line can be active within 24 hours.

Customer: Wait, really? I don't need anyone to come out?

Agent: Nope! Since it's just a service tier upgrade and you already have our equipment, it's all handled remotely on our end. We'll overnight the modem to you—should arrive by tomorrow or the next day depending on your area—and once you plug it in and restart your connection, you're all set. We'll send you instructions via email and SMS.

Customer: That's fantastic, actually. I was worried about scheduling someone to come out and all that.

Agent: (laughs) Yeah, we try to make it as simple as possible. So let me just confirm the details here. I'm upgrading your account to Fiber 300 at $79.99 a month for the first 12 months, then it goes to the regular rate of $99.99 after that. Your service upgrade takes effect immediately, though your speeds won't fully activate until you receive and set up the new modem. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect. What's the new modem?

Agent: It's our Quantum Gateway model—pretty solid piece of equipment. It supports WiFi 6, so if you've got compatible devices, you'll see some speed improvements on the wireless side too. And the setup is really straightforward. Do you have any other questions for me?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that covers it. Will I get a confirmation email or something?

Agent: Definitely. You'll get an email confirmation with all your new plan details, and then you'll get another email once we dispatch your modem with tracking information. You can follow the package right to your door. Is the email on file still good? Let me see... it's [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, so your upgrade is all set! You should see improved performance once that modem arrives and is activated. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Marcus, I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and enjoy that faster internet. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!
