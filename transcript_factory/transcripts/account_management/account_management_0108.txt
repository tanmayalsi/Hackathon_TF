Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I currently have the 100 meg plan, and I'm thinking I need something faster.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you explore upgrade options. Let me just pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got you here. I'm showing you've been with us for about three years now on our 100 megabit plan. That's wonderful. And what's prompting the upgrade today? Are you working from home, or...?

Customer: Yeah, actually, we've got two kids doing remote learning now, and my wife and I are both working from home. So we're all competing for bandwidth, you know? Zoom calls are lagging, streaming keeps buffering... it's just become a nightmare.

Agent: Oh man, I totally understand. That's actually really common what we're hearing from families right now. (pause) So with multiple video conferences happening simultaneously, you're definitely going to want more headroom. We have a few options that would really help you out. We offer 400 megabits, which is a pretty popular choice for that exact scenario, and then we also have our gigabit plan at 940 megs if you want the absolute best performance.

Customer: Okay, so what's the price difference between those two?

Agent: (typing sounds) So your current plan is $79.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Perfect. The 400 meg plan would be $109.99 a month, so that's a $30 increase. And then the gigabit plan is $149.99 monthly. Now, I should mention—are you still within a promotional period on your current plan, or...?

Customer: I don't think so. I've been on this plan for like... I don't know, at least a year and a half without any changes.

Agent: Okay, so you're out of promo. Here's the good news though—since you're an existing customer and you're upgrading, I can actually offer you a promotional rate on either of these plans. (pause) For the 400 meg, I can get you that for $89.99 for the first twelve months, and then it goes to the regular rate. Would that work better for you?

Customer: Oh, that's nice! Um... (pause) can you tell me the difference between 400 and the gigabit? Like, would I really notice it?

Agent: That's a great question. Honestly, for most home situations, 400 megs is plenty. But if you're talking about three people on video calls, plus streaming, plus someone downloading large files... (pause) the gigabit does give you that extra cushion. It's future-proofing too, if your needs grow. But I don't want to oversell you something you don't need, you know?

Customer: Right, I appreciate that. What would the promo rate be on the gigabit?

Agent: Let me see here... (typing sounds) I can do $129.99 for the first year on the gigabit plan. That's a $20 savings off the regular rate each month.

Customer: (pause) Wow, okay. So that's a fifty dollar jump from what I'm paying now, but I get the unlimited bandwidth?

Agent: Well, just to clarify—our plans aren't actually limited by a data cap. All of our fiber plans are unlimited usage, so that's not changing. What you're really getting with the gigabit is the speed. You'll get faster downloads, faster uploads, more consistent performance when multiple people are online. (pause) Personally? With your situation, I think the 400 meg would actually handle things really well and save you some money.

Customer: Yeah, I think I'm leaning toward that. The 400 meg with the promo rate.

Agent: Excellent choice. (typing sounds) So let me just confirm the details here. I'm going to upgrade you from 100 to 400 megabits at $89.99 monthly for the first twelve months. After that, it'll be $109.99. Does that sound right?

Customer: Yep, that's good. How soon can you get that activated?

Agent: Perfect. We can actually have a technician out to upgrade your equipment as early as tomorrow, or if you prefer, we have availability later this week. What works best for your schedule?

Customer: Tomorrow? Really? (pause) Okay, tomorrow would be amazing, actually.

Agent: Great! (typing sounds) What time window works for you? We have morning, which is 8 a.m. to noon, afternoon from noon to 5 p.m., or evening from 5 to 8 p.m.?

Customer: The afternoon slot, please. That way the kids' school day is over.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you down for tomorrow between noon and 5 p.m. The technician will replace your modem and router with our newer fiber-compatible equipment. The whole process takes about an hour or so. And just so you know, there will be a brief service interruption during that changeover.

Customer: Okay, that's fine. Um, is there any install fee or anything?

Agent: Let me check... (pause) Since you're an existing customer upgrading, we're waiving the installation fee for you. This upgrade is just the monthly rate change.

Customer: Oh, that's great! I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome! (pause) So just to recap everything—tomorrow between noon and 5 p.m., technician will be out, upgrade to 400 meg fiber at the promotional rate, and we'll get you all set up. You should see a massive improvement right away. (pause) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. This should really help things out.

Agent: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and for being a loyal customer. We really appreciate your business. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all your appointment details and information about your new service.

Customer: Great, thank you so much.

Agent: My pleasure! Have a great rest of your day, and we'll see you tomorrow.

Customer: Thanks, bye!

Agent: Bye now! (call ends)
