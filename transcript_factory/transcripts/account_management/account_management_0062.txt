# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm just... I'm really not happy with my current speeds. I think I'm on like the 100 meg plan or something?

Agent: Okay, no problem. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan at $59.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right. But honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore. My kids are doing school from home, my wife's working remotely... we've got like five devices going at once and everything just slows to a crawl, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. Yeah, with multiple users and remote work, 100 megs can definitely get stretched thin pretty fast. The good news is we have some great options available at your address. Let me see what we can offer you.

Customer: Okay, good.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, so we have our Fiber 300 plan, which gives you 300 megabits per second download speeds. That's gonna be more than enough for what you're describing. That's $79.99 a month. We also have Fiber 500 at $99.99, and then our top tier Fiber Gig for $129.99, which gives you gigabit speeds.

Customer: Wow, okay. So what's the... what's the real difference between the 300 and the 500? Like, would I really notice it?

Agent: That's a great question. For what you mentioned—remote work, online school, streaming—the 300 plan would handle all of that really smoothly. The 500 is more if you've got like... heavy gamers in the house, lots of 4K streaming happening simultaneously, that kind of thing. Most families find 300 is the sweet spot for value.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think 300 sounds good. How much would that cost me compared to what I'm paying now?

Agent: So you'd go from $59.99 to $79.99, so that's about $20 more per month. But here's the thing—since you've been a loyal customer for three years, I can actually apply a promotional discount. I can get you that Fiber 300 plan for the first twelve months at $69.99 instead of $79.99. That way you're only paying about $10 more than you are now.

Customer: Oh really? That's actually... that's pretty good. (pause) And this is fiber, right? Like actual fiber to the house?

Agent: Yes, sir. We've already got fiber run to your location—you're in a great service area—so this is just an upgrade to a higher tier. You'll see the speed improvement pretty much immediately.

Customer: Nice. And there's no like... equipment fee or anything?

Agent: (brief pause) Your modem and router are already installed from your current service, so there's no additional equipment charge. The upgrade is just the speed tier change. Everything can be switched over remotely on our end, and you'll have the new speeds active within 24 hours.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. When can you get this set up?

Agent: I can process this upgrade right now for you, actually. It'll take me just a couple minutes. Can I confirm a few details first? Your service address is still 1247 Maple Drive in Riverside?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great. And the best number to reach you on if we need to contact you is 555-0147?

Customer: Actually, you can use my cell. It's 555-0298.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Updating that now. So just to recap everything—we're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300. Your promotional rate is $69.99 for the first 12 months, then it'll go to the regular $79.99 after that. The upgrade will be active within 24 hours. You'll start seeing those faster speeds right away.

Customer: Perfect. That sounds great.

Agent: And you know, if you ever need to upgrade further down the line, just give us a call back. We're always here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks Derek, I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome! Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You're all set. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!
