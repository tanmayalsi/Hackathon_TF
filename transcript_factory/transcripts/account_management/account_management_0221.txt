# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So I've had your internet service for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Got it. I'm showing you're currently on our Fiber 200 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Two hundred megabits, right? It was great when I first got it, but now I work from home, and my wife streams Netflix, and our kids are always watching YouTube. It just... it buffers a lot, you know?

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. With multiple devices, 200 megs can definitely get overwhelmed pretty quickly. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking at upgrading to? We have Fiber 500, Fiber 1 gig, and our premium Fiber 2 gig option.

Customer: What's the difference in price? I don't want to break the bank, but I also don't want to keep dealing with this frustration.

Agent: That's a fair question. So you're currently at, let me see here... (typing sounds) forty-nine ninety-nine a month. If you upgrade to Fiber 500, that would be sixty-nine ninety-nine. The 1 gig is eighty-nine ninety-nine, and the 2 gig is one hundred nineteen ninety-nine.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) What about a promotion or something? Do you have any new customer deals or... I don't know, loyalty discounts?

Agent: Let me check what we have available right now. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so because you've been with us for three years, I can definitely work with you here. We actually have a current promotion where if you upgrade to the 1 gig plan, I can lock you in at seventy-nine ninety-nine for the first twelve months. After that it goes to the regular rate of eighty-nine ninety-nine.

Customer: So that's an extra thirty dollars a month for like, five times the speed?

Agent: Exactly. With our 1 gig plan, you get one thousand megabits per second compared to your current 200. That's more than enough for multiple streams, remote work, everything. And honestly, at that speed, you really won't have any buffering issues.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. That actually sounds pretty good. Can I ask... is that fiber all the way to my house? Because I've heard sometimes it's fiber to the box and then copper the rest of the way.

Agent: That's a really good question. (typing sounds) Yes, you're in one of our areas where we have true fiber-to-the-home service, so you're getting the full fiber connection all the way to your residence. That's actually why you get those speeds.

Customer: Nice. Alright, let's do it then. The 1 gig for seventy-nine ninety-nine for a year.

Agent: Awesome! I'm really excited for you. You're going to notice a huge difference. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to get that set up for you. Now, the upgrade won't require any new equipment on your end—you'll just need to restart your gateway at some point after we flip the switch, which should be... (pause) (typing sounds) ...this Friday evening around 8 PM. Is that a good time?

Customer: Friday evening? Yeah, that should be fine. It's just a restart, right? It'll come back online?

Agent: Right, exactly. It'll take about five to ten minutes total. You might lose internet for a few minutes, but then it'll come back and you'll be all set with the upgraded speeds.

Customer: Okay, cool. And this rate—the seventy-nine ninety-nine—that's locked in for twelve months from today?

Agent: Yes, sir. Locked in for twelve full months. After that, it'll be eighty-nine ninety-nine per month unless we have another promotion available at that time. I'm going to email you a confirmation of this change, and I'll also include a note about the Friday maintenance window. Do we have the email on file as [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, let me just do a final review here. You're upgrading from Fiber 200 to Fiber 1 gig, promotional rate of seventy-nine ninety-nine for twelve months, service activation Friday, November 17th at 8 PM. Does everything look good?

Customer: Yeah, that all sounds right. When will I actually see the speeds, though? Like, after Friday?

Agent: Yep. Once that Friday maintenance completes and your gateway restarts, you should be seeing those 1 gig speeds pretty much immediately. You can actually test your speeds using our speed test tool on the Frontier website if you want to verify everything's working properly.

Customer: Great. I'll definitely do that. Thanks for helping me out with this.

Agent: You're very welcome. I really appreciate you sticking with Frontier, and I think you're going to be really happy with the upgrade. If you have any issues during that Friday window or anything comes up before then, just give us a call back and we'll take care of it. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate it, Marcus.

Agent: Alright, perfect. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
