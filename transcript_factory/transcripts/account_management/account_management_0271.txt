# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I currently have the 100 meg plan, and I've been thinking about going faster.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years now on our 100 Mbps fiber plan. That's fantastic. And just out of curiosity, what's prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, streaming, or...?

Customer: A bit of everything, honestly. We've got four people in the house now—my wife, our two kids, and my mother-in-law moved in with us last year. So between video calls for work, the kids doing online school, Netflix... it just feels like things are bogging down sometimes, you know?

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally get that. Four people can definitely put a strain on 100 megs, especially if you've got multiple devices going at once. (pause) So we actually have a couple of great options for you. We offer 300 Mbps and our top tier, which is our 1 gigabit fiber plan. Both are available in your area.

Customer: Wow, okay. What's the difference in price between those?

Agent: (typing) So your current plan is $59.99 a month. The 300 Mbps plan would be $79.99 a month, and the gig plan is $99.99 a month. Now, I should mention that we're running a promotion right now where new speeds get their first three months at half off.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad. So that would be like $40 for the first three months?

Agent: Exactly! And then it goes to the regular price after that. Can I ask... are you thinking more about the 300, or would the gigabit be interesting to you?

Customer: (pause) I mean... what would you recommend? Honestly, I don't want to overkill it, but I also don't want to have the same problem in a year or two.

Agent: That's smart thinking. You know, with four people and the way streaming and video calls have become standard, I'd actually lean toward the gig plan. It's future-proof. You get ten times the speed you have now, and honestly, at thirty dollars more a month, it's a pretty good value. Plus, with the kids doing schoolwork, your mom potentially doing her own thing... you'll really notice the difference.

Customer: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, let's do the gigabit plan. How soon can you get that switched over?

Agent: Excellent choice! (typing sounds) So here's the thing—since you're already a fiber customer, the infrastructure is already there, so we can typically do this as a software upgrade. It could happen as soon as tomorrow, but usually takes about 24 to 48 hours. You won't need a technician visit or anything like that.

Customer: Oh wow, really? That's great!

Agent: Yeah, it's one of the perks of fiber. Now, I do want to let you know that your modem might need an update as well. What modem are you currently using?

Customer: Uh... (pause) I'm not really sure? It's the one you guys gave me when we set up the service three years ago. It's just a little white box.

Agent: (chuckling) Okay, so we may want to upgrade that too. If you'd like, we can ship you a new one at no charge, or you can pick one up at a local retail location. The new modem will handle the gigabit speeds much better.

Customer: Free is good. (laughing) Let's do the free option.

Agent: (typing) Perfect. (pause) Alright, so I'm going to process this upgrade for you right now. Let me just recap everything to make sure we're on the same page. You're upgrading from the 100 Mbps plan to our 1 Gbps fiber plan. Your new rate will be $99.99 a month, but with the promo, you'll pay $49.99 for the first three months. We'll ship you a new modem at no charge, and the service upgrade should be active within 48 hours.

Customer: That sounds perfect. How will I know when it's actually activated?

Agent: You should see a speed increase pretty quickly once it goes live. If you want, you can run a speed test on your phone or computer—just Google "speed test" and it'll give you your current speeds. But honestly, you'll probably just notice everything loads faster. Also, we'll send you an email and a text confirming the upgrade.

Customer: Great, great. And the modem—how long does that usually take to arrive?

Agent: Typically three to five business days. And it'll come with all the cables and instructions. If you have any issues setting it up, just give us a call back and we can walk you through it.

Customer: Okay, perfect. I think that covers everything. Thanks so much for your help, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think we're all set.

Agent: Awesome. Well, thanks again for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You should see that speed increase real soon, and I think your whole family is going to notice a big difference.

Customer: I'm sure they will. Thanks again!

Agent: Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
