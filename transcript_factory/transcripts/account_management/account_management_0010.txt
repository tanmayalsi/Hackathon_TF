Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 meg plan, and honestly, I'm just not getting the speeds I need anymore. I've been working from home a lot more, and my wife streams constantly, so... I think it's time to upgrade.

Agent: I completely understand. Working from home and streaming can definitely eat up your bandwidth. Let me pull up your account here real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) And is that 555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect, I've got you here. So you're on our 500 meg symmetrical fiber plan. That's great you already have fiber to the home. (pause) Just out of curiosity, what kind of speeds are you looking at needing?

Customer: Well, I'm not really sure what the ideal is, but I feel like things are just... sluggish sometimes. Like, when my wife is watching Netflix in 4K and I'm trying to video conference for work, that's when things really get bad.

Agent: Yeah, that's a really common scenario. The good news is you've got some excellent options available at your address. We can upgrade you to our 1 gig plan, which is our fastest residential service. That's 1,000 meg download and 1,000 meg upload. For most people, that handles multiple HD streams and heavy work usage without any issues.

Customer: Okay, so a full gig. That sounds... actually, is that overkill? I mean, what's the price difference?

Agent: That's a fair question. Let me see what we can do for you. (pause, typing sounds) So your current plan is $79.99 a month, and our 1 gig plan would be $119.99 per month. But I'm actually looking at a promotion right now. If you switch to the gig plan, I can get you the first six months at $89.99, so you'd save about thirty bucks a month for the first half year.

Customer: Oh, that's not too bad actually. What happens after the six months?

Agent: After the promotional period, yes, it would go to the regular rate of $119.99. But you'd have the option to call back if rates change or if you want to explore other options at that time. And honestly, a lot of customers find that the performance is so much better, they don't even mind paying the full price.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean, I think that makes sense. Can you also... is there any way to get a better deal on the installation or anything? Do I need a technician to come out?

Agent: Great question. So with fiber, the upgrade is actually pretty straightforward. Since you already have the fiber line installed, we don't typically need to send a technician out for a speed tier upgrade. We can provision it on our end. However, there will be a small service fee of $35.99 for the account modification and equipment swap if needed.

Customer: Wait, equipment swap? I thought you said we didn't need a technician.

Agent: Right, sorry for any confusion. The equipment swap is something you can do yourself—it's just a modem upgrade, which we'll mail to you. It takes about five minutes to install. Plug in the new modem, and you're good to go. The $35.99 is just the service fee on your account to make those changes.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. Can you waive that fee? Since I've been a customer for... how long have I been with you guys?

Agent: (typing) Let's see... you've been with us for about three years now. That's excellent loyalty. You know what, let me see what I can do here. (pause) I'm going to waive that service fee for you today. Consider it a thank you for being a longtime Frontier customer.

Customer: Oh wow, that's great! Thank you. So when can this be switched over?

Agent: I appreciate you saying that. (pause) I can process this upgrade for you right now, and it would be effective... let me see... we can have this activated either tonight or tomorrow morning. The modem should arrive within three to five business days. Once it's here, just unbox it, connect it to your ONT box, and restart your connection. You'll notice the difference right away.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. And the pricing... just to confirm, it's $89.99 for the first six months, then $119.99 after that?

Agent: That's correct. $89.99 for six months, $119.99 after that. And no service fee today. (typing sounds) I'm gonna go ahead and push through this upgrade for you now. Just give me one second here...

Customer: Sure, go ahead.

Agent: (pause, typing) Alright, I'm getting a confirmation here. Your upgrade to 1 gig fiber has been approved and will be active by tomorrow morning. You should see an email confirmation within the next hour or so with all the details and your new modem tracking information.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. Just keep an eye out for that modem shipment, and when it arrives, follow the simple installation instructions that come with it. If you have any issues once you get the new modem, you can always give us a call back or check out our online support portal.

Customer: Great, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a valued Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. Enjoy those faster speeds, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.

Customer: Will do. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Take care!
