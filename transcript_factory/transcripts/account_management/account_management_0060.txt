Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications! This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. I've had the basic plan for like... two years now? And I'm working from home more, so I need something faster.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. Okay, so I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan at $59.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. So like, what's the next step up?

Agent: (typing sounds) Well, we have a few options for you. Our next tier is Fiber 300, which gives you 300 megabits per second download speeds. That's perfect for working from home, video conferencing, streaming... it's really solid. And then we also have Fiber 500 if you want even faster speeds.

Customer: What's the difference in price?

Agent: So the Fiber 300 would be $79.99 a month, and the Fiber 500 is $99.99 a month. Both come with our standard equipment and everything, so there's no additional installation fee since you're already a fiber customer.

Customer: Okay, and like... how much faster is that actually gonna feel? I'm not super tech-savvy, so...

Agent: (pause) That's a great question. So your current 100 megabits is pretty good for basic browsing and email, but if you're working from home and maybe uploading files or doing video calls with multiple people, you might notice some lag. With 300 megabits, you'll see things load way faster, and you can handle multiple devices streaming at the same time without any issues.

Customer: Multiple people on video calls though? Like Zoom meetings and stuff?

Agent: Exactly, yeah. Zoom, Teams, Google Meet—all of that. You could have a video call going while someone else in your house is streaming Netflix and you're still getting great performance.

Customer: Hmm, that's... that actually sounds pretty good. What about the 500? Is it like... noticeably different, or...?

Agent: The 500 is really overkill unless you're doing like heavy file transfers, uploading large video files, things like that. For working from home and general use, the 300 is honestly the sweet spot. You'd probably be really happy with it.

Customer: Okay, so I'm leaning toward the 300 then. Um, are there any... like, promotions or anything right now?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check what we have available for you... (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any active promotions for your area at this exact moment, but I do have something here—if you commit to a one-year term, I can knock $10 off your first month. So your first month would be $69.99, and then it goes to the regular $79.99 after that.

Customer: Oh, that's good. Yeah, I can do a one-year term. How soon could you get that set up?

Agent: It's pretty quick! Since you're already on fiber, I can activate the upgrade today. Your new speeds would be active by tomorrow morning. We might need to reboot your modem, but that's it—no technician visit necessary.

Customer: Tomorrow? Okay, that's awesome.

Agent: (typing sounds) Excellent. So just to confirm, you want to upgrade from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300 at $79.99 a month with the promotional first month at $69.99. And you're agreeing to a twelve-month service agreement, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's all correct.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Alright, I'm processing that now... (typing sounds) Okay, so your upgrade is all set! Your new plan becomes active tomorrow at 5 AM, and you'll see the speed increase right away once your modem reboots. You should get a confirmation email within the next few minutes.

Customer: Great, that's... that's really easy. Thank you so much.

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. If you have any questions or issues over the next few days, just don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!
