Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm calling because I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've got some great options available. Before we dive in, let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I'm seeing here that you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've had it for about... I don't know, two years now? And honestly, it was fine at first, but now I'm working from home more, my wife streams constantly, and we've got, like, three different devices going at once. It just keeps buffering.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, that's a really common issue when you've got multiple people and devices on the network. Two years ago that probably would've been plenty, but usage patterns have definitely changed. So Fiber 100 means you're getting around 100 megabits per second download speeds, which can get pretty tight with that kind of household activity.

Customer: Right, exactly. So what would you recommend?

Agent: Well, we've got a few options. We offer Fiber 200, Fiber 500, and our top tier is Fiber 1 Gig, which gives you 1 gigabit per second. For your situation with multiple users and streaming, I'd probably recommend starting with our Fiber 500 plan. That's a really nice sweet spot for most households. But let me ask—do you have any 4K devices or are you doing any gaming at all?

Customer: Um, we do have a 4K TV, and my son plays some online games. Nothing too intense, but yeah, he's always complaining about lag.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so the Fiber 500 would definitely help with that. Your son would see a significant improvement in his gaming performance, and your 4K streaming would be much smoother. Plus it gives you plenty of headroom for everyone to use things simultaneously without everything slowing down.

Customer: That sounds good. What's the pricing on that?

Agent: So right now we're running a promotion. The Fiber 500 plan is $79.99 per month for the first year, then it goes to our regular rate of $94.99 after that. Your current plan is what, around $59.99?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. So it'd be like a twenty dollar increase?

Agent: Right, so about $20 more initially, but remember you're getting five times the speed. And honestly, once you go back to the regular rate, it's still only about $35 more than what you're paying now, and you'd be getting speeds that are worth it.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And how quickly could you get that installed? Or... do I need a technician to come out or what?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great question. Since you already have our Fiber service, we can actually just push a configuration change to your equipment, and you should see the upgrade take effect pretty quickly. In most cases, it's same-day or next business day. You wouldn't need a technician to come out unless you want to add any additional equipment or if you wanted to move your router to a different location.

Customer: Oh nice, that's easier than I thought.

Agent: Yeah, we try to keep it simple when we can. So would you like me to go ahead and get you set up with the Fiber 500 plan? I'll just need to confirm a couple of details, and then we can get you all switched over.

Customer: Um, before you do that—are there any other fees or anything I should know about? Like, activation fees or whatever?

Agent: That's a really good question. (pause) So since you're an existing customer upgrading, we waive the activation fee. You'll just have the monthly service charge. The only other thing would be if you wanted to add any premium channels or services, but for the internet upgrade itself, no surprise fees.

Customer: Awesome. Yeah, let's do it then.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just confirm your service address here. I'm showing 4821 Maple Drive, apartment 3B, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And your email address on file is [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Actually, no, it's [inaudible]@outlook.com. Can you update that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely, I'm updating that right now. Okay, so to recap: we're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500 at $79.99 per month for the first year. You shouldn't need a technician visit, and the upgrade should be active by tomorrow morning at the latest. You'll receive a confirmation email at your new address, and if for any reason you don't see the speed improvement within 24 hours, just give us a call back and we'll troubleshoot it for you.

Customer: That's great. How do I know if it's actually working? Like, how do I test it?

Agent: Oh, good point. You can actually go to our website—it's frontieronline.com—and there's a speed test tool right there on the homepage. Or you can use Speedtest.net, that's a third-party site, either one works. You should see speeds in the 400 to 500 range if everything's working properly.

Customer: Cool. And the changes go into effect when?

Agent: So I'm showing here that it should process through our system within the next couple hours, and then the configuration pushes out overnight. So yeah, most likely tomorrow morning when you wake up. You might notice your internet drop for just a couple seconds during that update, but that's totally normal.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks Marcus, I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You should be all set. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
