Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan, and honestly, I'm thinking about upgrading. My work from home situation has gotten a lot busier, and I feel like I'm hitting some speed bumps, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. Work from home can definitely put a strain on your connection, especially if you're uploading files or doing video calls. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got you here. Okay, so you're currently on our 500 Meg plan, and that's been active for about... looks like two years now. What kind of speeds are you looking to upgrade to?

Customer: Well, what do you have available? I mean, I don't necessarily need to go crazy, but something faster would be nice. What's the next step up?

Agent: Great question. So we have several options in your area. We can upgrade you to our 1 gigabit fiber service, which is our most popular plan for remote workers. We also have a 2 gig option if you really want maximum speeds. (pause) Are there multiple people in your household using the internet at the same time?

Customer: Yeah, so it's me working from home, my wife's also remote, and then we've got two kids who are always streaming something or doing online school stuff. So yeah, it can get pretty congested.

Agent: Okay, that definitely sounds like a good candidate for at least the gig service, if not the 2 gig. With two people on video calls simultaneously plus streaming, the 500 meg can get a bit tight. The 1 gig would give you plenty of headroom, and honestly, the price difference isn't huge.

Customer: Okay, so what would that cost me? I'm currently paying... (pause) I think it's like 79 a month?

Agent: Let me check your current pricing. (typing sounds) Yes, you're at $79.99 for the 500 meg plan. The 1 gigabit plan is $99.99 per month for the first year, and then it goes to $119.99 after that. However, we do have a promotion running right now for existing customers, so I can lock you in at $99.99 for two years instead of just one.

Customer: Oh, okay, that's not too bad. What about the 2 gig? Just out of curiosity.

Agent: The 2 gig is $149.99 for the first year, then $169.99. (pause) It's definitely overkill for most situations, but if you want absolute maximum performance and you're willing to spend a little more, it's there. Most people in your situation find the 1 gig sweet spot though.

Customer: Yeah, I think the 1 gig makes more sense. But I have a question—do I need new equipment? I've got the modem and router you guys gave me a couple years ago.

Agent: That's a smart question. Your current modem... (typing sounds) ...the Arris unit you have, it's actually not compatible with our 1 gig speeds. The 500 meg plan maxes out what that modem can handle. So we would need to send you a new WiFi 6 gateway. The good news is there's no installation fee, and we'll just ship it to you for free. You can do a self-install—it usually takes about ten minutes. We can also schedule a technician if you'd prefer, but most customers find it pretty straightforward.

Customer: No, self-install is fine. I'm fairly tech-savvy. How long does shipping take?

Agent: We can get it to you within 3 to 5 business days, typically. Once you receive it, you'd just power down your current modem, unplug it, and plug in the new gateway. It'll walk you through the setup on your phone or computer. You'll actually see an immediate speed improvement once it boots up.

Customer: Perfect. And just to confirm, there's no installation fee or anything like that?

Agent: No installation fee at all. The equipment is free, shipping is free, and there's no technician charge. The only thing that changes is your monthly bill goes from $79.99 to $99.99, and that rate is locked for two years with the promotion.

Customer: That sounds great, Derek. Let's do it. Let's upgrade to the 1 gig.

Agent: Awesome, I'm really glad we could get you set up. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm processing that upgrade now. Let me just confirm the details with you. You're upgrading from 500 meg to 1 gigabit fiber, your new rate is $99.99 per month for 24 months, and your new gateway will ship out today. You should receive it within 3 to 5 business days. (pause) Did I get all that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that all sounds right. When does the new charge take effect?

Agent: Your new plan goes into effect on the next billing cycle, which looks like... (typing sounds) ...March 15th. So you'll see the new rate on your bill at that time. And your old modem—you can either recycle it or just toss it. You don't need to return it to us.

Customer: Great. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: Just one thing—once you get the gateway, if you have any issues with the setup, you can always call us back and we'll walk you through it. But I think you'll find it's pretty plug-and-play. And if for any reason you're not happy with the upgrade in the first 30 days, we do have a satisfaction guarantee, so just give us a call.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks so much, Derek. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and enjoy those faster speeds. You're all set. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
