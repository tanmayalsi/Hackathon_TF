Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. My speeds have been pretty slow lately, and I'm working from home now, so I really need something faster.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 503-555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment... Got it. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine when I was just browsing and stuff, but now that I'm doing video calls all day for work, it's not cutting it anymore. My uploads are terrible too.

Agent: I totally understand. Working from home definitely requires more bandwidth. Let me tell you about some of your upgrade options. We have a few great Fiber plans available in your area. You could upgrade to our Fiber 300 plan, which gives you 300 Mbps down and 100 up. Or there's the Fiber 500, which is 500 down and 200 up. And then our top tier is Fiber Gig, which is one gigabit down and 500 up.

Customer: Wow, okay. Um, which one would you recommend for like, Zoom calls and stuff?

Agent: Great question. For Zoom and video conferencing, honestly, the Fiber 300 would be a solid upgrade for you and should handle multiple video calls without any issues. That gives you plenty of headroom. But if you're thinking about the future, or if other people in your household are also working from home or streaming...

Customer: Oh yeah, my wife works from home too, and my kids are doing school online right now, so there's definitely a lot happening on the network.

Agent: (pause) Okay, yeah, that changes things a bit. With multiple video calls happening simultaneously plus streaming, I'd actually recommend the Fiber 500 plan. That way you've got plenty of bandwidth to go around and you won't experience any lag or buffering. Does that sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that makes sense. What's the price difference?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here. So your current Fiber 100 plan is $79.99 a month. The Fiber 500 would be $119.99 a month, so you're looking at an additional $40 per month.

Customer: Okay, and... is there any kind of promotion or anything? I've been a customer for a while now.

Agent: That's a great question. Let me check what we have available for loyalty customers. (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any current promotions for the Fiber 500 specifically, but I do show that you'd get a one-time credit of $50 toward your first month of the new service, which would bring your first bill to $69.99 instead of $119.99.

Customer: Oh, that's helpful. So just the first month though?

Agent: Correct, yes. After that it'd be the regular $119.99 per month. But you know, if you wanted to lock in a price, we do have a one-year price guarantee where your rate won't increase during that year.

Customer: That's good to know. Um, how soon can you upgrade me? Do I need a technician to come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great news—since you're already set up with Fiber, we can actually do this upgrade remotely without needing a technician visit. I can process this change right now, and it would typically go into effect within 24 hours. You might see a brief service interruption of maybe 15-20 minutes sometime between now and tomorrow, but usually it's pretty seamless.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. That's way faster than I expected. Let's do it then.

Agent: Perfect. Let me just confirm some details to make sure everything is correct. Your service address is 1247 Oakmont Drive, Portland, Oregon 97201, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: And we'll be upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500, with the $50 first-month credit applied. The new monthly rate after that first month will be $119.99, and you'll have the one-year price lock in effect. Sound good?

Customer: Yep, that all sounds good.

Agent: (typing sounds) Excellent. And just to confirm, your email on file is [inaudible]@gmail.com. We'll send you a confirmation email with all these details within the next hour or so.

Customer: Perfect, yeah, that's good.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. This is gonna make such a difference for us.

Agent: I'm glad we could help. You should start seeing those faster speeds by tomorrow. If you have any issues during the upgrade or after, just give us a call back and we'll take care of you.

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
