Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've got some great options available. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Okay, so I'm looking here at your account. You're currently on our Frontier 100 plan, is that right? That's 100 megabits per second?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine for a while, but now I'm working from home a lot more, and my wife is streaming Netflix in the other room, and my kid's doing online classes... it's just getting really slow. Everything buffers.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, that's a pretty common situation we're seeing these days, especially post-pandemic. When you've got multiple devices going at once, 100 megs can definitely feel like it's not enough. The good news is we've got some fantastic options for you. (pause) What kind of speeds are you thinking about? Are you looking to maybe bump up to our 300 meg plan, or would you want to go all the way to our gigabit fiber?

Customer: Um... what's the difference? I mean, cost-wise and... just generally, what would I actually notice?

Agent: Great question. So our 300 meg plan—that's three times faster than what you've got now—that's typically really solid for households like yours. You'd be able to stream 4K video, have multiple video conferences going simultaneously, gaming, all that at the same time without really noticing any slowdown. That runs about... (typing sounds) ...let me see here... that would be $79.99 a month for the first 12 months, then it goes to our regular rate of $99.99.

Customer: Okay, and the gigabit one?

Agent: So our gigabit fiber plan—that's 1000 megabits per second—that's really our premium service. It's overkill for most people, honestly, but some customers just like having that extra headroom, future-proofing their home. That's $119.99 for the first year, then $139.99 after that.

Customer: (pause) Wow, that's... that's a pretty big jump. I mean, would I actually need that?

Agent: Honestly? For your situation, probably not. I think the 300 meg plan would serve you really well. Unless you're like... I don't know, running a small business with a ton of uploads and downloads, I'd say stick with the 300. You'll see a huge improvement from what you've got now, and you won't be paying for speed you're not using.

Customer: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So $79.99 a month—is that locked in? For how long?

Agent: For the first 12 months, yeah, that's locked in. After that, it goes to the regular rate. Although, I should mention—hold on one second, let me check something for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so you've been a customer for... looks like about four years now?

Customer: Yeah, something like that.

Agent: Perfect. Because you're a loyal customer, I can actually add a loyalty discount. So that would bring it down to $69.99 for the first 12 months. How's that sound?

Customer: Oh! (laughs) That's way better. Yeah, okay, I'm interested in that.

Agent: Awesome! And just so you know, there's no equipment fee for the upgrade, and our technician can come out and swap your modem at no charge. The installation is free. Do you have any preferred appointment times? We've got availability this coming week.

Customer: Um, let me think... Thursday or Friday would be best for me. I'm working from home, so I need to plan around that.

Agent: (typing sounds) I've got Thursday the 19th, we have a morning window between 8 and 12, or an afternoon window between 1 and 5. Which works better for you?

Customer: The afternoon is better. So 1 to 5 on Thursday?

Agent: Perfect. I've got you down for Thursday, January 19th, 1 to 5 PM. A technician will come by, it should only take about 30 minutes or so to get everything set up. You'll see that speed difference right away.

Customer: Great. Do I need to do anything before they get there?

Agent: Nope, just make sure someone's home. That's really it. Oh, and you should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details. If you don't see it in your inbox, check your spam folder just in case.

Customer: Okay, will do. Um, one more thing—when does this actually start? Like, when do the charges change?

Agent: Good question. So your new plan will be active starting the first of next month. Your next bill cycle starts February 1st, so you'll see the new rate and the new speeds kick in then. You've still got this month at your current rate.

Customer: Perfect. Alright, I think that's everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being such a great long-term customer. If you have any questions before Thursday, just give us a call back, okay?

Customer: I will. Thanks again, Marcus.

Agent: Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
