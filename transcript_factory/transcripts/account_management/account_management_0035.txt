Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, so I've had Frontier for about three years now and I'm pretty happy with it, but I'm thinking I might need to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, I'm glad you've been happy with us. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause, typing) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. So it looks like you're currently on our Gig Advantage plan—that's our 500 Mbps download speed. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right. I mean, it was fine when I first got it, but lately everything's been slower. My work-from-home situation has changed, and I've got my roommate streaming stuff constantly, so... it's just not keeping up anymore.

Agent: I totally understand. That's something we hear a lot, especially with multiple people using the connection. So, um, what kind of speeds are you looking at? Are you interested in our Gig Max plan, which would be our gigabit service at 1 Gig down, or would you want to look at something in between?

Customer: What's the pricing on that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so the Gig Max is $89.99 a month for the first 12 months, then it goes to $109.99 after that. But I should mention we do have a promotion running right now where if you commit to a two-year term, we can lock that rate in at $89.99 for the full two years.

Customer: Wait, really? That's... that's actually not bad. How much am I paying now?

Agent: You're currently at $79.99 a month on the Gig Advantage plan.

Customer: So it's only like an extra ten bucks? That's not too bad. But what if I just want to go month-to-month? Like, I might be moving in a few months, so I don't really want to lock into anything.

Agent: (pause) I totally get that. So if you go month-to-month without the contract, the Gig Max would be $99.99 a month. There's a bit of a difference there, but you'd have the flexibility you need.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Okay, how long would it take to install if I upgrade? And is there an installation fee?

Agent: Great question. So, we can typically get you scheduled within the next week or so, and since you're already a customer with our fiber infrastructure in your area, the installation is pretty straightforward. The good news is there's no installation fee for existing customers upgrading their service.

Customer: Oh, that's awesome. And I wouldn't have to change my modem or anything?

Agent: Actually, uh, that's a good point. You might need to swap out your equipment to take full advantage of the gigabit speeds. Let me just check your current setup here... (typing sounds, pause) So you've got the Quantum Gateway router with us right now, and honestly, that should be compatible, but we do offer a newer model, the Quantum X4 WiFi 6 router, which would really help you maximize those speeds, especially if you've got multiple devices connecting.

Customer: How much is that?

Agent: The upgrade to the Quantum X4 would be $15 additional a month, or you could purchase it outright for $199.

Customer: (pause) And if I don't upgrade the router, will the gigabit speeds still work okay?

Agent: You'll still get great speeds with your current router, but you might not see the full gigabit potential in certain areas of your home, especially further from the router. The WiFi 6 router would help with that. But it's totally optional.

Customer: Okay, I think I'll stick with what I have for now and see how it goes. Can I always upgrade later if I need to?

Agent: Absolutely, yeah, no problem at all. You can add that anytime down the road. So, let me just confirm—you want to go with the Gig Max plan at $99.99 a month, month-to-month with no contract, and keep your current equipment?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. When can you get someone out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, let me pull up the availability... (pause) So we have some openings tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we could do Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be perfect, actually. I've got the day off anyway.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm scheduling you for tomorrow, September 14th, between 8 AM and 12 PM. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive. Is the phone number on file, 555-0147, still the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's good.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap everything we've discussed—you're upgrading from the Gig Advantage plan to Gig Max, which is 1 Gig download speeds. Your rate is $99.99 a month, month-to-month. Installation is free, and you're scheduled for tomorrow morning between 8 AM and noon. You'll keep your current router and modem. Does all that sound right?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect. That's exactly what I want.

Agent: Great! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your loyalty as a customer. You should see a huge difference in your internet speeds once the upgrade goes live. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
