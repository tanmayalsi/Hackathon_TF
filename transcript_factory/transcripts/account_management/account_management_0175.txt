Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with the service, but I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: That's great to hear you've been happy with us. I'd be happy to help you explore upgrade options. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, I've got you here. Okay, so I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. A hundred down, I think? Look, my kids are doing online school now, and my wife's been working from home since the pandemic, and we're just... we're buffering a lot. It's frustrating.

Agent: I totally understand. With multiple people streaming and video conferencing at the same time, a hundred megs can definitely get stretched thin. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking at? Are you interested in bumping up to our 300 plan, or would you want to go even higher?

Customer: What's the highest you guys offer?

Agent: Great question. We've got several tiers. We can go up to our Fiber 500 plan, which gives you 500 megabits down. We also have a Fiber 1 Gig option, which is one gigabit. That's our top tier in your area.

Customer: Whoa, okay. (pause) That seems like... a lot. What's the price difference? I don't want to spend a fortune here.

Agent: (typing) Totally fair. Let me break this down for you. Your current plan is $69.99 a month. If you upgrade to Fiber 300, that would be $89.99. The 500 plan is $129.99, and the 1 Gig is $159.99.

Customer: Hmm. And there's no contract or anything with that?

Agent: Great question. So we don't have long-term contracts on any of our plans, which is one of the nice things about Frontier. You can change or cancel anytime. However, if you do upgrade today, I can actually get you a promotional rate for the first twelve months.

Customer: Oh yeah? What kind of rate?

Agent: (typing) So for the Fiber 500 plan, I can lock you in at $99.99 a month for your first year, then it goes to the regular $129.99 after that. That saves you thirty bucks a month for the first year.

Customer: That's not too bad actually. Would I need a new router or anything?

Agent: That's a smart question. The good news is that our current fiber equipment is already optimized for these higher speeds, so you shouldn't need anything new installed. The modem and router you have should work just fine.

Customer: And when could that take effect? Can you upgrade me today?

Agent: Absolutely. (pause) Typically for an upgrade like this, it's just a change to your account, so it could actually go into effect as early as tomorrow. However, let me just run through a few things to make sure. Are you still at 447 Maple Street?

Customer: Yep, that's still the address.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you want the Fiber 500 plan at the promotional rate of $99.99 for the first twelve months, then $129.99 after?

Customer: Yeah, let's do it. I think that makes sense.

Agent: (typing) Excellent. I'm going to set that up for you right now. (typing sounds continue, longer pause) Okay, so I'm seeing here that your new plan is being activated. You should see it take effect on your next billing cycle, which is... looks like next Monday. You'll get a confirmation email shortly at the email on file, which is [inaudible]. Does that still look right?

Customer: I think so, yeah. What was that email?

Agent: It looks like j.morrison47 at Gmail dot com. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you'll get a confirmation there, and then you should start experiencing those faster speeds right away once it's activated. I also want to make sure you know that if you do have any issues getting up to speed, you can always give us a call back and we can troubleshoot. Sometimes it takes a reboot of the equipment to get everything synced up properly.

Customer: Okay, good to know. And just to make sure—there's nothing else I need to do on my end?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. The upgrade is scheduled and handled. One more thing though—I do want to let you know that since you've been such a great customer for three years, I'm going to add a courtesy service credit to your account for $25, just as a thank you.

Customer: Oh, wow, that's... that's really nice of you, Derek. I appreciate that.

Agent: Of course! We value your business. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks so much.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and thank you for being a loyal customer. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
