Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. I've got the basic plan right now and it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me just pull that up here... Alright, I've got you. I see you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. What's prompting the upgrade today?

Customer: Well, my kids are doing remote school now, and we've got like three people video calling at the same time, plus my wife's working from home too. The connection just keeps dropping, and the speeds are terrible when everyone's online.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. With multiple devices and video conferencing, 100 megabits can definitely get stretched thin. How many devices are we talking about when everyone's using the internet simultaneously?

Customer: Uh, probably like... five or six? Laptops, tablets, phones...

Agent: Got it. And have you been experiencing buffering or lag specifically during those peak times?

Customer: Exactly, yeah. Netflix keeps buffering, the Zoom calls freeze up... it's frustrating.

Agent: I totally understand. So we actually have a couple of great options for you. We offer Fiber 300, which is three times your current speed, and then we also have Fiber 500 and Fiber 1 Gig for the most demanding users. (pause) Given what you've described, I'd probably recommend starting with the Fiber 300. That should handle multiple video calls and streaming pretty comfortably.

Customer: Okay, so what's the price difference? I'm on... I think it's like $60 a month right now?

Agent: Let me check your current rate here. (typing sounds) Yes, you're at $59.99 for the Fiber 100. So for Fiber 300, we can get you set up at $79.99 a month for the first year, and then it goes to $99.99 after that.

Customer: Hmm, so like twenty bucks more a month to start?

Agent: That's right. But you'd be getting three times the speed, which honestly should solve most of your issues. Plus, we're actually running a promotion right now where if you commit to a two-year term, we can knock $10 off that monthly rate for the entire two years.

Customer: Oh really? So that'd be $69.99 then?

Agent: Exactly. For the first year it'd be $69.99, and then $89.99 after that. And just so you know, there are no additional installation fees since you're already an existing fiber customer. We'd just need to update your modem, but that's a simple swap.

Customer: That's... that's actually pretty reasonable. Do I have to do anything on my end?

Agent: Nope, we'll handle it all. We can get a technician out there... (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. How does next Thursday afternoon work for you?

Customer: Next Thursday? Let me think... Yeah, that should be fine. Between like 2 and 6 PM?

Agent: Perfect. I've got a window from 2 to 6 PM on Thursday, the 14th. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's good.

Agent: Great! And just to confirm everything—we're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300 on a two-year term. That's $69.99 per month for the first twelve months, then $89.99 after that. No installation fee. And a technician will be out Thursday between 2 and 6.

Customer: Yep, that all sounds good. When does it take effect?

Agent: It'll be effective as of next Thursday when the tech comes out and installs the new modem. You should see the faster speeds right away once they're done.

Customer: Awesome. And uh, what about my current modem? Do I give it back to them?

Agent: Yeah, the technician will swap it out and take the old one with them, so you don't have to worry about that.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: (pause) Just make sure you restart your router once the new modem is in place, and give it a few minutes to fully boot up. But the tech will walk you through all that. Oh, and you should see an email confirmation of this upgrade within the next hour or so, just for your records.

Customer: Great, thanks so much for your help!

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, I think we're all set. Thanks again.

Agent: Perfect! Thanks for choosing Frontier Communications, and enjoy that faster internet. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye!

Agent: Bye now!
