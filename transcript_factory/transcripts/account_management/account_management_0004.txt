# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with your service, but I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: That's great to hear you've been happy with us! I'd be glad to help you explore some upgrade options. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our 300 megabit plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've been using it mostly for streaming and stuff, but lately with my wife working from home now, we've got multiple video calls happening at the same time, and it just... it buffers a lot. It's been frustrating.

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally understand. Multi-user households can definitely put a strain on that bandwidth. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking at? We've got some great options that could really help with that situation.

Customer: I'm not sure, to be honest. What would you recommend? I mean, I don't want to overpay, but I need something that'll handle it.

Agent: Okay, so for a household with multiple video calls and streaming, I'd recommend looking at either our 500 meg plan or... actually, you know what, have you ever considered our gigabit fiber service? We just expanded it to your area about six months ago.

Customer: A gig? That seems like overkill, doesn't it?

Agent: It sounds like it, but honestly, with the way things are going, it's becoming more of a standard. Plus, the good news is our pricing is really competitive right now. We're actually running a promotion. For the first year, you'd be looking at... (typing sounds) let me see here... $79.99 a month for gigabit service, and then it goes to $99.99 after that. Compare that to the 500 meg plan at $64.99, and honestly, for just fifteen bucks more, you're getting way more future-proof internet.

Customer: (pause) Hmm, okay. And that gigabit service, that's fiber?

Agent: Yes, exactly. It's our fiber optic service, which is why we can deliver those speeds. Plus, you'd also get a free equipment upgrade—we'd send you our latest router at no charge.

Customer: That's not bad. What about installation? Do I have to have someone come out?

Agent: So here's the thing—since you're already an existing customer with our service, and we've got fiber to your location already, it's actually just a modem swap. One of our technicians would come out, and it usually takes about an hour. The service call would be waived as part of the promotion.

Customer: Oh, that's convenient. (pause) And the price I mentioned, that's locked in for the year, right?

Agent: Correct. The $79.99 is locked in for the first 12 months. After that, it does go to the regular price of $99.99, but you'd have the option to... you know, see if there are other promotions available at that time. We do try to take care of our long-standing customers.

Customer: Alright, I think I'm interested. But before I commit, is there anything else I should know? Any equipment fees or hidden charges or anything?

Agent: (pause) Good question. So the modem is free with the promotion. There's no equipment fee. Your installation is waived. The only thing to note is that your current plan would be discontinued, so you'd lose that price point, obviously, but that's the trade-off. And just to confirm, your billing date is on the 15th, so if we schedule this for early next week, your first bill at the new rate would be prorated for the remainder of this cycle and then full price starting next month.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, let's do it.

Agent: Awesome! (typing sounds) All right, so I'm going to go ahead and process this upgrade for you. Let me just confirm a couple of details. Your service address is 427 Oakwood Drive, Apartment 3B, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And the best number to reach you at for scheduling the technician visit is this number you're calling from?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: Great. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so your upgrade is all set. I'm showing here that I can get a technician out to you on Tuesday, January 16th, between 1 and 4 p.m. Does that window work for you?

Customer: Tuesday... yeah, that should be fine. I'll be home.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I've scheduled that for you. You're all confirmed. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes, and you'll also get a reminder text the day before the appointment.

Customer: Great. And just to be clear, I should expect my speeds to be significantly faster, right?

Agent: (chuckles) Oh absolutely. Going from 300 megs to a full gig is a huge jump. Your wife's video calls should be crystal clear, and you won't have any of that buffering you mentioned when you're streaming. Honestly, you might notice the difference immediately.

Customer: That's what I like to hear. (pause) Thank you so much, Marcus. I appreciate the help.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you for being such a loyal Frontier customer. If you have any questions before Tuesday, feel free to give us a call back. And welcome to gigabit internet!

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: You take care!
