Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. Um, I'm calling because I've been with you guys for like, three years now, and my internet has been pretty good, but I'm thinking about upgrading. My current plan is 100 meg, I think?

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Oh, yeah, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Okay, I'm looking at your account now. You're right—you're currently on our 100 Mbps plan. How long have you had that?

Customer: Um, I want to say almost three years. We moved into this place and signed up pretty much right away. It's been solid, honestly, but my daughter just moved back home, and now we've got three people streaming at the same time and it's just... it's getting slower, you know?

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. Yeah, multiple users can definitely eat up that bandwidth fast, especially with streaming. What kind of activities are you all doing when it slows down? Gaming, video streaming...?

Customer: Yeah, mostly Netflix and stuff like that. My son games a little bit too. And I work from home a couple days a week, so I'm doing Zoom calls. I don't know, it just feels like it's getting bogged down.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so you've got some good news. We actually just released some new plans in your area. Your current plan is 100 Mbps, but we can upgrade you to either our 300 Mbps plan or our new Gig plan—that's 1 gigabit per second. Either would be a huge step up for what you're describing.

Customer: Okay... so what's the difference between those two? I don't really... I'm not super tech-savvy, so...

Agent: (chuckling) No, that's a fair question. So the 300 Mbps plan would definitely handle three people streaming at once without any issues. That's like, three times what you have now. The Gig plan is our top tier—that's 1000 Mbps. It's really overkill for most people, but if you think you might want something for the future, or if you want like, zero lag whatsoever, that's the way to go.

Customer: How much more is the Gig plan compared to the 300?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so right now, your 100 Mbps plan is $59.99 a month. The 300 Mbps plan is $79.99, and the Gig plan is $99.99. But because you're an existing customer with three years of service, I can actually offer you some incentives. (pause) I can do the 300 plan for $69.99 for the first year.

Customer: Oh, wow. Okay. And what about the Gig?

Agent: For the Gig plan, I could get you that for $89.99 for the first year, and then it goes to the regular price after that. But honestly, for your situation—three people streaming—the 300 should be more than enough.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, but the Gig is only like twenty bucks more, right? So if I'm gonna do this, maybe I should just go all the way?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, that's... that's actually not a bad point. It's a good value, and you'd never have to worry about speed again. Plus, you know, as your family's needs change, you've got plenty of headroom.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Let's do the Gig plan then. That sounds good.

Agent: Excellent! I think that's a smart choice. Now, I just want to make sure—you're in a serviceable area for our Gigabit service, and it looks like you are, so that's great. (pause) The installation will be pretty straightforward. We'll just need to potentially upgrade your equipment. You might need a new modem and router, depending on what you currently have.

Customer: Will that cost extra?

Agent: Great question. (typing sounds) Okay, so normally there's a one-time equipment fee of $99.99, but I can waive that for you as an existing customer. We'll send out a technician to install everything at no charge as well.

Customer: Oh, nice! When could they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. How does this Thursday or Friday look for you?

Customer: Um, this Thursday is better. What time do they usually come?

Agent: We can do either a morning window, that's 8 AM to 12 PM, or an afternoon window, 12 PM to 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: I think the afternoon would be better, actually. I work from home Thursday mornings.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm scheduling you for this Thursday, 12 PM to 5 PM window. The technician will call you about an hour before they arrive. Is the number I'm looking at still your best contact number?

Customer: Yeah, that's good. Um, and this will start on Thursday, right? Like, my service switches over then?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Your service will be activated Thursday once the technician leaves. But just to set expectations—you'll be without internet for maybe 30 to 45 minutes during the installation. They'll get you all set up and test everything before they leave, so you should be good to go after that.

Customer: Okay, great. And just to confirm—the price is $89.99 a month for the first year?

Agent: (pause) That's correct. $89.99 for the first year, and then it goes to the standard rate of $99.99 per month after that. You'll have the option to cancel or modify your plan anytime after the first year. We do offer auto-pay, which gives you an additional $5 off per month if you'd like to set that up.

Customer: Oh, really? Yeah, I mean, I could do that. Is that automatic from my account?

Agent: Yep, it's super easy. We can set that up right now if you'd like, or you can call back and do it anytime. It just deducts from your bank account or card on your billing date each month.

Customer: Yeah, let's do it. I like that better anyway.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your payment information. I've got your account on file ending in 2847—is that still current?

Customer: Um, let me think... no, actually, I got a new card last year. Do I need to update that?

Agent: We can do that right now, actually. Do you have your new card handy?

Customer: Yeah, one second. (pause) Okay, I've got it.

Agent: Awesome. Can I get the card number?

Customer: (background noise of card rustling) 4532... 1847... 9203... 5641. And the expiration is... 08/26.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. (typing sounds) Okay, all updated. So to recap: You're upgrading to our Gigabit plan at $89.99 a month for the first year. Auto-pay is enabled, so you'll save that additional $5 monthly. Installation is this Thursday from 12 PM to 5 PM, and the equipment fee is waived. Does that all sound right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds great. I'm really excited about this, actually. I've been frustrated with the speed, so hopefully this helps.

Agent: I'm confident it will. You're going to see a massive difference. (chuckling) Like, night and day. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you so much!

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer. The technician will call you Thursday, and if you have any questions before then, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too!

Agent: Bye now!
