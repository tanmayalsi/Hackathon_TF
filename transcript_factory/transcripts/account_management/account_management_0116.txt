Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. My plan right now is like, I don't know, 100 megabits or something? And I'm working from home now and it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I completely understand. Working from home definitely requires a solid connection. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, got it here. So I'm seeing you're on our Fiber 100 plan, been with us for about two years now. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right. How much faster can we go?

Agent: Great question. So with our fiber network in your area, we can actually get you up to speeds of 500 megabits per second, or even our gigabit plan at 1,000 megabits per second. Those would be huge upgrades from where you are now. What kind of activities are you doing that need more speed? That'll help me recommend the best option for you.

Customer: Um, mostly video conferencing, and I download a lot of files for work. There's usually like three or four people on Zoom calls at the same time in my house too, so...

Agent: Okay, yeah, so with multiple video conferences and file transfers happening simultaneously, I'd definitely recommend at least our Fiber 500 plan. That'll give you plenty of headroom. The gigabit is awesome if you want future-proofing, but honestly, 500 megs should handle all of that without any issues.

Customer: What's the price difference? My bill's already like... I think it's around 65 a month right now?

Agent: (typing sounds) So your current plan is actually $59.99 a month. Our Fiber 500 plan would be $79.99 per month. And if you wanted to jump to the gigabit, that's $99.99 per month. (pause) Now, the good news is we have a promotion running right now. If you sign up for a 12-month agreement, we can lock in the Fiber 500 at $69.99 per month for the first year.

Customer: Oh, that's not too bad actually. Um... (trailing off) Is there any installation fee or anything like that?

Agent: Good question. Since you're already a fiber customer at your address, this is actually a pretty straightforward upgrade. We can waive the installation fee, and honestly, depending on your equipment, we might not even need to send a technician out. I can check that for you.

Customer: Oh nice, so I could like, self-install?

Agent: Possibly, yeah. Our service area shows that your address is fiber-ready, so when we process this upgrade, we can ship you a new modem and router combo, and you'd just swap it out yourself. Takes maybe ten minutes. If for some reason it doesn't work or you're not comfortable doing it, we can always schedule a tech visit at no charge.

Customer: That would be perfect, honestly. I'd rather not have someone come out if I don't have to. So if I do the 12-month thing at 69.99, when would that rate go up?

Agent: So after the 12 months, the regular rate for Fiber 500 would be $79.99 per month, but we can revisit that closer to the end of your contract. (pause) We usually have other promotions available for existing customers. Is there anything else I should know? Any TV or phone services you're interested in bundling?

Customer: No, just the internet. I stream everything anyway. (chuckles)

Agent: (laughs) Fair enough. So let me recap what we're setting up here. We're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500, locked in at $69.99 per month for 12 months. We're waiving the installation fee and sending you a self-install kit. We should be able to get that shipped out to you within 2 to 3 business days, and your service upgrade would be active as soon as you plug everything in.

Customer: Sounds good. How do I... do I need to do anything else or...?

Agent: (typing sounds) Not really. I'm going to process this upgrade for you right now. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour or so with all the details. And then you'll get an email from our shipping partner when your equipment is on the way. Is the email we have on file still good? It looks like [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. (pause, more typing) Okay, so the upgrade is officially in the system. You're all set. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for the quick turnaround, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure! Thank you for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being such a loyal customer. Enjoy that faster internet, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions once your equipment arrives.

Customer: Will do. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Thanks for calling Frontier!
