Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, I'm currently on your 300 megabit plan and I'm thinking about upgrading. My work has me doing a lot more video conferencing lately, and honestly, the internet's been feeling a little sluggish.

Agent: I completely understand. Video conferencing can definitely put a strain on your bandwidth. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I've got you. I'm seeing you're currently on our Gigabit 300 plan at $79.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: Great. And just to confirm, this is service at... (pause) ...3847 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's the one.

Agent: Excellent. So you mentioned the connection feels sluggish with your video conferencing. Are you experiencing issues like drops, buffering, or is it more just general slowness?

Customer: Mostly just... it's not terrible, but like, sometimes when I'm on a Zoom call and my wife's streaming something in the other room, things get choppy. And we've got a couple of smart home devices now too, so it's all adding up, I guess.

Agent: Mmm-hmm, yeah, that's actually really common. Multiple video streams plus all those connected devices can definitely max out a 300 meg connection pretty quickly. So what I'd recommend is our Gigabit 500 plan. That's going to give you plenty of headroom for all of that.

Customer: Okay, and what's that going to run me?

Agent: (typing sounds) So the Gigabit 500 plan is $99.99 per month. That's a $20 increase from what you're paying now, but you're essentially doubling your speed. We also have a Gigabit 1 Gig plan, which maxes out at one gigabit per second. That's $129.99 a month.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) What's the difference between the 500 and the full gig? Like, would I really notice it?

Agent: That's a great question. Honestly, for your use case—video conferencing, streaming, smart home devices—the 500 meg plan would probably be more than sufficient. The 1 gig plan is really more for households with, like, heavy usage, multiple gamers, that kind of thing. But if you think you might need it down the road, or if you just want that extra cushion, it's definitely an option.

Customer: What about... are there any deals or anything? Like, I've been a customer for a while now.

Agent: (pause) Let me check what we have available for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so you've been with us for... looks like three and a half years. That's fantastic. Unfortunately, I'm not seeing any promotional pricing available on upgrades at the moment, but what I can do is waive the upgrade fee for you, which would normally be $99.

Customer: Oh, that's... okay, that helps a little. So no promotional discount though?

Agent: Not on the upgrade itself, but that waived fee does save you a hundred bucks right there. And of course, your service would start immediately. There's no wait time.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I think... I think the 500 meg plan makes sense. Let's go with that one.

Agent: Perfect choice. I think you're going to be really happy with the improvement. So just to recap what we're doing here—we're upgrading you from Gigabit 300 to Gigabit 500. Your new rate will be $99.99 per month, and I'm waiving the $99 upgrade fee. The upgrade can typically be done remotely, so you shouldn't need a technician to come out. We just need to push it through to your modem, and it should take effect within the next 24 to 48 hours.

Customer: Oh, I don't need anyone to come out? That's good.

Agent: Right, exactly. We can handle it all remotely. However... (pause) ...let me just make a note here. Your modem is the Actiontec model, which is pretty outdated at this point. It can technically handle the 500 meg speeds, but to get the full benefit, you might want to consider a newer modem down the road. It won't affect your service, but just something to keep in mind.

Customer: Okay, noted. So is there anything else I need to do on my end?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. Just keep the modem powered on, and you should see the speed increase kick in within a day or two. You can run a speed test on your phone or computer if you want to confirm once it goes live. And if you have any issues, you can always reach back out to us.

Customer: Sounds good. When does this become active?

Agent: (typing sounds) So I'm processing this right now, and you should see the change reflected on your next billing cycle, which is... (pause) ...March 15th. The rate change will be effective then, and the speed upgrade should roll out in the next 24 to 48 hours. You might actually see the speed increase before the billing date.

Customer: Perfect.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for all your help, Derek.

Agent: My pleasure. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and thank you for being such a loyal customer. You should receive a confirmation email within a few minutes with all these details. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks again.

Agent: Take care!
