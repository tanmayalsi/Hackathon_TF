Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, I've had your service for about three years now, and I'm pretty happy with it, but I'm thinking I might need to upgrade. My internet's been feeling a little slow lately.

Agent: Oh, great! I'm glad you've been a satisfied customer. I'd be happy to help you explore upgrade options. Can I start by getting your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... let me find that real quick. (pause) Okay, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for an address in Portland, Oregon?

Customer: Yes, that's right. On Hawthorne Boulevard.

Agent: Excellent. Okay, so I'm pulling up your account here. I see you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. A hundred megabits, I think?

Agent: Yes, exactly. One hundred megabits download speed. And you mentioned things are feeling a little slow?

Customer: Well, honestly, I work from home now—I didn't when I signed up—and I'm doing a lot of video calls. Zoom meetings, that kind of thing. Plus my roommate is always streaming stuff, and I think we're just... I don't know, maxing it out or something. I keep getting buffering.

Agent: Ah, yeah, that makes total sense. So with multiple people using the connection for streaming and video conferencing, a hundred megs can definitely get tight. The good news is we have some really solid upgrade options that would handle that way better. (pause) Let me ask you a few quick questions. Are you interested in just higher speeds, or would you also be open to a promotional bundle?

Customer: Um, well, what kind of bundle?

Agent: So we have some great current offers where you can add TV service and get a discount on both. Or if you just want to focus on the internet speed, that's totally fine too.

Customer: Hmm, I don't really watch traditional TV much, to be honest. I'm more of a streaming person. So I think just internet.

Agent: Totally understand. That's super common now. Okay, so for internet-only, our next tier up would be our Fiber 300 plan. That's three hundred megabits download. With your roommate streaming and your video calls, that would give you plenty of headroom. We actually have a current promotion where we can get you that for $79.99 a month for the first twelve months.

Customer: Okay, so that's up from...?

Agent: You're currently at $89.99 for the Fiber 100, so actually your first year would be ten dollars cheaper, and then after the promotional period, it would go to regular pricing.

Customer: Oh, wait, really? That's not what I expected. (laughs) That's great. What's the regular pricing after the year?

Agent: (typing sounds) After the first twelve months, it would be $99.99 per month for the Fiber 300.

Customer: So I'd be paying more after the year than I am now?

Agent: You would be, yes. Ten dollars more per month after the promotional period ends. But you'd be tripling your speed, so it's a significant improvement in performance.

Customer: Yeah, I hear you. Do you have anything faster than three hundred?

Agent: We do! We have Fiber 500, which is half a gigabit, and we also have our Fiber Gig plan, which is one full gigabit.

Customer: (whistles) Okay, that's... that's pretty fast. What would those cost?

Agent: For Fiber 500, we can get you that at $99.99 for the first twelve months, and then regular pricing is $119.99 after that. And for the Gig plan, which is really our premium option, that's $129.99 for the first year and $149.99 after.

Customer: Wow. (pause) That's... that's a pretty big jump. For the gig plan, I mean. Do I really need that? Honestly?

Agent: That's a fair question. For what you described—video conferencing, streaming, a roommate also streaming—Fiber 300 would honestly handle that very comfortably. The Gig plan is more for like, heavy online gamers, or if you're running a home business with multiple people uploading large files constantly, that kind of thing. But for your situation, I'd probably recommend the 300.

Customer: Okay, yeah. That makes sense. So the 300 at seventy-nine ninety-nine for the first year sounds pretty good then. What do I need to do to make that happen?

Agent: Perfect! So I can set that up for you right now. (typing sounds) Just to give you a quick heads up, there's no installation fee for this upgrade since you're already an existing customer with Fiber to your address. We can push the new speed to your modem remotely, and it should take effect tonight after midnight.

Customer: Oh, cool! So I don't have to do anything? It just... happens?

Agent: Exactly. You don't need to restart anything or anything like that. It's all done on our end. Though, if you want, you could restart your modem after midnight just to make sure everything's running smoothly, but it's not necessary.

Customer: Awesome. And just to confirm, the promotional price is locked in for twelve months?

Agent: Yes, $79.99 per month for twelve months. After that, if you want to keep the Fiber 300, it'll be $99.99. Of course, we can always talk about options when that comes up—sometimes we have new promotions available.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I'm good with that. Let's do it.

Agent: Excellent! I'm going to process this upgrade for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm showing here that your new Fiber 300 plan is active as of today. Your first billing cycle with the new rate will appear on your next bill. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. This was easy, actually. I thought it'd be more of a hassle.

Agent: (laughs) I'm glad it was smooth! That's what we like to hear. Just so you have it for your records, I'm going to email you a confirmation of this upgrade with all the details. You should receive that within the next few minutes. Is the email address on file still good?

Customer: Yeah, it should be. I think it's [inaudible]... actually, wait, I changed my email a few months back. Let me give you the new one.

Agent: Oh, good catch. Yeah, let me update that for you.

Customer: It's A-M-Y, dot, Richardson... R-I-C-H-A-R-D-S-O-N, 1987 at Gmail.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. Amy Richardson 1987. Perfect. I'll get that confirmation sent right over. And Amy, just thank you so much for being a loyal Frontier customer. We really appreciate it, and I hope you enjoy the upgraded speed!

Customer: Thank you, Marcus. I appreciate your help.

Agent: Absolutely. You have a great day, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye!
