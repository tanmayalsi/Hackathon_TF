Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek. Yeah, so I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. I see you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it was fine for a while, but now I'm working from home full-time, and my wife streams a lot. We're both online constantly, and the speed just isn't there anymore. Plus, we've got like three or four devices going at any given time.

Agent: Okay, I completely understand. That's actually a really common situation we hear about. The good news is, with Fiber, we have some excellent options to upgrade. So the 100 megabits per second that you have now, we can bump you up to either our Fiber 300 plan or our Fiber 500 plan. The 300 would be great for what you're describing, but the 500 is really built for heavy usage like streaming and working from home simultaneously.

Customer: What's the price difference? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: (pause) Understandable. So your current plan is $69.99 a month, right?

Customer: Yeah, sounds about right.

Agent: The Fiber 300 would be $89.99 per month, so that's an additional $20. The Fiber 500 would be $129.99, which is $60 more than what you're paying now. But here's the thing—I actually have a promotion running through the end of the month where if you upgrade to either of those plans, I can waive your installation fee, which would normally be $99.

Customer: Oh, that's... that's actually helpful. So what's the real difference between the 300 and the 500? Like, would the 300 handle what I'm doing?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great question. So with Fiber 300, you're looking at download speeds up to 300 megabits per second, upload up to 10 megabits. That should handle multiple video calls, streaming, and general browsing without too many issues. The Fiber 500 gives you 500 down and 20 up, so significantly faster uploads, which can be beneficial if you're doing video conferencing or uploading files for work.

Customer: Hmm. Do you do any discounts if I commit to a longer contract or something?

Agent: That's a good thought. Unfortunately, our Fiber plans are month-to-month with no long-term contracts required. But the promotion I mentioned—the waived installation fee—that's the biggest savings I can offer you right now. It's a pretty solid deal.

Customer: (pause) You know what, I think I'm going to go with the 300. The 500 seems like overkill for what we need, and I don't want to spend that much more if I don't have to.

Agent: Excellent choice! That's actually what I would recommend for your situation. So I'm going to upgrade you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300. Your new rate will be $89.99 per month, and the installation fee is waived. The installation should take about... (typing sounds) ...two to three hours, and we can schedule a technician to come out. What does your availability look like?

Customer: When's the soonest you can get someone out here?

Agent: Let me check our scheduling system. (pause) Looks like we have availability tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we have a couple of slots next week—Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.

Customer: Tomorrow morning works better for me. Let's do tomorrow between 8 and noon.

Agent: Perfect! So I have you scheduled for tomorrow, 8 AM to noon. The technician will come out and upgrade your modem to support the higher speeds, and we'll get you all set up. Is the address we have on file still 1247 Maple Street, Apt. 3B?

Customer: Yeah, that's still correct.

Agent: Great. And just so you know, your new plan will take effect tomorrow. You might not see the full speeds until after the technician leaves, but definitely by the end of the day tomorrow you should be experiencing the upgrade.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. Do I need to do anything before the technician arrives?

Agent: Nope, just make sure someone's home to let them in. They'll have all the equipment they need. Oh, and one more thing—your service will be interrupted for a brief period during the installation, probably no more than 15 or 20 minutes, so just keep that in mind.

Customer: Got it. And I'll get a confirmation email or something?

Agent: Absolutely. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes, and we'll also send you a courtesy reminder tomorrow morning with the technician's phone number in case they need to reach you.

Customer: Perfect. Hey Derek, thanks for making this painless. I appreciate it.

Agent: (warmly) You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help. Just to recap, you're all set for tomorrow morning, 8 to noon, for your upgrade to Fiber 300. If you have any questions before then, feel free to give us a call back anytime.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we hope you enjoy those faster speeds!

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
