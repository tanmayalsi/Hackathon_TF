Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I'm currently on the 100 meg plan, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore. I work from home now and my wife streams a lot, so we're constantly dealing with lag and buffering. I'd like to upgrade.

Agent: I totally understand. Working from home definitely changes your internet needs. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, got it. So I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years on our Gigabit Fiber service in the 100 meg tier. That's great. And you're interested in upgrading to a faster speed?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. What options do I have?

Agent: Awesome. So we have a few great options for you. You could move up to our 300 meg plan, which would be fantastic for what you're describing—multiple users, streaming, working from home. Or if you really want to future-proof yourself, we have our 500 meg plan, and then of course our Gig internet, which is one gigabit per second.

Customer: What's the price difference? I'm on 100 meg right now, so what would I be paying?

Agent: (pause) Great question. Let me just check your current pricing. (typing) So you're currently at $59.99 a month for the 100 meg plan. If you upgrade to 300 meg, that would be $79.99 a month. The 500 meg tier is $99.99, and our full gigabit plan is $119.99 per month.

Customer: Hmm, okay. And that's for how long? Is there like an introductory rate or something?

Agent: That's a great question. Those prices would be locked in for the first twelve months, and then after that, it would go to our regular pricing. But I have to say, we've got a promotion running right now where if you upgrade today, I can actually add an extra three months at that promotional rate. So you'd get fifteen months total at that locked-in price.

Customer: Oh, really? That's... that's actually not bad. Um, let me think. I think the 300 meg would probably be good for us. We don't need the full gig, you know?

Agent: That's a solid choice. The 300 meg plan is really popular with customers in your situation. You'll definitely notice the difference, especially with multiple devices and streaming. (pause) Actually, I'm also showing that I can waive the installation fee for you as well, since you're already a loyal customer upgrading your service. That's normally $99.99, so that's another nice savings.

Customer: Wait, really? That's awesome. Yeah, okay, let's do it. Let's do the 300 meg plan.

Agent: Perfect! Let me just confirm a few things with you here. (typing) So we're upgrading you from 100 meg to 300 meg Fiber internet. That's $79.99 a month for the first fifteen months, and then it goes to our standard rate after that. We're waiving the installation fee, and your service address is still 4521 Maple Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Excellent. And just to let you know, we can schedule a technician to come out and upgrade your equipment. When would be a good time for you? We have availability next Tuesday between 8 AM and 12 PM, or Wednesday afternoon after 1 PM?

Customer: Tuesday morning works. I'll be home then.

Agent: (typing) Great, I've got you down for next Tuesday between 8 and noon. The technician should be there sometime in that window. You'll get a call about an hour before they arrive. They'll swap out your gateway and make sure everything's optimized for the 300 meg speeds. The whole thing should take about thirty to forty-five minutes.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. Uh, will I experience any downtime during that?

Agent: There will be a brief outage while we're making the switch—probably just five or ten minutes—but nothing significant. You might want to let your wife know in case she's streaming or anything. (pause) Um, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks so much, this was really helpful.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You should see a significant improvement once that upgrade goes live. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too!

Agent: Bye now!
