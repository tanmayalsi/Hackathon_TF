# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with your service, but I'm thinking I might need to upgrade. My internet's been feeling a little slow lately.

Agent: Oh, great! I'm glad to hear you've been happy with us. I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this still for the address on Maple Street in Springfield?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Awesome. So I'm looking here at your account, and you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 300 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. I'm not totally sure of the exact name, but it's 300 megabits, I believe.

Agent: That's the one. So you're getting 300 down, 300 up with that package. What's been going on that's making it feel slower? Have you noticed any issues during specific times of day, or is it pretty consistent?

Customer: Well, I've been working from home more lately, and my wife, she's been doing some online classes. So we both have multiple devices connected at the same time. I think that might be part of it. We've got laptops, phones, a smart TV... you know, the usual stuff nowadays. And when we're both streaming or video conferencing, things just seem to lag a bit.

Agent: Okay, that makes total sense. With multiple high-bandwidth activities happening simultaneously, 300 meg can definitely start to feel the pinch. So let me tell you what we have available in your area. (pause) We offer the Frontier Fiber 500 plan, which would give you 500 down and 500 up. That's a nice step up. And then we also have our Frontier Fiber 1-Gig plan, which is our premium offering—that's 1,000 down, 1,000 up.

Customer: Wow, okay. (pause) What's the price difference? I mean, the 1-Gig sounds great, but I'm kind of price-conscious.

Agent: Understandable, absolutely. So right now, your current plan is, let me see here... (typing sounds) you're at $79.99 a month. The Fiber 500 would be $99.99 a month, so that's a twenty-dollar increase. And the Fiber 1-Gig is $149.99, so that would be seventy dollars more.

Customer: Hmm, okay. And would I get any kind of promotional pricing or anything?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me check what we have available for existing customers. (pause) So actually, we do have a promotion running right now. If you upgrade to the Fiber 500, we can get you in at $89.99 for the first twelve months. After that, it would go to the regular $99.99. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh, that's better. So that's only ten dollars more for the first year?

Agent: Exactly. Ten dollars more for the first year, and then it's twenty after that. And honestly, for two people working and studying from home with multiple devices, I think the 500 is going to make a really noticeable difference for you.

Customer: Yeah, I think so too. What about the 1-Gig? Do you have any deals on that?

Agent: Let me see. (typing sounds) (pause) For the 1-Gig, I don't have a current promotional rate, but I can note here that you're interested, and you'd qualify for... actually, you know what, let me get my supervisor to see if we can do something special for a loyal three-year customer like yourself. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, then resumes) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I was able to get approval for a special offer on the 1-Gig. We can do $129.99 for the first twelve months instead of the regular $149.99. That's twenty dollars off.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. So that's actually pretty competitive. Let me think about this for a second... (pause) You know what, I think I want to go with the 1-Gig. My wife and I are both going to be home for a while, and having that extra speed will probably be worth it.

Agent: That's a fantastic choice. I think you're going to be really happy with that upgrade. (typing sounds) So let me set that up for you. The Frontier Fiber 1-Gig plan at $129.99 for the first twelve months. Just to confirm, you'd like to keep everything else the same, right? Same billing address, same phone number on file?

Customer: Yeah, that all sounds good.

Agent: Perfect. And when would you like to have this upgrade take effect? We can schedule a technician to come out and upgrade your equipment, or if you're comfortable with it, we can do a self-install kit.

Customer: How long would the technician take? I don't want to wait too long.

Agent: That's fair. We have availability... (typing sounds) we have an opening tomorrow between 8 AM and noon, or we could do Thursday afternoon, 2 to 6 PM. What works better for your schedule?

Customer: Tomorrow morning would be perfect, actually.

Agent: Excellent. Let me get you scheduled for that. (pause) Okay, so we've got you down for tomorrow, January 16th, between 8 AM and noon. A technician will come to upgrade your modem and router to be compatible with the 1-Gig speeds. You should receive a confirmation text and email within the next few minutes with all the details.

Customer: Great, thank you. And just to confirm one more time, my rate is locked in at $129.99 for the first year?

Agent: That's correct. Locked in for twelve months from tomorrow when the service goes live. After that, it'll be $149.99 per month, but you can always call us back before then if you want to discuss other options. Plus, with the higher speeds, if you ever need more than what we offer, we can always talk about upgrading further—though I don't think you'll need to anytime soon. (laughs)

Customer: (laughs) Okay, I think that covers everything. I really appreciate your help, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure! I'm really glad we could get you set up with the speeds you need. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you so much for being a valued Frontier customer, and we'll see you tomorrow morning. If you have any questions before then, feel free to give us a call back. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!

Customer: Bye!
