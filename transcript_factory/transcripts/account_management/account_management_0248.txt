Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm really happy with your service, but I'm wondering if there's a way to upgrade my internet speed. I've been working from home more lately and my current plan just doesn't seem to cut it anymore.

Agent: Great, I'm glad to hear you've had a good experience with us! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, and just to verify, is this for the account under the name Michael Torres?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Excellent, Michael. Okay, so I'm looking at your current plan here. You're on our Fiber 100 plan, which gives you 100 Mbps download speeds. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's what I thought. Honestly, when I'm on video calls with multiple people and someone's downloading something, things get a little choppy. My kids are also doing online school stuff, so we've got a lot going on.

Agent: I totally understand. With multiple devices and video conferencing, that can definitely add up. We actually have some great options available in your area. Let me tell you what we can do. (pause) We have Fiber 200, which doubles your speed to 200 Mbps, and we also have Fiber 500 if you want to go even higher. Have you thought about what speed range would work best for your household?

Customer: Hmm, I'm not really sure. How much more would that cost me? I don't want to break the bank here.

Agent: That's a fair question. Right now, I'm looking at a special promotion we're running. For Fiber 200, we can get you set up for just $59.99 a month for the first year, and that's only a $10 increase from your current rate. After the promotional period, it would be $74.99 per month.

Customer: Okay, that's not too bad. What about the 500? Just out of curiosity.

Agent: Our Fiber 500 plan is currently $89.99 monthly with the same year-one promotion pricing. That gives you 500 Mbps, which is really ideal if you have a lot of heavy usage happening simultaneously. But honestly, for a household with work-from-home video calls and school streaming, the Fiber 200 should handle that pretty comfortably.

Customer: Yeah, I think 200 is probably more what we need. That should be enough, right?

Agent: Absolutely. 200 Mbps will give you plenty of headroom for video conferencing, streaming, and the kids' schoolwork all at once. (typing sounds) I'm going to go ahead and set that up for you. The upgrade is free to install, and we can actually get a technician out there as soon as... let me see... we have availability tomorrow afternoon between 2 and 5 PM, or we could do Thursday morning if that works better for you.

Customer: Tomorrow afternoon would be great actually. That works for me.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I've got you scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, between 2 and 5 PM. A technician will come out and make sure everything's optimized for your new speeds. You shouldn't experience any downtime, but the visit usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes.

Customer: Nice. And my bill... when does that change over?

Agent: Good question. The new rate will be reflected on your next billing cycle, which looks like it'll be on the 15th of next month. So you'll have one more month at your current rate, and then the new promotional rate kicks in. You'll receive a confirmation email with all the details and your service appointment confirmation within the next hour or so.

Customer: Great, that's really helpful. Um, one more thing—is there anything else I should know? Any equipment changes or...?

Agent: (pause) Nope, you're all set. Your current modem is compatible with the higher speeds, so no equipment swap necessary. You'll just start seeing the faster speeds immediately after the technician completes the upgrade tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks a lot, Derek. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael! Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You're going to love that extra speed. If you have any questions before tomorrow, feel free to give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!
