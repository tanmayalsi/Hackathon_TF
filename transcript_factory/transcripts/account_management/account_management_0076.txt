Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've got the basic plan right now and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, this is Marcus Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Marcus. So you're looking to upgrade your current service. Let me pull up what you're on right now. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I mean, it was fine when I first got it, but now with my daughter doing her schooling online and my wife working from home, we're constantly running into issues. Like, things are buffering, downloads are taking forever...

Agent: I completely understand. With multiple people using the internet simultaneously, you definitely need more bandwidth. So what kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you interested in something like our Fiber 300 or maybe even our Fiber 500 plan?

Customer: What's the difference between those two? I don't really know what all those numbers mean, to be honest.

Agent: No problem at all. So the numbers represent megabits per second, or Mbps. Your current plan is 100 Mbps. Our Fiber 300 gives you 300 Mbps, and our Fiber 500 gives you 500 Mbps. With multiple users streaming, video conferencing, and doing schoolwork online, I'd probably recommend the 300 plan as a good middle ground. It's a huge jump from what you have now.

Customer: And that'll stop the buffering and all that?

Agent: It should significantly reduce those issues, yes. With 300 Mbps, multiple people can stream in 4K, video conference, and do downloads all at the same time without impacting each other.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. What's the pricing on that?

Agent: (typing sounds) So our Fiber 300 plan is $79.99 per month for the first year as a promotional rate, and then it goes to our standard rate of $99.99 per month after that. Your current plan is $49.99, so that's an increase of about $30 a month during the promotional period.

Customer: Hmm, thirty bucks... (pause) Is that the best you can do? I mean, I've been a customer for what, like five years now?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me see what other promotions or loyalty offers we might have available. (typing sounds, longer pause) Okay, so because you've been with us for over four years, I can offer you an extended promotional period. I can get you the Fiber 300 for $74.99 per month for the first eighteen months instead of just twelve. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh, that's better. And after eighteen months it goes to the hundred?

Agent: Right, after the promotional period ends, it would be $99.99 per month, yes. But we can definitely revisit your options at that time. We often have new promotions coming up.

Customer: Okay, I think that works for me. When can you get that switched over?

Agent: Great! So since you're in a Fiber service area, we don't need to send a technician out. The upgrade can happen over the network, and you should see the improved speeds within 24 hours. Typically it's much sooner, but I always give that as the timeframe. You shouldn't experience any service interruption.

Customer: Wait, really? It's just automatic?

Agent: Yes, sir. One of the nice benefits of Fiber is that upgrades can happen remotely. You'll just restart your modem at some point, and boom, you'll have the faster speeds.

Customer: That's awesome. So I don't have to do anything on my end?

Agent: Not really, no. We'll handle it all from our end. Your modem might restart itself automatically, or you can restart it manually if you want to speed up the process. But either way, you should be good to go.

Customer: Perfect. And you said I have that discounted rate for eighteen months?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, sir. Your new rate of $74.99 per month starts immediately, and that locks in for eighteen months. I'm showing the upgrade is scheduled to process today, so you should see the change reflected in your next billing cycle.

Customer: Excellent. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Um, just one thing. We do have our Frontier mobile service if you're interested, but no pressure. I wanted to make sure I mentioned it since you're a valued customer. We can bundle that for additional savings.

Customer: No thanks, I'm good with my current phone situation.

Agent: No problem at all. Well, Marcus, I really appreciate your business, and I think you're going to be very happy with the faster speeds. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome! Thanks for calling Frontier, and enjoy that upgraded internet.

Customer: Take care.

Agent: You too. Bye now.
