Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm currently on the 100 megabit plan, but honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore. I work from home, my wife streams a lot, and we've got two kids doing school stuff online. It's getting really slow.

Agent: I completely understand. That's actually a pretty common situation we're hearing from customers these days. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got you here. So you're on our 100 meg fiber plan in the Gilbert area. And you're looking to upgrade to something faster?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. What options do you have available at my address?

Agent: Great question. Let me check the availability for you. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so at your location, we can definitely upgrade you. We've got our 400 megabit plan, which is pretty popular right now, or we also have our gigabit plan if you want to really future-proof yourself.

Customer: Wow, a gigabit? That's... that's pretty fast. What's the price difference on that?

Agent: So your current plan is $69.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, so the 400 meg plan would be $99.99 a month, and that's for the first year. After that, it goes to $119.99. The gig plan is $129.99 for the first year, then $149.99 after. But—and this is good news—we're running a promotion right now where we waive the installation fee on upgrades. That would normally be $99.

Customer: Hmm. So the gigabit is a pretty big jump. Will I actually notice a difference between 400 and a gig?

Agent: That's a fair question. Honestly, for most households, even with multiple people streaming and working from home, 400 megs is going to handle that really well. The gigabit is more if you're... I don't know, transferring huge files regularly, or if you want to really maximize for future-proofing. With two kids doing school work and streaming, you'd probably be really happy with the 400.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I think 400 would be good. That should be more than enough for us.

Agent: Perfect. I think that's the smart choice. So I'm going to go ahead and set that up for you. Just to confirm, you want to upgrade from your current 100 meg plan to the 400 meg plan at $99.99 per month for the first year?

Customer: Yes, that sounds good. When could that be installed?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have available. We've got some pretty good openings this week, actually. What does your schedule look like? We do weekday appointments between 8 AM and 5 PM, or we can do Saturday mornings.

Customer: Uh, Saturday would be better for me. How early are we talking?

Agent: We can do Saturday morning between 8 and noon. Does this Saturday work, or would you prefer the following Saturday?

Customer: This Saturday works. The sooner the better, honestly. The internet's been driving me crazy. (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) I hear you. Okay, let me lock that in for you. This Saturday, between 8 AM and noon. The technician will come out, they'll upgrade your equipment if needed, and you should be up and running that same day.

Customer: Great. Do I need to do anything to prepare or...?

Agent: Nope, not really. Just make sure someone's home to let them in. They'll handle everything else. Oh, and just so you know, there might be a brief service interruption, maybe 15, 20 minutes while they're making the switch, but it should be pretty quick.

Customer: Okay, that's fine. And just to make sure—there's no contract or anything, right?

Agent: No contract at all. You're month-to-month, and you can cancel anytime. Though obviously we hope you love the speeds and stick with us. (laughs)

Customer: (laughs) Fair enough. So what happens after the first year? Does it go up to that $119.99?

Agent: Yes, after 12 months, it'll go to $119.99 a month. But here's the thing—I'd recommend calling us back around month 11, because we often have retention offers for existing customers. So you might be able to negotiate a better rate before that increase hits.

Customer: Oh, that's good to know. Alright, so I'm all set then?

Agent: (typing sounds) Almost. Let me just get a confirmation email sent to you with all the details—your appointment time, your new plan details, everything. What's the best email for that?

Customer: It's [inaudible]@gmail.com. Is that the one you have?

Agent: Let me check. I'm seeing jlewis1988@gmail.com. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, perfect.

Agent: Great. I'm sending that now. You should get it within the next few minutes. And if you have any questions before Saturday, you can just give us a call back or reference your order number, which is going to be 7834521.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks Derek, I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome! We really appreciate your business, and we're excited to get you those faster speeds. If there's anything else I can help with today, just let me know.

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Have a great day, and we'll see you Saturday morning!

Customer: Thanks, bye!

Agent: Bye now!
