Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've got the basic 100 megabit plan right now, and it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've got some great options available. Before we get into that, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what name is this account under?

Customer: It's under James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got you here. So you're currently on our 100 Mbps plan. What's prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, streaming, or...?

Customer: Yeah, so I'm actually working from home now, and I've got my wife and two kids doing school stuff online. We're constantly getting these buffering issues, video calls are dropping... it's just a mess.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, that sounds frustrating. (pause) Okay, so with multiple devices and video conferencing, you'd definitely benefit from more bandwidth. We've got a couple of options. We can do our 300 Mbps plan, or if you really want to future-proof yourself, we've got 500 Mbps, which is our fiber gigabit service is also available in your area.

Customer: Really? The gigabit service? I didn't know that was available at my address.

Agent: Let me just double-check here. (typing sounds) Yes, you're in one of our recently upgraded areas. The gigabit service is available. So that's up to 1,000 Mbps download speeds.

Customer: Wow, that's... that's a lot faster than what I have. Is it gonna be ridiculously expensive though?

Agent: (chuckles) I get that question a lot. Actually, the pricing is pretty competitive. For the 300 Mbps plan, we're looking at $59.99 a month for the first year, then $79.99 after that. The gigabit service is $89.99 for the first year and $109.99 after.

Customer: And that's just for internet, right? I don't need TV or anything.

Agent: Yep, that's internet-only pricing. Though if you ever wanted to bundle, we do have some packages that could save you money overall. But no pressure at all.

Customer: Okay, so... honestly, for what you're describing with the gigabit service, that seems worth it. Especially if I'm gonna have multiple people on Zoom calls and streaming at the same time.

Agent: That's a smart choice. The gigabit service is really solid for that. (typing sounds) Now, I do want to mention—we would need to schedule a technician visit to upgrade your equipment and make sure everything is properly installed. Are you available anytime soon? We typically have appointments available within the next week or so.

Customer: Uh, let me think... my schedule is pretty flexible right now since I work from home. How long does that usually take?

Agent: The installation typically runs about an hour to an hour and a half, depending on if we need to run any new fiber to your location. Since you're in an area where we've already got infrastructure in place, it should be pretty straightforward.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I can do that. What day works best?

Agent: Let me pull up our calendar here. (pause) We've got availability on Thursday afternoon between 2 and 5 p.m., or Friday morning between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. What works better for you?

Customer: Friday morning is better for me. Can we do like... 10:30?

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I've got you down for Friday, December 15th at 10:30 a.m. A technician will come to your home and get you all set up with the new modem and router for the gigabit service.

Customer: Great. And just to confirm, my current bill is... I don't even know what I'm paying right now, honestly.

Agent: (typing sounds) You're currently at $49.99 a month for the 100 Mbps plan. So with the new gigabit service, you're looking at $89.99 for the first 12 months, which is a $40 increase.

Customer: Okay, I can swing that. And then it goes to $109.99 after the first year?

Agent: That's right. Though we do review promotions regularly, so there may be other offers available when your year is up. We'll definitely reach out to you before then.

Customer: Alright, sounds good. And I should be all set after the technician comes on Friday?

Agent: Exactly. Our tech will make sure everything is installed, tested, and working properly before they leave. You'll have your new equipment activated, and we'll make sure you're connected to the new network on your devices.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything I need to do to prepare or anything?

Agent: Nope, just make sure someone's home to let the technician in. (chuckles) And maybe have some WiFi-connected devices handy so they can make sure the signal is good throughout your place. They might move the router around to find the optimal spot.

Customer: Okay, I'll do that. Anything else I should know?

Agent: I think we're all set! Oh, one thing—you should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details. And if you have any questions before Friday, you can always call us back or check your account online.

Customer: Great. I really appreciate your help, Derek.

Agent: Of course, James. I'm happy to help. Thanks for choosing Frontier Communications, and we'll see you Friday morning!

Customer: Thanks, have a good day.

Agent: You too. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
