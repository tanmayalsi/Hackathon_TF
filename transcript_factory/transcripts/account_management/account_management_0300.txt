Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer with you guys for about three years now, and I'm thinking it might be time to upgrade my internet plan.

Agent: Great! I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. And your name is...?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Thank you, David. Okay, I'm seeing here that you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. And honestly, it's been pretty good, but my kids are doing remote learning now, and my wife works from home, so we've got like... a lot of devices going at once, you know? The internet's been getting a little sluggish lately.

Agent: I completely understand. Multiple video streams can definitely tax a connection. So are you experiencing buffering, or is it more about the overall speed?

Customer: Both, really. Like, when my wife's on a Zoom call and my son is watching YouTube, everything kind of slows down. And I work from home too, so when I'm transferring large files, it's just... it takes forever.

Agent: Mm-hmm, yeah, that makes sense. So with three people working or studying simultaneously, you'd definitely benefit from more bandwidth. (pause) Let me tell you about some options. We have our Fiber 300 plan, which would give you three times the speed you're currently getting. We also have Fiber 500 if you want maximum performance, and then we have our top tier, Fiber 1 Gig, which is our absolute fastest option.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference in price between what I'm paying now and like... the 300?

Agent: (typing sounds) So you're currently at $49.99 a month for your Fiber 100. Our Fiber 300 plan is $69.99 a month, so that's a twenty dollar increase. The Fiber 500 is $89.99, and the Gig is $119.99.

Customer: Wow, okay. And is there any kind of promotional pricing or anything like that?

Agent: (pause) Actually, let me check what we have available for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so we do have a promotion running. For new upgrades, you can get Fiber 300 for $59.99 a month for the first twelve months, then it goes to the regular price after that. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh, that's better. Yeah, that's... that's actually pretty reasonable. But before I decide, what's the difference between the 300 and the 500? Like, is it worth the extra money?

Agent: That's a good question. So Fiber 300 gives you 300 megabits per second download speeds, and Fiber 500 gives you 500 megabits per second. For your situation with three people online, I'd actually say the 300 should handle it really well. Upload speeds are also important for your wife's video calls, and both of those plans have strong upload speeds. The 500 would just give you more of a buffer if you ever want to stream 4K video or do really large file transfers.

Customer: Hmm. I think the 300 sounds like it would be enough. But like... if I upgrade, do I need a new modem or anything?

Agent: That's another great question. (typing sounds) Let me check what equipment you have. Okay, your current modem is the... it looks like the Model 2. I'd recommend upgrading to our Fiber-compatible Model 4, which supports those higher speeds much better. It's a one-time fee of $99, but we can actually waive that for you today if you go ahead with the upgrade.

Customer: Oh, seriously? Okay, that's... yeah, that's helpful. (pause) Yeah, I think I want to go for it. Let's do the Fiber 300.

Agent: Excellent choice, David! So let me just confirm everything before we proceed. You're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, you'll receive the promotional rate of $59.99 a month for the first twelve months, then $69.99 after that. We'll waive the modem fee and ship you the Model 4, and there's no contract or early termination fee. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds great. When would I be able to get the modem?

Agent: We can ship that out today, and you should receive it within three to five business days. Once you get it, we have instructions included, but it's really simple to set up. You'll just power it on and connect your devices.

Customer: Okay, perfect. And then the speed upgrade goes into effect right away after I plug it in?

Agent: Actually, we'll need to make the service upgrade on our end. (typing sounds) So I can schedule that for tomorrow between 8 AM and 6 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Tomorrow works. Let's say afternoon, like 2 PM?

Agent: Let me see what we have. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I've got you scheduled for a service upgrade tomorrow between 1 PM and 3 PM. You'll get an automated call as a courtesy reminder in the morning as well.

Customer: Great. And I don't need to be home for that, right? Like, it's just on your end?

Agent: Correct, it's all done remotely on our end. You don't need to do anything, and you shouldn't experience any service interruption. Should only take about fifteen minutes.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope, you're all set! Your new modem should arrive by Friday, and once you receive it and set it up, you're ready to go. I'll also send a confirmation email to the email address we have on file with all the details, including the tracking information for your modem. Is that email still [inaudible] at outlook dot com?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. David, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for your help, Marcus. I'm looking forward to the upgrade.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Enjoy your faster speeds, and have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
