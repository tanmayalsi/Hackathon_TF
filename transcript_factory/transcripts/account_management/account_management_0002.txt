# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey Marcus, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've got the, uh, the 100 megabit plan right now and it's just not cutting it anymore. I'm working from home a lot more, and my wife streams Netflix constantly, so...

Agent: I completely understand. Working from home definitely changes things. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my phone number associated with the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm seeing your account now. You've been with us for about two years, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, sounds about right. We switched over from... I think it was CenturyLink or something back then.

Agent: Great. And I'm showing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan at $49.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's the one.

Agent: Awesome. So what speeds were you looking to upgrade to? We have a few options available in your area. We offer Fiber 200 at 200 megabits per second, Fiber 500, and Fiber Gig which is our gigabit service.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. Um, how much more would that be? Like, what's the difference price-wise?

Agent: (pause) So our Fiber 200 would be $59.99 per month for the first year, then $69.99 after that. The Fiber 500 is $79.99 for the first 12 months, then $89.99. And our Fiber Gig, which gives you a full gigabit of speed, that's $89.99 for year one and then $99.99 after the promotional period ends.

Customer: Okay, so like... the 200 megabit would probably be fine for what we're doing, right? I mean, I don't want to overpay for something we don't need.

Agent: That's a really good question. The 200 plan is definitely a solid upgrade from your current 100. For streaming and working from home, it should handle multiple devices pretty well. Are you doing any video conferencing or downloading large files regularly?

Customer: Yeah, I'm on Zoom calls pretty much all day, actually. And sometimes I have to download files for work. Nothing crazy though.

Agent: Right, so the 200 plan should be perfect for that. You'd have plenty of headroom for your work calls and your wife's streaming at the same time. Unless you think you might need it down the road...

Customer: No, I think 200 is good. Let's do that. How fast can you get it switched over?

Agent: Excellent choice. (typing sounds) I'm going to add that to your account right now. The good news is that since you're already on our Fiber network, the upgrade is really seamless. We can actually activate it immediately on our end, so you should see the increased speeds pretty much right away. You shouldn't need a technician to come out or anything.

Customer: Oh really? That's... that's actually really nice. I was worried I'd have to schedule someone to come out.

Agent: Nope, not necessary in your case. Your modem supports the faster speeds, so it's all good. Now, I do want to let you know that since you've been such a loyal customer, I'm going to add another $10 off your first month as a courtesy. So instead of $59.99, your first month will be $49.99.

Customer: Oh, that's great! Thank you. So when does that change take effect? Like, starting next month or...?

Agent: (pause) Actually, since we can push this through immediately, it'll take effect today. So your next billing cycle will reflect the new rate. Let me just verify your email address is current so we can send you a confirmation. I'm showing [inaudible]@gmail.com. Is that still good?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. All set. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Any other services or...?

Customer: No, I think that's it. This is great. I'm really happy with the speeds we'll be getting. Thanks a lot, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You should see those faster speeds kick in within the next few hours. If you have any issues at all, just give us a call back and we'll take care of it.

Customer: Sounds good. Have a great day.

Agent: You too! Thanks for calling Frontier Communications. Take care now.
