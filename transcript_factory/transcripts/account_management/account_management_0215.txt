Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I've got the basic plan right now and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! I completely understand. Before we get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And can I also get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Jennifer Chen.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, Jennifer. I'm just pulling up your account here... Okay, I see you're currently on our Frontier 100 plan at $59.99 a month. Is that the service you're looking to upgrade?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Look, I've been with you guys for about three years now and it's been pretty good, but my kids started doing remote school this year and my husband works from home, and... (laughs) we're all fighting over bandwidth constantly. Netflix keeps buffering, video calls are dropping. It's a mess.

Agent: Oh man, I hear you. That's super frustrating, especially with everyone home now. So with multiple people streaming and on video calls simultaneously, you're definitely going to benefit from a faster speed. Let me tell you what we have available in your area.

Customer: Okay, great.

Agent: (typing sounds) So we offer speeds up to 400 Mbps with our Frontier 400 plan, which is $79.99 a month. Then we also have our Frontier 1 Gig, which is our top tier at 1 gigabit per second for $99.99 a month. Now, based on what you're describing with the multiple devices and streaming, I'd really recommend at least the 400 plan. That should handle everything you're throwing at it.

Customer: Okay, so... (pause) what's the actual difference between those two? Like, is the gig one worth it?

Agent: Great question. So, the 400 Mbps is really solid for most households. It'll handle multiple 4K streams, video conferencing, gaming, all of that without any issues. The 1 Gig is more future-proof and it's really beneficial if you're doing a lot of large file transfers, like if you're uploading videos regularly or have a ton of smart home devices. For your situation, honestly, I think the 400 would be perfect and save you twenty bucks a month.

Customer: Yeah, the 400 sounds good. That's only twenty dollars more than what I'm paying now, right?

Agent: Exactly. You'd go from $59.99 to $79.99, so it's a twenty dollar increase. Now, I should mention—are you currently under any contract with us?

Customer: Um... I don't think so? I've been there a while, so...

Agent: (typing sounds) No, I'm not seeing an active contract on your account, so you're good. You can upgrade whenever you'd like. Now, the upgrade can typically be processed within the next 48 hours, and you might experience a brief service interruption—usually just a few minutes—while our technicians push the new configuration to your equipment.

Customer: Wait, do I need a technician to come out? I don't really want someone in my house right now, honestly.

Agent: Great news—no technician needed! Since you already have our equipment from your current service, the upgrade is all done remotely. We just push it through and you're all set. Your speeds will jump up automatically.

Customer: Oh, that's perfect. That works for me.

Agent: Awesome. Um, just so you know, there is one small thing. Your current modem is a bit older, so to really maximize those 400 Mbps speeds, I'd recommend upgrading to our newer equipment. It's only an additional $10 a month and we'd ship it to you at no charge. You'd just swap it out yourself.

Customer: (slight hesitation) Is it... is it necessary?

Agent: So, technically you could still upgrade with your current equipment, but honestly, you might not see the full speeds you're paying for. The newer modem just has better capability. I'd say it's worth the extra ten bucks to get the most out of your service.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah. I'll do it. I want to actually see the improvement, you know?

Agent: [inaudible] absolutely makes sense. So I'm going to add the Frontier 400 plan and the equipment upgrade to your account. That brings your new monthly total to $89.99. How does that sound?

Customer: That's good. When would the new modem arrive?

Agent: (typing sounds) We have expedited shipping available, so you should have it within three to five business days. It'll come with full instructions, and there's actually a QR code on the box that walks you through the setup process. Super simple.

Customer: Okay, great. And the upgrade to the faster internet kicks in right away?

Agent: The speed upgrade will process within 48 hours. The modem will arrive separately, and once you install it, you'll get the full benefit of that 400 Mbps. So you might see a slight improvement right away, and then once the modem shows up, you'll really notice the difference.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: Just a couple things. One, keep an eye on your email for a confirmation of this upgrade. We'll send you tracking information for the modem as soon as it ships. And if you have any issues with the installation, just give us a call back and we can walk you through it. It's really straightforward though.

Customer: Great, I appreciate that.

Agent: And, uh, one last thing—because you've been a loyal customer for three years, I'm actually going to knock $5 off your first month. So instead of $89.99, your first bill will be $84.99.

Customer: (laughs) Oh wow, that's nice! Thank you!

Agent: Of course. We appreciate your business, Jennifer. So to recap: your new plan is Frontier 400 at $89.99 a month starting next billing cycle—$84.99 for the first month with your loyalty discount. You'll get the speed upgrade within 48 hours and the new modem within three to five business days.

Customer: That sounds great. I really appreciate your help, Marcus.

Agent: Happy to help! Is there anything else I can answer for you today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks again.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks so much for calling Frontier, and enjoy that faster internet! Have a great day.

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now!
