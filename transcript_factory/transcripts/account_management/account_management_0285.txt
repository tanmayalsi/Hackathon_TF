Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've got the 100 meg plan right now and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've had a lot of customers mentioning that lately, especially with more people working from home and streaming. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. That's been your service for about two years now, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, sounds right. Look, my kids are doing remote learning and I'm trying to work from home, and every time someone streams something or downloads a file, everything just... crawls. It's frustrating.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. With multiple people on the network doing bandwidth-intensive activities, 100 megs can definitely feel tight. The good news is we have some great options available at your address. (pause) Let me ask you—what kind of speeds were you thinking? Are you looking at our 400 meg plan, or would you want to go all the way up to our gig service?

Customer: Um... I'm not sure. What's the difference going to be, like, price-wise?

Agent: Great question. So your current bill is showing $89.99 a month for the 100 plan, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, so if you upgraded to our Fiber 400 plan, that would be $119.99 a month. And then our top tier, which is our Fiber Gigabit service, that's our full 1 gig up and down—that's $149.99 a month. (typing sounds) Now, the good news is we're currently running a promotion where I could lock you in at $129.99 for the gig service for the first year.

Customer: Oh really? So it would go up after that?

Agent: Yes, after the promotional period ends, it would move to the regular rate of $149.99. But you'd have a full year at the promotional rate, and you can always reassess then if you want. Honestly, for what you're describing with multiple people streaming and working, the gigabit plan would really be your best bet. It's future-proof, you know?

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's... actually not too bad. What about the modem or router or whatever? Do I need to get new equipment?

Agent: Good thinking. So with the gig service, we do recommend upgrading to our newer WiFi 6 compatible router. Your current modem and router combo can actually stay the same for the 400 plan if you wanted to go that route, but with gig speeds, you really want a modern router to take full advantage. We have a great option available. It's $15 a month, or you could purchase one outright for $199 if you wanted to own it.

Customer: And I get the router included or is that extra?

Agent: It would be an additional $15 a month on top of the service, or the one-time purchase of $199. A lot of customers like the monthly option because if anything ever happens to it, we replace it for free. (pause) But honestly, it pays for itself in about 13, 14 months if you purchase it.

Customer: Hmm. I'll probably do the monthly thing, just to keep it simple. But yeah, let's do the gigabit plan. That should handle what we're doing, right?

Agent: (typing) Absolutely. You're going to see a massive difference, especially with everything happening simultaneously in your house. Your kids will be able to stream their classes, you can have video calls without any lag, downloads will be almost instantaneous. It's night and day compared to 100 megs.

Customer: Sounds perfect. When can this be installed? Can you do it soon?

Agent: (pause) Let me check our availability in your area. (typing sounds) What does your schedule look like? Are you typically available weekdays or would a weekend appointment work better?

Customer: Um, weekdays are tough with everyone's schedules. Maybe a Saturday?

Agent: (typing) Okay, looking here... I can get you a Saturday appointment. We have Saturday the 14th available between 8 AM and 12 PM, or we have the 21st between 1 and 5 PM. Which works better for you?

Customer: The 14th, the morning slot sounds good. That's two weeks from now, right?

Agent: (typing) That's correct, Saturday the 14th, 8 AM to noon. Perfect. (pause) I should mention, depending on whether you need new fiber run to your home or if we can use the existing line, the technician might be there for an hour or two. They'll let you know when they arrive.

Customer: Okay, that's fine. So what's my new bill going to be?

Agent: (typing) So with the Fiber Gig service at the promotional rate for the first year, that's $129.99, and then we're adding $15 a month for the WiFi 6 router lease. So your new monthly total would be $144.99. That's a $55 increase from what you're paying now, but again, that promotional rate is locked in for 12 months.

Customer: Alright, that works. So I'm all set then?

Agent: Almost. I just need to confirm—is the service address the same as the phone number on file? (pause) It's showing 4782 Maple Drive, apartment 3C?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: (typing) Perfect. And the best number to reach you on appointment day is this number, 555-0147?

Customer: Yep, that's my cell.

Agent: Excellent. (pause) Okay, so let me recap everything for you. You're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber Gigabit service. Your promotional rate is $129.99 per month for the first 12 months, then $149.99. We're adding the WiFi 6 router lease at $15 a month. Your installation appointment is Saturday, March 14th between 8 AM and noon at 4782 Maple Drive, apartment 3C. You should receive a confirmation email and text within the next few minutes.

Customer: Great, I think I got all that. So when will the service actually be active?

Agent: The service will become active on your installation date. So everything will be live that Saturday after the technician completes the setup.

Customer: Perfect. One more thing—do I need to do anything before the technician shows up?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home during the window, obviously. (chuckles) Beyond that, the technician will handle everything. They'll run the fiber, set up the new equipment, test everything. You don't need to prep anything on your end.

Customer: Awesome. Thanks Derek, I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! I really think you're going to love the gig service—it's going to make a huge difference for your family. We're glad we could help, and thanks for being a Frontier customer. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, take care!

Agent: Bye now.
