Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek. Yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan is just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've had a lot of customers mentioning that lately. Let me just pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0147. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing here you're on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. A hundred megs, right? I mean, it was fine when I first got it, but now I work from home and my wife streams a lot, and... we've got like three other devices going at the same time. It just gets really slow.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. Working from home, especially with multiple users, definitely eats into your bandwidth. The good news is we have some really solid options available at your address. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you thinking something in the 300 to 500 range, or would you want to go all the way up to our gig plan?

Customer: Hmm, I don't know. I mean, I don't want to spend a fortune, but I also don't want to be dealing with this lag problem anymore. What's the difference in price between like... 300 and 500?

Agent: Great question. (typing sounds) So right now, we're running a promotion for new service upgrades. The Fiber 300 plan is $79.99 a month, and the Fiber 500 is $99.99 a month. And we also have our Fiber 1000, which is $129.99 for the first year, then it goes to $149.99.

Customer: Okay, and that's... that's locked in? Like, it won't go up?

Agent: The promotional rate is locked in for 12 months. After that first year, the price will increase, but I can definitely make a note on your account that you'd like to be contacted before any price changes take effect. That way you're not caught off guard.

Customer: Yeah, please do that. Um... I think 500 seems like a good middle ground. That should be enough for all of us, right?

Agent: Absolutely. The Fiber 500 is a fantastic option for households with multiple users and work-from-home situations. You'll definitely notice a huge difference coming from 100. (pause) And the good news is, since you're already on our network, there's no installation fee for the upgrade. We can get you switched over pretty quickly—could be as soon as tomorrow or the next day.

Customer: Wait, really? That fast?

Agent: Yep. We'll just need to push a configuration update to your modem, and you'll be good to go. Takes about fifteen minutes. You don't even need to be home for it, though you might want to restart your equipment just to make sure everything kicks in smoothly.

Customer: Oh nice. That's way easier than I thought. Okay, so Fiber 500 at... what was it, $99.99?

Agent: That's right. $99.99 a month for the first 12 months. (typing sounds) Let me just add that to your account here. (pause) Okay, so I'm showing the upgrade will be effective as of tomorrow. You should see the speed difference right away. Your bill will be updated to reflect the new rate starting next cycle.

Customer: Perfect. Um, is there anything else I should know? Do I need a new modem or anything?

Agent: Good question. Your current modem is actually compatible with the 500 plan, so you're all set there. If you do experience any issues after the upgrade, just give us a call back and we can troubleshoot. But I have a feeling you're going to be very happy with the improvement. (brief pause) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks a lot, Derek. I really appreciate it.

Agent: My pleasure. Thank you so much for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You're all set with the upgrade to Fiber 500 starting tomorrow. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Take care.

Agent: Thanks, bye now.
