Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer with you guys for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet plan. I think my current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, this is for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So I'm seeing here that you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. One hundred megabits per second, right?

Agent: That's exactly right—one hundred down, ten up. And you're saying the speeds aren't quite meeting your needs these days?

Customer: Right. I mean, it was fine at first, but now I'm working from home a lot more, and my wife is always streaming Netflix or whatever, and then my kids are doing their Zoom classes... it just seems like everything's buffering constantly. I feel like I need something faster.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. That's actually something we hear pretty often, especially with multiple people using the connection at the same time. The good news is we have some excellent options available at your address. Let me tell you what we have.

Customer: Okay, cool.

Agent: So right now, you've got our 100 plan at $59.99 a month. We also offer Frontier Fiber 300—that's 300 megabits down, 20 up—which would be $79.99 a month. And then our top tier is Fiber 500 at $89.99 a month. That gives you 500 down and 25 up. Which of those sounds more appealing to you?

Customer: Hmm, what's the difference between the 300 and the 500, really? Like, would I even notice it?

Agent: That's a fair question. So the 300 plan would definitely solve your buffering issues with multiple users. It's a big jump from what you have now. The 500 plan, though, that's really more if you have a lot of heavy users or if you're doing things like uploading large files regularly for work, gaming online, that kind of thing.

Customer: No, no, I'm not doing anything like that. I think the 300 should be fine then.

Agent: Perfect. I think that'll serve you really well. Now, I should mention we actually have a promotion running right now. If you upgrade to the Fiber 300 plan today, we can lock you in at $69.99 a month for the first year instead of $79.99. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh, really? That's... wait, that's actually cheaper than what I'm paying now, isn't it?

Agent: (pause) Let me just double-check your current bill here. Yes, you're right—you're at $59.99, so this would be about ten dollars more a month, but you're getting triple the speeds. And then after the first year, it would go to the regular $79.99 rate.

Customer: Right, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. So how does the upgrade process work? Do I need to get new equipment or anything?

Agent: Great question. So with the upgrade, we will need to send you a new modem that's compatible with the higher speeds. It's completely free—no charge for the equipment. Our technician can either install it for you, or you can do a self-installation, which also comes with a fifty-dollar credit on your account if you choose that option.

Customer: Oh, a fifty-dollar credit? That's nice. How long does installation usually take if a tech comes out?

Agent: A technician visit usually takes about an hour, and we offer appointments between 8 AM and 5 PM on weekdays, or we have some Saturday morning slots available too. Self-installation, if you're comfortable with it, is really straightforward—it takes maybe ten or fifteen minutes, and we provide detailed instructions.

Customer: I mean... I'm not super tech-savvy, so I think I'd rather just have someone come do it. When could they come out?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. It looks like we have an opening this Thursday between 1 and 3 PM, or we have Friday morning between 9 and 11 AM. Which works better for you?

Customer: Friday morning would be better. I'm working from home, but it's a little less hectic on Fridays usually.

Agent: Perfect. I'll get you scheduled for Friday, [inaudible]—sorry, let me just confirm the address one more time. That's 847 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's it.

Agent: Great. So to summarize everything: we're upgrading you from Frontier Fiber 100 to Frontier Fiber 300, promotional rate of $69.99 a month for the first year. A technician will come out Friday morning between 9 and 11 AM to install your new modem. Your new service will be active by Friday afternoon.

Customer: That sounds great. What happens to my old modem?

Agent: The technician will pick that up when they install the new one, so no need to worry about that. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Oh wait—one more thing. Is there any contract or anything like that?

Agent: Nope, no contract required. You're good to go whenever you want. And you'll receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details, including your technician appointment time.

Customer: Awesome. Thank you so much, Marcus. I appreciate your help.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and I hope you enjoy those faster speeds. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
