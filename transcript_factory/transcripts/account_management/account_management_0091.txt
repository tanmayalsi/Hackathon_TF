Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've had the same plan for like... three years now and it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause, typing) Perfect, I've got you here. I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Look, my kids are doing remote learning now and my wife works from home, so we're all online at the same time constantly. The connection keeps dropping and it's just been a nightmare, honestly.

Agent: Oh man, I totally understand. Multiple people streaming and video conferencing definitely pushes those speeds to the limit. (pause) So with Fiber 100, you're getting around 100 megabits download. What kind of speeds are you thinking you'd need?

Customer: I don't know exactly... what do you have available?

Agent: Great question. So in your area, we have several options. We can bump you up to Fiber 200, which is double your current speed at 200 megabits. Then we have Fiber 500, which is actually becoming really popular for families like yours, and we also offer Fiber 1 Gig if you want top-tier performance.

Customer: Okay, um... what's the price difference? I'm on like... I think $69.99 a month right now?

Agent: (typing) Let me check your current promotional rate here. (pause) Okay, so you're at $69.99 for the Fiber 100. If we move you to Fiber 200, that would be $89.99 a month. The Fiber 500 is $129.99, and the Fiber 1 Gig is $159.99.

Customer: Wow, so almost double for the gig plan...

Agent: I know it sounds like a jump, but honestly, with three people working and studying from home, that 1 Gig is gonna give you rock-solid performance. No more buffering, no more disconnects. Plus, I can add a promotion to the account that'll bring the first three months down to $119.99, so you can really test it out.

Customer: Really? That's helpful. What about after three months?

Agent: After three months, it would go to the regular $159.99 price. But here's the thing—I can lock that in for a year at that promotional rate if you commit to a one-year service agreement. That's an extra $40 a month savings for twelve months.

Customer: Okay, that's... actually pretty decent. (pause) But what if we don't like it? Can we downgrade?

Agent: Absolutely. You're not locked in permanently or anything. If you want to go back down to a lower tier, you can call us and we can make that change. The one-year pricing is just if you want the discount, but you can upgrade or downgrade anytime. There might be a small adjustment to your bill, but there's no penalty fee or anything like that.

Customer: And you said it's the same fiber connection I already have? I don't need a technician to come out?

Agent: Great question. Since you already have our Fiber 100 service active, we can actually provision the speed upgrade remotely in most cases. It usually takes about 24 hours to go live. However... (pause, typing) let me just double-check your line here. (brief pause) Yeah, so you should be all set. No technician visit needed unless you want us to do some troubleshooting on the connection while we're making the change.

Customer: No, I think that's fine. We're good with the setup.

Agent: Perfect. So just to confirm, you're interested in upgrading to the Fiber 1 Gig plan with the promotional pricing?

Customer: Yeah, let's do it. Let's go with the gig.

Agent: Excellent choice. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm gonna add the promotion and get this processed. I'm seeing here that with your current billing cycle, this change will take effect on the 15th of next month, and you'll see the new rate starting then. The upgrade itself should be live within 24 hours after that.

Customer: Okay, so I might see it active before the billing change?

Agent: Exactly, you got it. The speed upgrade could kick in anytime in that window, but the billing adjustment happens on your cycle date. You'll get a confirmation email with all the details, including your new account summary and the promotional terms.

Customer: Great. Do I need to do anything on my end? Like restart my router or anything?

Agent: You know what, that's a good instinct. Once the upgrade goes live, yeah, I'd recommend doing a quick restart of your modem and router—just unplug them for like 30 seconds and plug them back in. That'll make sure everything syncs up properly with the new speeds.

Customer: Will do. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: (pause) Let me think... oh, one thing—if you ever want to add our premium WiFi router, we offer that for like $10 a month. With gigabit speeds, a really solid router can make a huge difference in your WiFi performance throughout the house. Just something to keep in mind.

Customer: I'll think about it. But I think we're good for now.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm all set here. Your confirmation number is 847-FRO-229156. I'm gonna send that to you via email along with all the details of your upgrade. Is the email on file still current?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I think so. It's [inaudible]@gmail.com.

Agent: (typing) Great, got it. And the best number to reach you if we need anything is the 555-0147, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Awesome. Well, I really appreciate your business, and I think you're gonna be really happy with that gigabit speed. Your family's gonna have a much better experience working and learning from home.

Customer: Thanks, I really hope so. I'm excited to try it out.

Agent: You got it. Thanks so much for calling Frontier, and have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks!

Agent: Bye now. (line disconnects)
