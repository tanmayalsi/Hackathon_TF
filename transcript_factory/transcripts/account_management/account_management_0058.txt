Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet. I've got the basic plan right now and it's just... it's getting slow, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We have a lot of customers telling us the same thing, especially with more people working from home these days. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our 100 megabit plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've had it for about... I dunno, two years maybe? And it was fine at first, but now my wife's been streaming during the day when I'm trying to work from home, and it just gets all choppy and freezes up.

Agent: Yeah, that definitely makes sense. 100 megs can get stretched thin with multiple users streaming and working simultaneously. What kind of activities are you doing that you'd like better speeds for? Just so I can make sure we get you set up with the right plan.

Customer: Well, I'm doing video calls for work, uploading files to the cloud, that kind of thing. And my wife likes her Netflix. (laughs) So we need something that can handle all that without everything grinding to a halt, basically.

Agent: (laughs) Yeah, that's a pretty common setup. For that kind of usage, I'd definitely recommend our 300 megabit plan. That would give you plenty of bandwidth for video conferencing, file uploads, and simultaneous streaming without any issues. We also have a 500 meg option if you want to really future-proof yourself.

Customer: Okay, so what's the price difference? Like, how much more would I be paying?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check your promotional eligibility here. (pause) Great news—you're eligible for a pretty good promotion on the upgrade. Your current plan is $59.99 a month, and the 300 meg plan would be $79.99 for the first year, then $99.99 after that. The 500 meg is $119.99 after the first year. But for year one it'd be $89.99.

Customer: Hmm, so twenty bucks more for the 300? That's not too bad. What about the 500?

Agent: The 500 is an additional ten dollars on top of that. So $89.99 versus $79.99 for the first year. The difference is really whether you think you might want even more speed down the road. Honestly, for your use case, the 300 should be more than sufficient. Most people don't really notice a difference between 300 and 500 for typical household use.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I think the 300 makes sense. How soon can you get that set up?

Agent: Great choice! So I can process this upgrade for you right now, and it would go into effect... (typing sounds) ...tomorrow morning. You won't need any equipment changes either—your current modem is compatible with the higher speeds. You might notice it kicks in right around 6 AM.

Customer: Oh nice, I don't have to do anything? I don't have to switch boxes out or anything?

Agent: Nope, nothing on your end. We'll push the upgrade remotely. You're all set. The only thing I'd recommend is maybe restarting your modem later in the day, just to make sure it's pulling the new speeds correctly, but honestly it should update automatically.

Customer: Perfect. So just to confirm, it's $79.99 for the first year, and then it goes up to $99.99 after that?

Agent: That's correct. And just so you're aware, after the promotional period ends in 12 months, we'll send you a courtesy notice in the mail about the rate change. But you're always welcome to give us a call at that point—we might have other promotions available at that time.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. Um, is there anything else I should know?

Agent: (pause) Let me think... Oh, one thing—your next billing cycle starts on the 22nd, so the new rate will show up on your next bill. You'll see the prorated amount on this month's bill, reflecting the upgrade. You should get that within a few days.

Customer: Alright, I got it. Thanks for your help!

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate it.

Agent: Awesome. Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and thanks for calling in. You have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
