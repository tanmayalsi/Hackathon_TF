# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yes, um... I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Before we get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And I'm seeing an account for Jennifer Martinez at 2847 Oakwood Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Jennifer. So you're looking to upgrade your service. Can you tell me a little bit about what you're currently experiencing? What's prompting the upgrade?

Customer: Well, we've been on the 300 megabits plan, and honestly, it was fine for a while. But now we're working from home—both my husband and I—and we've got our daughter doing remote learning. So we're constantly running into buffering issues, especially during video calls. It's really frustrating.

Agent: I completely understand. Three people on one connection definitely adds up. (pause) So with our Fiber network, you've got some really solid options. We have plans up to 2 gigabits per second. What kind of usage are you looking at? Are you doing video conferencing, streaming... walk me through a typical day.

Customer: Yeah, so my husband and I both have back-to-back video meetings most of the day. HD quality stuff. And then in the evenings, we're usually streaming something, you know, Netflix or whatever. Plus, our daughter's on Zoom for school. Sometimes multiple things at once.

Agent: Okay, yeah, that's definitely going to benefit from a boost. Let me see what we have available at your location. (typing sounds, brief pause) Perfect. So I'm showing that you qualify for our Fiber service. We can get you up to our 1 gig plan, which is going to be more than enough for what you're describing. That's one thousand megabits per second. You'd see a huge difference from the 300 meg plan.

Customer: Okay, um... what does that run? Price-wise?

Agent: So our 1 gig plan is currently $89 a month for the first year with a promotional rate. After that, it goes to the standard rate of $119. And we'd waive the installation fee for you since you're an existing customer.

Customer: (pause) Wow, that's actually... that's a pretty big jump from what I'm paying now. What am I currently paying?

Agent: You're currently at $59.99 a month for the 300 meg plan.

Customer: Yeah, so that's like thirty dollars more.

Agent: Right, so it is an increase. But think of it this way—you're getting over three times the speed for less than double the price. And what you'll save in terms of frustration and productivity? Your husband being able to have a clear call without interruptions, your daughter's school not lagging out... that's pretty valuable.

Customer: That's fair. Um, is there anything in between? Like, do you have a 500 meg plan or something?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our current offerings for your address. We do have a 500 meg plan available at $74.99 a month for the first year, and then $99 after that. That would still be a significant upgrade from where you are now.

Customer: Hmm, and what's the difference gonna be for me, like, practically speaking?

Agent: Good question. The 500 meg plan would definitely handle your multiple video calls and streaming just fine. You'd see a noticeable improvement over the 300. The 1 gig is really more if you want that extra headroom, you know, if you're uploading large files, doing simultaneous 4K streams, or if you want future-proofing. But for your use case, honestly, 500 megs would serve you really well and you'd save ten dollars a month.

Customer: (pause) I think I'm leaning toward the gig plan. If we're doing this, I want to make sure we're not gonna run into the same problems in a year, you know?

Agent: I think that's a smart call. Future-proofing is never a bad idea.

Customer: Okay, let's do the gig plan then. When could someone come install it?

Agent: Excellent choice. (typing sounds) Let me check our installation calendar here. We have availability this week—how does Thursday or Friday look for you?

Customer: Thursday would be better for us. What time window would that be?

Agent: For Thursday, I can book you for an appointment between 1 PM and 5 PM. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, that works. My husband should be home by then.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) So just to confirm everything: we're upgrading you to our 1 gig Fiber plan at $89 for the first year, then $119 after. We're waiving the installation fee, and we have you scheduled for Thursday between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will handle the installation, and you should be good to go that same day.

Customer: Great. And, uh, do I need to do anything to prepare? Send back equipment or anything?

Agent: Good thinking. So our technician will handle most of it. We'll bring new equipment if needed. Your current modem and router... we'll assess those on Thursday and let you know if you need upgrades there. You don't need to do anything on your end right now.

Customer: Okay, awesome. Will I get a confirmation or something?

Agent: Absolutely. You'll receive a confirmation email within the next hour or so, and you'll get a courtesy reminder text message on Thursday morning before the appointment window.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you so much, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer! Just to recap, we sent that confirmation to your email on file. If you have any questions before Thursday or need to reschedule, just give us a call back. Otherwise, our technician will see you Thursday afternoon. Thanks for choosing Frontier!

Customer: Thanks! Have a great day.

Agent: You too, Jennifer. Take care!
