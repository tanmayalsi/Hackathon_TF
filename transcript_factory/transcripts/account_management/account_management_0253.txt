Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this for the service at 2847 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. I'm seeing here that you're currently on our Fiber 200 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Look, I've been with you guys for about three years now, and honestly, it was great at first, but my family's needs have changed. We're doing a lot more video calls for work, my kids are in online school part-time, and we're streaming on multiple devices now. It just seems like things are buffering more than they used to.

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually really common, especially over the last couple of years. More devices means we need more bandwidth. So, um, (pause) what kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you thinking about upgrading to our Fiber 500, or would you want to go even higher?

Customer: What's the difference between those two, exactly?

Agent: Great question. So Fiber 200 gives you 200 megabits per second download speeds. The Fiber 500 ups that to 500 Mbps, and then we have Fiber 1 Gig, which is our top-tier residential plan at one gigabit per second. For families like yours with multiple devices and video conferencing, I'd usually recommend at least the 500, but honestly, the Gig plan is becoming really popular because it future-proofs you for the next few years.

Customer: What's the pricing difference?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here... Your current Fiber 200 is $69.99 a month. The Fiber 500 would be $99.99 per month, and the Fiber 1 Gig is $129.99 monthly. However, we do have a promotion running right now. If you sign a two-year agreement, I can get you the Fiber 500 for $89.99 for the first twelve months, then it goes to the regular price after that.

Customer: Hmm, two years is a long commitment. What if I don't want to do that?

Agent: That's fair. Without the agreement, the Fiber 500 would be $99.99 right away, month-to-month. So you'd have the flexibility to cancel anytime without any early termination fees, but you wouldn't get that promotional pricing.

Customer: And the speeds would be the same either way?

Agent: Exactly the same. The service quality doesn't change, just the pricing and contract terms.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I think the two-year deal makes sense. Can you tell me when the upgrade would happen?

Agent: Absolutely. Since you're already on our Fiber network, this is actually just a service tier upgrade. We don't need to send a technician out or anything. I can schedule this to go live as soon as tomorrow, or we can do it on a date that works better for you.

Customer: Tomorrow would be great, actually. Will there be any downtime?

Agent: The upgrade typically takes about thirty minutes to an hour, and yes, your internet will be down during that window. It usually happens early morning, around 2 to 4 a.m. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's perfect. We'll all be asleep anyway.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. So I'm showing this upgrade scheduled for tomorrow between 2 and 4 a.m. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Any questions about the service or your bill?

Customer: Uh, actually, one more thing. Will my modem still work with the faster speeds, or do I need to get a new one?

Agent: Good thinking. What modem do you have currently? Is it one of ours that we provided?

Customer: I think so? It's got your logo on it. It's a Frontier modem.

Agent: Okay, great. If it's a Frontier modem, I can actually check the model on my end. (pause) [inaudible] ...looking here... and actually, I'd recommend a modem upgrade for optimal performance. Our newer models are specifically optimized for these higher speeds. But here's the thing—if you want to keep your current modem, it should still work, it just might not give you the full 500 Mbps speeds you're paying for.

Customer: Oh, okay. So I'd need to upgrade the modem then?

Agent: I would recommend it, yeah. We can ship one out to you, or you can pick one up at any of our retail locations. There's a one-time equipment fee of $99.99, but I can waive that for you as a courtesy since you're upgrading your service and you've been with us for three years. So that's free.

Customer: That's... that's pretty good, actually. Yeah, okay, let's do that.

Agent: Awesome. I'll get that modem ordered for you right now. It should arrive within 3 to 5 business days. (pause) And just so you know, there are instructions included, but it's super simple to set up. You just plug it in, and it'll auto-configure to your account.

Customer: That sounds easy enough. Great.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so let me just recap everything for you. Starting tomorrow morning, your Fiber 200 service will be upgraded to Fiber 500. Your monthly rate will be $89.99 for the first twelve months, then $99.99 after that, with a two-year agreement. We're sending you a new modem at no charge, which should arrive in 3 to 5 days. Does all of that sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Um, one last thing—will I get a confirmation email or something?

Agent: Absolutely. You'll receive an email confirmation of the service upgrade, and then a separate shipping notification when your modem ships. You'll also get the tracking information for that.

Customer: Perfect. I think that's everything.

Agent: Great! Well, thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and thank you for being a loyal customer. We really appreciate it. If you have any issues during the upgrade tonight or any questions about your new service, just give us a call back. Our support team is available 24/7.

Customer: Will do. Thanks a lot, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
