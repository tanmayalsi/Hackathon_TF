Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 megabit plan and I'm thinking about upgrading. My kids are doing virtual school now and we're just... we're maxing out the internet constantly. Multiple Zoom calls going at the same time, Netflix in the background, it's just gotten out of hand.

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually a really common issue we're hearing about these days, especially with remote learning. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here. So you're currently on our Fiber 500 plan at... looks like $79.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: Perfect. And you're looking to upgrade to handle more bandwidth? Are you interested in our Fiber Gig plan, or would you like to hear about some of our other options?

Customer: I mean, what's the difference? What do you have available in my area?

Agent: Great question. So we actually have two tiers above where you are now. We have our Fiber 750, which gives you speeds up to 750 megabits per second, and then our premium tier is the Fiber Gig, which is a full gigabit—so 1,000 megabits per second. (pause) The 750 is $109.99 a month, and the Gig is $139.99.

Customer: Wow, okay. So what's the difference in real-world terms? Like, would 750 actually be enough, or should I just go all the way?

Agent: That's a smart question. So honestly, for what you're describing—multiple video calls, streaming, gaming—I'd probably recommend starting with the 750. That gives you plenty of headroom, and it's going to be a noticeable upgrade from your 500. You're looking at 50% more speed, so those Zoom calls should be rock solid, and you can handle the Netflix in the background without any issues. The Gig is more if you're, like, running a business from home or have a really large household with everybody streaming at once.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, the 750 sounds like it might be the move. How quickly can you get that switched over?

Agent: So the good news is, since you're already on fiber, it's literally just a configuration change on our end. There's no equipment swap needed or anything like that. We can activate it immediately, and you should see the speed boost within the next hour or so.

Customer: Oh wow, that's fast. That's better than I expected.

Agent: Right? That's one of the perks of fiber. (typing sounds) So I'm gonna go ahead and process this upgrade for you. There is one thing I should mention—there's no contract change or anything, but we do have a promotional rate I can lock in for you. Normally the 750 plan is $109.99, but since you're a loyal customer, I can get you $99.99 for the first year. After that, it'll go to the regular price.

Customer: Oh, that's nice. I appreciate that. How long is that promo for?

Agent: That's locked in for twelve months. After that, you'd be at the regular rate unless you call back and we can work something else out. Most customers find that by then, they're pretty happy with the service and they stick with it. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm just completing the order here. Your account will reflect the new speed tier effective immediately. You should see the change populate within the next couple of hours.

Customer: Great. Is there anything I need to do on my end? Like, restart my router or anything?

Agent: You know what, just as a precaution, go ahead and restart your modem and your router. Just unplug them both, wait about thirty seconds, and plug them back in. That'll make sure everything synchronizes properly with the new speeds.

Customer: Okay, I can do that. Actually, while I have you on the line... I've been thinking about your home phone service. Do you still offer that?

Agent: We sure do. (typing sounds) Are you interested in adding that to your account?

Customer: Maybe. What's the pricing on that?

Agent: So our home phone service is $29.99 a month. It includes unlimited calling to the US and Canada, and it integrates right with your internet service. You can actually bundle it with your internet plan as well, and we typically offer a discount when you do. For your account, I could bundle the phone service and give you the internet and phone for $119.99 combined—that's a savings of about $10 a month off the regular pricing.

Customer: Hmm. You know, I'll think about that. Let me just get this internet upgrade going first and see if it solves the problem. Maybe I'll call back about the phone thing.

Agent: (pause) No problem at all. You've got my information right here on the account, and any of our agents can help you if you decide to add it later. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for being so helpful, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. Just to recap, your Frontier Fiber 750 service is now active, and you should see those speeds within a couple of hours. Make sure you restart that equipment when you get a chance. If you have any issues or questions, just give us a call back, and we'll be happy to help. Thanks for choosing Frontier!

Customer: Thanks. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Have a great day!
