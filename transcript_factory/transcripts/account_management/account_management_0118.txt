Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on your 500 meg plan, and honestly, I'm finding it's not really cutting it anymore. I work from home now, and my wife streams a lot, and we've got like three kids who are always on their devices, so... I'm thinking I need to upgrade.

Agent: Okay, I totally understand. Working from home and multiple users definitely puts a strain on bandwidth. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number, or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm seeing your account now. Yeah, you're on our Fiber 500 plan currently. And just to confirm, you're in the Scottsdale area, correct?

Customer: Yep, Scottsdale.

Agent: Great. So we actually have some excellent options for you. Our Fiber 1 Gig plan would be perfect for what you're describing—that's double your current speed. And actually, we're running a promotion right now where you can upgrade for just an additional $20 a month on top of what you're currently paying. Are you interested in hearing more about that?

Customer: Oh wow, really? Only twenty bucks more? What's the difference between that and what I have now, like, specifically?

Agent: Great question. So your Fiber 500 gives you 500 megabits per second download speed. The Fiber 1 Gig doubles that to 1 gigabit per second, which is 1,000 megabits. So it's literally double the speed. For your situation with multiple users streaming and working from home, that's gonna make a huge difference—faster downloads, faster uploads, way better performance when multiple devices are connected.

Customer: Okay, so it's literally double the speed. And you said it's only an extra twenty a month?

Agent: That's right. With the current promotion, it's just $20 more per month. Your current bill is... (typing sounds) ...it looks like $89.99 a month, so you'd be looking at $109.99 with the upgrade.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) What about the 2 Gig plan? Do you have something faster than that?

Agent: We do actually. We offer Fiber 2 Gig, which is twice the speed of the 1 Gig plan. However, that one would be an additional $40 a month on top of your current plan, so that would bring you to around $129.99 a month. But I'll be honest, for most households with a few people streaming and working from home, the 1 Gig is really the sweet spot. The 2 Gig is more for... you know, really heavy users or small businesses.

Customer: Right, right. I mean, I don't think I need to go that crazy. The 1 Gig sounds good. Um, and there's no equipment fee or anything like that?

Agent: Great question. So there's no additional equipment fee for the upgrade itself. You might need a newer modem to take full advantage of the gigabit speeds—we can check if yours is compatible. What modem model are you currently using?

Customer: Oh, um... (pause) I have no idea, honestly. It's just the one you guys gave me when we set up the service.

Agent: That's totally normal. You know what, we can send a technician out to upgrade you, and they'll make sure everything is compatible and properly set up. There's a standard service visit fee of $99, but with the promotion, that's actually waived for you.

Customer: Oh, okay! So no service fee?

Agent: Correct, no service fee. The technician will come out, upgrade the modem if needed, make sure everything's running at full capacity, and do a speed test to confirm everything's working properly.

Customer: That's perfect. And how long does that usually take?

Agent: The visit typically takes about an hour, hour and a half. And I can schedule you for a time window that works with your schedule. We have availability... (typing sounds) ...we've got some open slots this Friday between 12 and 4 PM, or next Tuesday between 9 AM and 1 PM. What works better for you?

Customer: Friday is better. Let's do Friday, maybe in the afternoon?

Agent: Okay, so Friday between 2 and 4 PM?

Customer: Yeah, that works.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I've got you scheduled for this Friday from 2 to 4 PM. A technician will arrive at your address in Scottsdale. Is the address on file still 4821 North Granite Way?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Excellent. So just to recap everything for you: you're upgrading from Fiber 500 to Fiber 1 Gig, that's an additional $20 per month on your bill, bringing it to $109.99. We're waiving the service fee, and you've got a technician scheduled for this Friday from 2 to 4 PM. You should also receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all these details and a phone number you can call if you need to reschedule.

Customer: That sounds great, Derek. Thanks for walking me through all that. One more thing—do I need to do anything before the technician gets there?

Agent: Nope, just make sure someone's home to let them in, and that's it. Oh, and just turn everything off before they arrive so they can do a fresh installation. But that's it, really.

Customer: Perfect. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and enjoy that gigabit speed! Have a great day.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
