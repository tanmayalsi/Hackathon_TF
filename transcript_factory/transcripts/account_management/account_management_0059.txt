Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet service. I've been a customer for about three years now, and honestly, my current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've got some great options available. Before we dive in, can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And your name?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Alright, David, I've got your account pulled up here. I'm seeing you're currently on our 100 megabits per second plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. And like I said, it's just not fast enough anymore. I've got my kids doing remote schooling, my wife's working from home most days now, and we're all trying to stream at the same time. It's been really frustrating.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. A hundred megs can definitely get stretched thin with multiple users. So what kind of speeds are you looking for? Are you interested in our 300 meg plan, or would you want to go higher?

Customer: Well, what do you recommend? I want something that'll actually be future-proof, you know? I don't want to be calling back in a year complaining about the same problem.

Agent: That's smart thinking. (pause) So, we actually have fiber available at your address, which is fantastic. I'd honestly recommend our 500 megabits per second plan. It's got plenty of headroom for multiple devices, streaming, video calls, everything. And frankly, at your price point, it's the sweet spot.

Customer: Five hundred? That seems like a lot. What's the difference in price between that and the 300?

Agent: (typing sounds) Good question. So right now, the 300 meg plan is running $79.99 a month. The 500 meg plan is $99.99 a month. So it's an additional twenty dollars, but you're more than doubling your speeds.

Customer: Hmm. And how long would the price lock in for?

Agent: The promotional rate is locked in for twelve months. After that, it goes to the regular price, which I can be transparent with you—it would be about $129.99. But you'd get that promo rate for the first year guaranteed.

Customer: Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. What about installation? Would there be any fees?

Agent: That's the best part. Since you're a valued existing customer, we can waive the installation fee. Normally that's $99, but I'll get that removed for you.

Customer: Oh, that's great! (pause) So when could you get a technician out here to set that up?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability. What days work best for you?

Customer: Um, I'm pretty flexible. Next week is better than this week, though. Weekday morning if possible.

Agent: Okay, so I'm looking at our schedule... (pause) How about Tuesday, the 14th, between 8 AM and 12 PM? Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, Tuesday morning is perfect.

Agent: Excellent. (typing sounds) Alright, so I've got you scheduled for Tuesday, January 14th, morning window. Our technician will be out to upgrade your modem and make sure you're all set with the fiber connection. They'll test everything on-site to make sure you're hitting those 500 megs.

Customer: Great. Do I need to do anything to prepare?

Agent: Just make sure someone's home to let the technician in. They'll have an ID, of course. And if you've got any questions about the service or anything else before then, feel free to give us a call back. Oh, and just so you know, you might experience a brief outage—maybe five, ten minutes max—when they're making the switch over.

Customer: Okay, I'll let my wife know about that. Are there any other changes I should be aware of?

Agent: Not really. Your email addresses stay the same, your modem will be upgraded, but honestly, the experience for you should just be... faster. (laughs) Much faster.

Customer: (laughs) I appreciate that. So just to confirm—I'm going from 100 megs to 500 megs for $99.99 a month with no installation fee?

Agent: That's exactly right. And the first month will have your promotional pricing locked in. You'll see the change reflected on your next bill.

Customer: Perfect. I think that's everything. Oh wait—do I need to return my old modem?

Agent: Great question. Yes, the technician will actually swap it out on-site, so they'll take the old one with them. You won't have to worry about it.

Customer: Awesome. I think I'm all set then.

Agent: Wonderful, David. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for making this easy.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details about your appointment on the 14th. If you need anything before then, just give us a call.

Customer: Will do. Have a good one.

Agent: You too, David. Thanks for calling Frontier!
