Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now and I'm pretty happy with the service, but I'm thinking about upgrading. My current plan is like... I think it's the 100 meg plan?

Agent: Great! I'm glad to hear you've been satisfied with us. Let me just pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. Sarah Mitchell, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Wonderful, Sarah. And yes, I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan at $59.99 a month. What's prompting the upgrade today? Are you having any issues with your current speeds, or...?

Customer: No, no, the speeds are fine, honestly. It's just... my kids are doing remote schooling now and my husband works from home, and we've got like four devices streaming constantly. Netflix, YouTube, all that stuff. And I've noticed things have been getting a little sluggish lately, especially in the evenings.

Agent: Oh yeah, that's pretty common with multiple users and devices competing for bandwidth. I totally understand. So what we'd want to look at are our higher-tier plans. We've got Fiber 500, which gives you 500 megabits per second, and then our Fiber Gig plan, which is our top tier at one gigabit per second.

Customer: Okay, so what's the price difference?

Agent: (pause) So your Fiber 100 is $59.99 monthly. Our Fiber 500 would be $89.99 a month, and the Fiber Gig—that's our gigabit plan—is $129.99 per month.

Customer: Hmm, okay. And I'd need a new modem or router or something?

Agent: Good question. So with the Fiber Gig plan, we would need to upgrade your equipment. You'd get a newer modem and router that can actually handle those speeds. With the Fiber 500, your current equipment should be fine, but we'd recommend the newer equipment to get the full benefit. The upgrade to our latest modem and router would be included with the installation at no additional cost.

Customer: Oh, that's nice. So what would the installation look like? Would someone have to come out?

Agent: Yeah, so since you're already an established customer with fiber service at your location, the installation would be pretty straightforward. A technician would just need to come out and swap out your equipment, reconfigure some things on our end. It's usually about an hour, maybe 90 minutes. And we can schedule that at your convenience. We have appointments available as early as this Saturday if that works for you.

Customer: This Saturday? That's actually perfect. Um, so between the 500 and the gig plan... what would you recommend?

Agent: (slight pause) Well, that really depends on your usage. If you've got four people streaming HD content simultaneously, the Fiber 500 would definitely handle that with room to spare. The Fiber Gig is more if you're doing a lot of large file transfers, multiple 4K streams, or if you want future-proofing for the next few years. But honestly, for your situation, I'd say the 500 plan would give you that peace of mind without the extra cost.

Customer: Yeah, that makes sense. And there's no contract or anything, right? I can cancel anytime?

Agent: Correct. Frontier doesn't require any long-term contracts. You can modify or cancel your service anytime without penalties. Though I will say, once you experience the speeds with Fiber 500, you'll probably be happy you made the switch. (chuckles)

Customer: (laughs) Yeah, my kids would probably revolt if I downgraded them again. Okay, so Fiber 500 it is.

Agent: Excellent choice. So let me just confirm what we're looking at. I'm going to upgrade you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500, which increases your speed to 500 megabits per second. Your rate will go from $59.99 to $89.99 per month. And we'll include the modem and router upgrade at no charge with the installation visit.

Customer: That all sounds right.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And when would you like to schedule that technician visit? We have Saturday the 22nd available, or if that doesn't work, we have weekday slots the following week.

Customer: Saturday the 22nd in the morning would be ideal. Like, before noon if possible?

Agent: (pause) Let me check what we have available... Yes, we have a 9 AM to 11 AM window open on Saturday the 22nd. Would that work?

Customer: Perfect, yeah, that works great.

Agent: Wonderful. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. (typing sounds) Alright, I've got you down for Saturday, March 22nd, between 9 and 11 AM. A technician will arrive at your address. You should receive a confirmation email within the next 30 minutes, and we'll also send a text reminder the day before.

Customer: Great, I really appreciate that.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Sarah?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thank you so much.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your loyalty as a customer. You're going to love the improved speeds. Have a great day, Sarah.

Customer: You too, thanks again, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
