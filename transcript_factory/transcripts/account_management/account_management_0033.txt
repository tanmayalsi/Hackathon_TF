Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, so I've been a customer with you guys for about three years now, and I'm really happy with the service, but I'm thinking about upgrading my internet.

Agent: That's great to hear! I'm glad you're enjoying your service with us. I'd be happy to help you explore your upgrade options. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account real quick?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this the account for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's the one.

Agent: Wonderful. So I'm looking at your account here, and I see you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct. And honestly, it's been pretty solid, but my kids are doing online school now, and we've got like four devices streaming at once sometimes, and... I don't know, it just seems like things are getting a little slow.

Agent: I completely understand. Especially with multiple people working and learning from home these days, bandwidth can definitely become an issue. (pause) So let me ask you this—what speeds are you looking for? Are you thinking something like 300 megabits, or were you interested in something even faster?

Customer: I wasn't really sure, to be honest. What would you recommend?

Agent: Well, it really depends on your usage. With four devices streaming simultaneously, I'd say you'd probably want to look at our Fiber 300 plan at minimum. That gives you 300 megabits per second download speeds. That's three times what you're currently getting, so you should see a noticeable difference. We also have our Fiber 500 and Fiber Gig plans if you wanted to go even higher.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference in price?

Agent: Great question. (typing sounds) So your Fiber 100 plan is currently running you $69.99 a month, right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, so if you upgrade to Fiber 300, we can get you set up at $89.99 a month for the first twelve months, and then it goes to $99.99 after that. The Fiber 500 is $119.99 for the first year, and then $129.99. And our Fiber Gig, which is our top tier at one gigabit per second, that's $149.99 for the first twelve months.

Customer: Hmm, and there's no installation fee or anything like that?

Agent: Actually, that's a great question. Normally we do have a $99.99 installation fee, but I'm seeing here that we have a promotion running right now—if you upgrade to Fiber 300 or higher, we can waive that fee for you.

Customer: Oh, that's awesome. (pause) I think the 300 plan sounds good then. That should be plenty for what we need.

Agent: Excellent choice! You're going to see a real improvement there. (typing sounds) Let me just get some information from you to process this upgrade. Is the service address still the same?

Customer: Yes, same address.

Agent: Perfect. And we can get a technician out there to upgrade your equipment. When would be a good time for you? We have availability... let me see here... we have next Tuesday between 8 AM and 12 PM, or Thursday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM.

Customer: Tuesday morning works better for us.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I've got you scheduled for Tuesday, March 14th between 8 AM and 12 PM. The technician will replace your modem and router with our newer equipment to support those faster speeds. The visit should take about an hour, maybe a little more. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! I really appreciate your business, and I think you're going to be really happy with those speeds. You should start seeing the improvement right away on Tuesday. We'll send you a confirmation email with all the details. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's perfect. Thank you.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
