Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. My current plan is just... I think it's like 100 megabits? And honestly, it's been pretty slow lately, especially when my kids are doing their schoolwork from home and I'm trying to work remotely.

Agent: I completely understand. Working and learning from home definitely requires a solid connection. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number associated with your Frontier account, please?

Customer: Yeah, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service at... 2341 Oakmont Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So I'm looking at your account now, and you're absolutely right. You're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. That's been your service for about three years now, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Okay, well, the good news is that you're in one of our areas where we've actually upgraded our infrastructure significantly. We now offer speeds up to 2 gigabits per second. I'd recommend looking at our Fiber 500 or Fiber 1 Gig plans. The Fiber 500 is a really popular choice for families with multiple people online. That gives you 500 megabits download and 250 upload.

Customer: (pause) Wow, okay. What's the price difference? I mean, I don't want to break the bank, but I definitely need something faster.

Agent: (typing sounds) So your current plan is $64.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: The Fiber 500 plan is $89.99 per month, so that's an increase of $25. However, we're currently running a promotion where we can lock that rate in for the first year at $79.99 if you commit to a one-year agreement. After that, it goes to the regular $89.99.

Customer: Hmm, and what about the gig plan? What's that one?

Agent: The Fiber 1 Gig gives you one gigabit download and 500 megabits upload. That's normally $119.99 a month, but with our current promotion, it's $99.99 for the first year with a one-year commitment.

Customer: (pause) That's... that's pretty significant. Is there a big difference between 500 and 1 gig? Like, practically speaking?

Agent: That's a great question. For most households with four or five devices streaming simultaneously, 500 megs is more than enough. The gig plan is really ideal if you're running a business from home, you have a lot of video conferencing, or you're uploading large files regularly. Since you mentioned your kids are doing schoolwork and you're working remotely, the 500 plan would probably serve you really well.

Customer: Okay, yeah. That makes sense. So I'd go with the 500 plan. Um, do I need to do anything with my equipment? Like, do I need a new modem or router?

Agent: (typing sounds) That's another good question. Let me just check what modem you currently have on the account. (pause) Okay, so you're on the Frontier-provided ASUS modem from when the account started. Honestly, that's still a pretty solid modem for what you're doing, but to take full advantage of the 500 plan, I would recommend upgrading to our newer Frontier Wi-Fi 6 modem router combo. It's $15 a month, but it's a really significant upgrade in terms of coverage and speed.

Customer: Do I have to?

Agent: No, you don't have to. You could keep your current modem and still get the speeds, but your Wi-Fi performance might not be as good throughout your house. A lot of customers in your situation find that it's worth the investment for the better coverage, especially if you have devices in multiple rooms.

Customer: (pause) What happens to my current modem? Do I need to return it?

Agent: Yes, we would need you to return it, but we cover all the shipping costs for that. We'd send you a prepaid return label, so it's very easy. You'd just pack it up and drop it off.

Customer: Okay, that's fair. Alright, I think... I think I want to do the Fiber 500 with the new modem. Let's do it.

Agent: Excellent choice. I think you're going to be really happy with that upgrade. (typing sounds) Okay, so just to confirm everything here. You're upgrading from Fiber 100 to Fiber 500 at $79.99 per month for the first year, then $89.99 after that, with a one-year service commitment. You're also adding the Frontier Wi-Fi 6 modem router at $15 per month. Does all of that sound correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And I've got a few other quick things. Are you aware that we offer a network security service called Frontier Secure Plus? It includes things like malware protection, identity theft monitoring, and—

Customer: You know what, I appreciate it, but I think I'm good with security stuff. I've already got my own setup.

Agent: No problem at all. I totally understand. (pause) Okay, so the installation appointment. Your area typically has availability within three to five business days. Would you prefer an appointment time, or would you be comfortable with a standard four-hour window?

Customer: Um... what's the difference?

Agent: With a specific time slot, we can narrow it down to a one-hour window, usually. It does depend on technician availability, but it costs $59.99 as a one-time fee. The four-hour window is included at no extra charge.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, let's just do the four-hour window. That's easier for me anyway.

Agent: Great. So we have availability on Thursday, November 17th between 8 AM and noon, or Friday the 18th between 1 PM and 5 PM. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Friday afternoon works better. The 18th, 1 to 5 PM.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I've got you scheduled for Friday, November 18th, between 1 PM and 5 PM. You'll receive a text message and an email confirmation with all the details, including the technician's information if we have that available the day before.

Customer: Okay, great.

Agent: The technician will take care of the installation of your new fiber connection, set up the new modem, run all the connection tests, and make sure everything is running smoothly. The installation typically takes about 30 to 45 minutes.

Customer: Sounds good.

Agent: And just so you know, your service will be interrupted during the installation, but once it's complete, you'll be good to go. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Derek. I really appreciate your help.

Agent: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You're going to love that faster speed. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
