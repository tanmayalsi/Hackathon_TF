Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. I've been with you guys for about three years now and I'm just... I'm not getting the speeds I need anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you being a loyal customer! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I've got you. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 300 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. It was great when I first got it, but now I'm working from home a lot more, and my wife streams constantly, and honestly, the speeds have just been... they're not cutting it. We've been getting a lot of buffering, especially in the evenings.

Agent: Oh, I totally understand. Multiple users and streaming can definitely max out a 300 megabit connection pretty quick. The good news is you're in one of our fiber service areas, so we've got some fantastic options available for you. Do you mind if I ask what your typical usage looks like? Like, are we talking video conferencing, large file uploads, that kind of thing?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I do video calls pretty much all day, and then my wife will have Netflix or Hulu going. And our kids are always on their tablets or whatever. So it's... it's a lot of bandwidth being used at the same time.

Agent: Definitely sounds like you'd benefit from more capacity. So right now we have three fiber options available in your area. We have our Fiber 500, which is 500 megabits, then Fiber 1 Gig, which is one gigabit, and actually, we just rolled out Fiber 2 Gig in your neighborhood about six months ago, which gives you two gigabits of download speed.

Customer: Wow, okay. So what's the difference in price? Like, how much more would I be paying for something like the 1 Gig?

Agent: (pause) Great question. So your current plan is $79.99 a month, right? For the Fiber 500, we could do $99.99, and the Fiber 1 Gig would be $129.99. Now, I should mention that if you're interested, we're actually running a promotion right now where new upgrades get their first three months at 50% off.

Customer: Oh, really? That's... that's pretty good. So I'd be looking at like, $65 a month for the first three months and then $130 after?

Agent: Exactly right. And honestly, for your situation with the multiple devices and the work-from-home situation, I'd probably recommend looking at the 1 Gig. The 500 might help in the short term, but you're probably going to feel that same crunch again in a year or two.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, you know what, that makes sense. Is there any... I mean, do I have to sign a new contract or anything like that?

Agent: No contract required. That's one of the great things about Frontier now. All our fiber plans are month-to-month, so you can change whenever you want. The promotion does require you to keep the service for at least three months to get the full discount benefit, but there's no long-term commitment.

Customer: Okay, and when could the upgrade actually happen? Like, would I need someone to come out?

Agent: Great question. So the good news is since you're already a fiber customer in your area, you won't need a technician visit. We can actually push the upgrade to your modem remotely, and it should take effect within 24 hours. Sometimes it's even faster, like a few hours. The only thing you might want to do is restart your modem once you get a notification from us that the upgrade is complete.

Customer: Oh, that's super convenient. I was worried it was going to be a whole thing.

Agent: Nope, nice and easy. (typing sounds) So I can go ahead and process this upgrade for you right now if you'd like. I'll get you set up on the Fiber 1 Gig with the promotional pricing, and I'll make sure the system sends you an email confirmation with all the details.

Customer: Yeah, let's do it. Do I need to... like, will my bill change right away?

Agent: Your bill will reflect the new rate starting your next billing cycle. Since you're mid-cycle right now, your next bill will show a prorated amount for the remainder of this month at your current rate, and then starting the following month, you'll see the promotional pricing kick in.

Customer: Okay, that's good. Um, one more thing—is there anything I need to do on my end? Like, any equipment changes or...?

Agent: (typing sounds) Nope, all set there. Your current modem is compatible with the 1 Gig speeds, so you won't need anything new. Just keep an eye out for that notification email from us, restart your modem when you get it, and you should be good to go.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks for walking me through all that. This should definitely help.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Great! Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You should see that upgrade notification within the next 24 hours. If you have any issues or questions, just reach out to us. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye now.
