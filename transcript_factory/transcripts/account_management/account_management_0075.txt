Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi Marcus. Um, I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me just pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your phone number or account number to get started?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Okay, so I'm looking at your account here. You're currently on our 100 Mbps plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I mean, it was fine when I first got it, but now I'm working from home a lot more, my wife streams while the kids are doing school on Zoom, and... it just keeps buffering and disconnecting. It's getting really frustrating.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, I totally understand. With more people on the network now, that 100 meg plan can definitely struggle. The good news is we've got some great options available in your area. We actually just upgraded our infrastructure there, so we can offer some faster speeds now.

Customer: Nice, okay. So what are we talking about? Like what's available?

Agent: So we have our 300 Mbps plan, our 500 Mbps plan, and actually... (brief pause) ...we just rolled out our gigabit fiber service in your neighborhood. That's our 1 Gig plan. You'd be getting one gigabit per second, which is... I mean, it's basically future-proof at this point.

Customer: Whoa, okay. (laughs) That seems like a lot. Like, would I even need that much?

Agent: (laughs) It's a fair question. For what you described—multiple people streaming, working from home, the Zoom calls—I'd honestly say the 500 Meg plan would give you plenty of headroom. But the gigabit is actually really competitively priced right now. We're running a promotion through the end of the month.

Customer: Oh, a promotion? What's that looking like?

Agent: (typing sounds) So right now, if you upgrade to either the 500 Meg or the gig plan, we're waiving the installation fee. That's usually seventy-five dollars. Plus, we're giving you a rate lock for the first twelve months, so your rate won't increase during that time.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad. How much more would I be paying versus what I'm paying now?

Agent: Let me check your current bill. (pause) Okay, so you're at $59.99 a month for the 100 Meg plan. The 500 Meg plan would be $79.99 a month with the promotion, and the gig plan would be $99.99 a month. Both with that twelve-month rate lock.

Customer: Hmm, so we're looking at like an extra twenty or forty bucks a month. What's the difference really going to be between the 500 and the gig? Like, practically speaking?

Agent: That's a great question. Honestly, for most households, 500 megs is really solid. You could have multiple streams going, video calls, downloads happening simultaneously without any issues. The gigabit is more if you're thinking about the future, like if you're going to have more people in the home, or if you want that extra buffer. Some people also like it just for the download speeds—you can download large files in like seconds instead of minutes.

Customer: (pause) You know what, I think the 500 would probably be perfect for us. Let's not go overboard. How long would this promotion last if I wanted to wait a little bit?

Agent: It's valid through the end of August, so you've got a few weeks if you want to think about it. But I will say that promotions like this don't always stick around, and honestly, the sooner we get you upgraded, the sooner you can stop dealing with those connection issues.

Customer: (laughs) Yeah, that's fair. Alright, let's go ahead and do it. The 500 Meg plan.

Agent: Excellent choice. Okay, so I'm going to set that up for you right now. (typing sounds) I do want to let you know that with fiber internet, your current modem might not be compatible. Do you currently own your modem or are you leasing it from us?

Customer: Um, I think I'm leasing it? I'm not entirely sure, to be honest.

Agent: No problem. Let me check. (pause, typing sounds) Yes, you're leasing it. That's $10 a month. With the 500 Meg plan, I can swap that out for our newer fiber-compatible modem at no additional cost. You'll just need to send back your old one, or we can arrange a pickup if that's easier.

Customer: Oh nice, okay. So I don't get charged extra for that?

Agent: Nope, no extra charge. We'll just swap them out when the technician comes for the installation. Speaking of which, do you want to schedule an installation date? With the waived installation fee, we'll send a tech out to get everything set up and running.

Customer: Yeah, sure. When's the earliest you can get someone out here? I'm working from home, so I'm pretty flexible.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let's see... we've got availability starting next Tuesday. Do morning or afternoon work better for you?

Customer: Afternoon would be better. Maybe like after noon?

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I'm seeing we have a slot on Tuesday, August 13th between 1 PM and 5 PM. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Great. I'm going to get that scheduled for you. (pause, more typing) Okay, so to confirm, you're upgrading to our 500 Mbps fiber plan at $79.99 a month with the twelve-month rate lock. Installation is waived, and we'll be doing a modem swap at no extra charge. Your appointment is Tuesday, August 13th, between 1 and 5 PM.

Customer: Perfect, that sounds great.

Agent: Awesome. So I'm going to email you a confirmation with all these details, your appointment confirmation number, and some information about preparing for the installation. You'll want to make sure you're near your modem and that we have clear access to your entry point. The tech will go over all that when they arrive, but—

Customer: Got it, yeah, that makes sense.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks a lot, Marcus. I'm pretty excited to get faster internet.

Agent: (laughs) You're going to love it, I'm sure. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. We'll see you on Tuesday. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
