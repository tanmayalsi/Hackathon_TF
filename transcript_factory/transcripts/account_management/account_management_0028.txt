Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've got the 100 meg plan right now, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've actually got some great options available. Before we dive into that, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this David Chen?

Customer: Yep, that's me.

Agent: Awesome, David. So I'm pulling up your account here, and I see you've been with us for about three years on our 100 megabit fiber plan. What's been going on that's making you feel like you need more speed?

Customer: Well, I've been working from home a lot more lately, and my roommate streams like... constantly. Netflix, YouTube, you know. And then when I'm trying to upload files for work, everything just gets really slow and choppy. I think I need something faster.

Agent: Yeah, that makes total sense. Multiple users and uploads can definitely eat up that bandwidth pretty quick. So we've got a couple of options for you. We can bump you up to our 300 megabit plan, which is a really popular option, or if you want to go all out, we've got our gigabit plan at 1,000 megs.

Customer: Okay, so what's the price difference? I'm currently paying... I think it's like $79 a month?

Agent: (pause) Let me just double-check that here... Yes, $79.99 for the 100 meg plan. So the 300 meg plan would be $99.99 a month, and the gigabit plan is running $129.99. Those are our standard rates.

Customer: Hmm, okay. And do you guys have any promotions or anything? I feel like when I signed up, I got some kind of deal.

Agent: Great question. Let me see what we have available for upgrade offers... (typing sounds) Okay, so because you're an existing customer in good standing, I can actually get you the 300 meg plan for $89.99 a month for the first year. How does that sound?

Customer: Oh, that's better. But like... after the first year it goes back up to $99.99?

Agent: Correct, yes. After the promotional period ends, it would be our standard rate of $99.99 per month. But honestly, at that price point, you're getting three times the speed for just twenty bucks more than you're paying now.

Customer: Right, that makes sense. Um, what about the gigabit plan? Any deals on that?

Agent: For the gigabit plan, I can do $119.99 for your first year instead of the standard $129.99. So you'd save ten dollars there as well.

Customer: (pause) That's only a ten dollar difference from the 300 meg plan...

Agent: Exactly. So for just ten dollars more per month, you'd be getting over three times the speed compared to the 300 plan. A lot of customers actually go for it when they see how close the pricing is. Plus, with gigabit speeds, you're really future-proofing your connection. Great for streaming, gaming, working from home, all of it.

Customer: Yeah, you know what? That actually does sound like a good deal. Let's go with the gigabit plan.

Agent: Excellent choice, David. I think you're gonna be really happy with that. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm gonna set that up for you right now. The upgrade should take effect on your next billing cycle, which looks like... that would be next Tuesday. We won't need to send a technician out or anything—this is just a speed tier upgrade, so it'll all happen on the backend.

Customer: Oh, that's convenient. So I don't have to do anything?

Agent: Nope, nothing on your end. Your modem is already capable of handling gigabit speeds, so you're all set. You might just want to restart your router once we make the switch, just to be safe, but other than that, you're good to go.

Customer: Perfect. And what was the price again? Just want to make sure I have it right.

Agent: So $119.99 per month for your first year, and then it'll go to our standard rate of $129.99 after that.

Customer: Okay, great. And I'll get some kind of confirmation or anything?

Agent: Absolutely. We'll send you an email confirmation within the next hour, and you'll also see the changes reflected in your online account portal. If you ever need to check your speed or have any issues, you can always log in there.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: (pause) I don't think so, but let me just... no, I think we're all good. Just one quick thing—we do have 24/7 customer support if you run into any issues after the upgrade goes live, and you can reach us at the number on your bill or through the website.

Customer: Great, thanks so much.

Agent: You're welcome, David. Thank you for upgrading with us, and we really appreciate your business. You have a great day now.

Customer: You too, thanks again.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
