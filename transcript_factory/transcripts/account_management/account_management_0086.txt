Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've got the 100 megabit plan right now, and honestly it's just not cutting it anymore. My kids are doing online school and my wife's working from home, and we're all fighting over bandwidth constantly.

Agent: I totally understand. That's something we hear a lot, especially with multiple people using the internet at the same time. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, or the service address?

Customer: Sure, it's 542 Maple Street in... uh... Bend, Oregon. 97701.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. So you're currently on our 100 Mbps fiber plan. And you mentioned multiple people are using it simultaneously? What kind of activities are they doing online? That'll help me figure out what speed would work best for you.

Customer: Well, like I said, the kids are in middle school doing Zoom classes, and my wife does a lot of video conferencing for her marketing job. Then I'm usually streaming something in the background, or working on email. We've been getting lag and buffering a lot lately.

Agent: Yeah, that makes sense. So with video conferencing and online schooling, you're really looking at... (pause) ...I'd recommend at least our 400 Mbps plan, honestly. That'll give you plenty of headroom so nobody's competing for bandwidth. We also have a gig plan—that's 1 gigabit—if you want to future-proof yourself.

Customer: How much more is the gig plan compared to what I'm paying now?

Agent: Let me see what you're currently paying. (typing sounds) Okay, so you're at $79.99 a month for the 100 Mbps. The 400 Mbps plan would be $119.99, and the gig plan is $149.99 a month.

Customer: Wow, that's... (pause) ...that's pretty steep. What's the difference between the 400 and the gig? Like, would I really notice it?

Agent: That's a fair question. Honestly, for what you're doing, the 400 plan would probably be sufficient. The gig plan is more if you're doing a lot of large file transfers, uploading videos, or if you want maximum future-proofing. For video conferencing, streaming, and schooling, 400 is really solid. But the good news is... (pause) ...are you currently in a contract with us?

Customer: Uh, I don't think so? We've been with Frontier for like three years.

Agent: Okay, great. So I can actually apply a promotion to your account. If you upgrade to the 400 plan today, I can get you locked in at $99.99 for the first 12 months instead of the regular $119.99. That saves you $20 a month for a year.

Customer: Oh, okay, that's better. (pause) So that would be $99.99 for the first year, and then it goes up to...?

Agent: To the regular $119.99 after the promotional period ends. But you can always call us back before that year is up, and we can look at options to keep your rate competitive. We like to take care of our long-term customers.

Customer: Alright, that sounds reasonable. What about installation? Do I need a tech to come out?

Agent: Good question. So, you're already getting fiber to your home since you're on our 100 Mbps plan, which is great. For the speed upgrade, we actually don't need to send a technician. It's just a configuration change on our end and we'll ship you a new modem that's capable of handling the higher speeds. You'll get it in about 3 to 5 business days, and the setup is pretty straightforward. There's instructions in the box, and our support line is available if you have any issues.

Customer: So I just replace the modem myself?

Agent: Exactly. You'll unplug the old one, plug in the new one, and it should activate automatically. It usually takes about five to ten minutes to fully boot up and connect. If you run into any trouble, we're here 24/7.

Customer: Okay, that works for me. Let's do it.

Agent: Awesome! (typing sounds) So to confirm, I'm upgrading you from the 100 Mbps fiber plan to the 400 Mbps fiber plan. That's $99.99 a month for 12 months, then $119.99 after that. Is that correct?

Customer: Yep, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, the upgrade is processing now. You should see a confirmation email within the next couple minutes. Your new modem will ship out today and should arrive by... (pause) ...Wednesday or Thursday of next week. The change in your billing will start on your next billing cycle, which is... (more typing) ...looks like the 15th.

Customer: Great. And I'll definitely notice a difference, right? Like, it's not gonna be some tiny improvement?

Agent: (chuckles) No, you'll definitely feel the difference. Going from 100 to 400, especially with your situation with multiple users, you should see way less buffering, faster downloads, and a much smoother experience overall. Your video calls should be crystal clear with no lag.

Customer: Okay, awesome. I appreciate it, Marcus.

Agent: Of course! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and enjoy that faster internet. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
