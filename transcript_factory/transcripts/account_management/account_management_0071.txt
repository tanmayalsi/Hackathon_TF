Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I've been a customer for about three years now and I'm thinking about upgrading my internet. My current speed just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause, typing) Perfect, I've got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our 100 megabit per second plan. What kind of speeds are you looking for, and what's prompting the upgrade? Working from home more, streaming... (background noise) ...excuse me, one second.

Customer: Yeah, actually both. I started a remote job about four months ago and my partner's been streaming a lot more too. Plus we've got Ring cameras now, and honestly, things just buffer constantly. It's really frustrating.

Agent: I totally understand. That actually sounds like you might have multiple devices competing for bandwidth. The good news is, we have some great options available at your address. You're in a fiber-service area, which means you could potentially go up to our gigabit plan. That's one thousand megs per second, so you'd have plenty of bandwidth for everything you're doing.

Customer: Wow, okay. That sounds... I mean, that's a huge jump. What's the difference in price?

Agent: So your current plan is $69.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: (typing) Alright, so our one-gig plan is typically $109.99 a month. However, we do have a promotion running right now for existing customers. We can do $89.99 for the first year, and then it goes to the regular rate after that. Plus, we'd waive the installation fee, which would save you $99 right there.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so it'd be $89.99 for the first twelve months?

Agent: That's correct. And just to be clear, that's the promotional rate for existing customers. It's a pretty solid deal. After that first year, it would be $109.99 per month, but you'd still have the option to check for promotions or adjust your service at that time.

Customer: Right, right. And the installation... do you guys have to come out and actually do anything? I'd rather not have someone at the house right now if I don't have to.

Agent: That's a fair question. Since you're already on our fiber network, the upgrade is typically pretty straightforward. We'd just need to push an update to your modem and router, and honestly, a lot of customers can do that themselves with a simple reset. But if you want to be safe, our technician can come out and ensure everything's properly configured. It usually takes about an hour, and we can schedule it at your convenience.

Customer: If I do it myself, you're saying I just restart the modem?

Agent: Essentially, yes. We'd send you an email with instructions. You'd power cycle your equipment—that's unplug it, wait about thirty seconds, and plug it back in. Your speeds should update automatically. That said, if you're not comfortable doing that or if you want someone to verify everything's working optimally, we can definitely send a technician out.

Customer: No, I think I can handle that. Let's skip the technician visit.

Agent: Perfect. (typing) So just to recap, we're upgrading you from our 100 meg plan to our gigabit plan at $89.99 per month for the first year. Installation fee waived. You'll receive an email with setup instructions, and the upgrade should be active within 24 hours.

Customer: That's great. When does this promotion end, by the way?

Agent: The promotion is valid through the end of this month, so you're in good shape. Now, I do want to mention—are you renting your modem from us right now, or do you have your own equipment?

Customer: I'm renting. I think... yeah, it's the Frontier-provided one.

Agent: Okay, so you shouldn't need to purchase anything. The modem you have should support the gigabit speeds, so you're all set on that front. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. When will this take effect?

Agent: I'll process this right now for you. (typing, pause) Alright, so your new plan is active as of today. You should see the change reflected on your next bill, which would be in... (pause) ...about two weeks from now. In the meantime, you'll get that email with instructions within the next hour or so.

Customer: Excellent. Thank you so much, Marcus. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer, and I'm sure you'll really enjoy those faster speeds. If you have any trouble with the reset or if anything doesn't seem right, just give us a call back and we'll get you taken care of.

Customer: Will do. Have a great day.

Agent: You too. Thanks for calling Frontier. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
