Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I want to upgrade my internet. I've had the same plan for like... three years now, and it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you calling in! I'd be happy to help you with that. Before we get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 2834 Maple Street?

Customer: That's right, yeah.

Agent: Great! So I'm pulling up your account here. I see you're currently on our Frontier 100 plan at $59.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. Um, honestly, I'm doing a lot more streaming now, and my family's been complaining that it keeps buffering. My kid's also been taking online classes from home, so we really need something faster.

Agent: I completely understand. Video calls and streaming can really add up in terms of bandwidth usage. (pause) So what kind of speeds would you be looking for? Are you familiar with our different tier options?

Customer: Not really, no. I mean, I know 100 is... 100 megabits? But that should be fast enough, right?

Agent: So 100 megabits is definitely a solid baseline, but if you've got multiple devices going at once—streaming, video conferencing, that sort of thing—it can definitely get congested. We have a few options. Our next tier up is Frontier 300, which gives you 300 megabits down, and that's $79.99 a month. Then we also have Frontier Gig, which is our gigabit service at $99.99 a month.

Customer: Wow, okay. So what's the difference between 300 and the gig one? I mean, do I really need that much?

Agent: That's a fair question. (typing sounds) For most households with maybe two or three people streaming at once and someone working from home, the 300 plan works really well. The Gig plan is more if you're a heavy user—multiple people video conferencing, gaming, large file downloads, that kind of thing. How many people are typically using the internet at the same time in your home?

Customer: There's four of us. My husband, me, our two kids. So yeah, there's usually... there's a lot going on.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so with four people, I'd probably recommend our Frontier 300 plan. That's a really good middle ground, and you should see a pretty significant improvement over what you're experiencing now. Plus, we're actually running a promotion right now where you can get Frontier 300 for $69.99 a month for the first 12 months. After that, it would be $79.99.

Customer: Oh, really? (pause) That's actually not that much more than what I'm paying now. That sounds good. What about installation? Do I have to schedule someone to come out?

Agent: Great question. Since you already have fiber to your home, the upgrade is actually pretty simple. We can send you a new gateway—that's the modem and router combined—and you can do a self-install, which would take maybe 15, 20 minutes. Or, if you'd prefer to have a technician come out and handle it, we can schedule that for you as well. There would be a $99 installation fee for the technician visit, but self-install is completely free.

Customer: How long would it take for everything to be set up if I do it myself?

Agent: Like I said, probably 15 to 20 minutes. You'd unplug your current gateway, plug in the new one, and once it boots up, you're good to go. It's pretty straightforward. And you'd get an email with instructions and a link to set everything up.

Customer: Yeah, no, I can handle that. I'll do the self-install.

Agent: Perfect! (typing sounds) Okay, so just to confirm what we're setting up here: you're upgrading from Frontier 100 to Frontier 300. The promotional rate is $69.99 for the first 12 months, then $79.99 after that. There's no installation fee since you're doing the self-install. We'll ship out your new gateway, and you should receive it within two to three business days. Does that all sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds great. Um, one more thing though—will I have any downtime? Like, will my internet go out while I'm switching over?

Agent: Good thinking! So when you make the switch, you'll have a brief interruption—maybe two to five minutes—while the new gateway is booting up and connecting to our network. But once it's online, you're all set. I'd recommend picking a time when you don't need internet for anything critical.

Customer: Okay, got it. That's fine.

Agent: Awesome. (pause) And I'm going to add a note here that you're doing self-install, so you won't be charged the technician fee. Your new equipment ships out today, and you'll get a tracking number via email within the next hour or so.

Customer: Great. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope! Just keep an eye out for that email with the tracking info, and when your equipment arrives, just follow the instructions. If you run into any issues during setup, just give us a call back and we'll walk you through it. We're available 24/7.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you so much for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! I really appreciate you choosing Frontier. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks again!

Agent: Have a great day, and thanks again for calling Frontier!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye now!
