Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm currently a customer and I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. I've got the 100 meg plan right now and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. We've actually expanded our offerings quite a bit. I'd be happy to help you find something that works better for your needs. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, sure. It's area code 503... 555... actually, let me find my bill here. Hold on one second.

Agent: No problem, take your time.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, here we go. It's 503-555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. And just to confirm, is this for service at... 2241 Riverside Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's the one.

Agent: Great. So I'm seeing here you've been with us for about three years on our Fiber 100 plan. That's awesome. And you mentioned you're looking to upgrade?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I started working from home full-time about six months ago, and honestly, the 100 megs isn't enough anymore. My video calls are lagging, uploads are taking forever... My wife streams while I'm in meetings sometimes, and everything just slows to a crawl.

Agent: Oh man, yeah, that's definitely frustrating. Good news is, we've got some great options for you. With Fiber, you can go up to 500 megs, or we also have our gigabit plan at 1 gig if you want maximum speed and reliability.

Customer: Oh wow, okay. Um... what's the difference in price?

Agent: So your current plan is $59.99 a month. Our Fiber 500 plan would be $89.99 per month, and the Fiber Gig would run you $119.99. But actually, we're running a promotion right now for existing customers upgrading, so I could get you the 500 plan at $79.99 for the first twelve months.

Customer: Oh, that's... that's actually not bad. (pause) Do you think the 500 would be enough for two people working and streaming?

Agent: In most cases, absolutely. I mean, the 500 plan gives you plenty of headroom. It's great for multiple HD streams, large file uploads, video conferencing—all that happening at the same time. But honestly, if you can swing it, the gig plan really future-proofs you. It's only another thirty a month after the promotional period ends.

Customer: Hmm, I don't know. I'm trying to not go too crazy here. The 500 seems like it'd be solid. What about the installation? Would I need a technician to come out?

Agent: Great question. So, the nice thing is, you're already on Fiber, so we can actually do this upgrade remotely in most cases. We'd just need to swap out your modem for a newer one that can handle the faster speeds, and you'd have a tech come out... actually, let me check the exact timeline here. (typing sounds) Yeah, we could have someone out there as early as tomorrow, or we can schedule it for later in the week if that works better for you.

Customer: Tomorrow? Really? That's... wow, that's faster than I expected.

Agent: We try to take care of our valued customers. (slight chuckle) So would tomorrow work, or would you prefer another day?

Customer: Tomorrow's actually perfect. I'm working from home anyway, so that's fine. What time frame are we looking at?

Agent: (typing sounds) It looks like we have an 8 AM to 12 PM window available. Does that work?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. Morning's good for me.

Agent: Perfect. Now, just so you're aware, there's a standard $99 installation fee for the upgrade. But with this promotional pricing, I can actually waive that for you as a loyalty credit since you've been with us for three years.

Customer: Oh, nice! I appreciate that.

Agent: Of course. So let me just walk through what we're setting up here. We're upgrading you from the Fiber 100 plan to the Fiber 500 plan at the promotional rate of $79.99 per month for the first twelve months, then it'll move to $89.99. The installation fee is waived. And we'll have a technician out tomorrow morning between 8 and noon to install the new modem. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds great. Um, just one more thing—is there anything I need to do on my end before the tech arrives?

Agent: Good question. Really, just make sure someone's home to let them in. The tech will handle pretty much everything else. They might need a few minutes to get the modem set up and test the speeds on their end. Oh, and if you have any devices connected to your WiFi, you might want to make sure they're not doing heavy downloads right during the installation, just to give the tech a clean line to work with.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. I'll keep that in mind.

Agent: Excellent. And hey, you should start seeing those speed improvements pretty much immediately once everything's installed and activated. Any other questions for me today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help.

Agent: Absolutely, my pleasure. Just to recap one more time—we've got you scheduled for tomorrow 8 to noon at your Riverside Drive location. Your confirmation number is [inaudible]... sorry, let me spell that out for you. It's 447-FRN-B2K9. We'll also send that to you via email and text to make sure you've got all the details.

Customer: Perfect, thanks again.

Agent: You got it. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
