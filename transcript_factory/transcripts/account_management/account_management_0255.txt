Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm looking to upgrade my internet service. I've got the 100 meg plan right now, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I completely understand. We've definitely seen a lot of customers in that situation. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account to pull up your information?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 2847 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So I've got you here. I see you're currently on our 100 megabit per second plan. What's prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, or...?

Customer: Ah, well, my family's grown. We've got my two kids doing remote learning now, and my wife and I are both working from home. So we've got like... I don't know, four or five devices streaming at once sometimes. The internet just keeps getting bogged down. We're getting buffering, lag spikes during video calls, the whole nine yards.

Agent: Yeah, that makes sense. Four or five devices on the same connection will definitely strain a 100 meg connection, especially with video conferencing and streaming involved. So let me ask you—what would your usage look like? Are we talking constant streaming, or more throughout the day?

Customer: Mostly throughout the day. My kids have school from like nine to three, so there's video conferencing happening then. And then after school, they're doing homework, watching YouTube, that kind of thing. And my wife works in marketing, so she's got meetings constantly.

Agent: Got it. (pause) Based on what you're describing, I'd recommend moving up to our 500 megabit plan. That'll give you plenty of bandwidth for multiple video calls, streaming, and everything else happening at the same time. We also have a gigabit option if you want the absolute top tier, but honestly, for your situation, the 500 meg should be solid.

Customer: Okay, so what's the price difference? I'm currently paying... I think it's like 79 a month? What would that bump up to?

Agent: Let me check your current promotional rate here. (typing sounds) So you're right, you're at $79 a month for the 100 meg plan. The 500 meg plan would be $119 a month.

Customer: Ouch. That's... that's almost 50 bucks more.

Agent: I hear you. But actually, let me see what we have available for new upgrade pricing. (pause) Okay, so I can get you on a promotional rate for the 500 meg plan at $99 a month for the first 12 months. After that, it would go to the regular $119, but you'd have the option to... you know, call back and see if there are any other promos running.

Customer: Hmm, so $99. What's the commitment on that?

Agent: It's a one-year term, so we'd need you locked in for 12 months. But if you want to think about it differently, you're looking at paying an extra $20 a month for, you know, pretty much unlimited usage without the buffering and the slowdowns. Most customers find it's totally worth it.

Customer: Yeah, that's fair. Um, and the equipment—would I need a new modem or router or anything?

Agent: That's a great question. With the 500 meg plan, your current modem should actually handle it just fine. Your router might start to become a limitation if it's pretty old, but the modem you've got should be good to go.

Customer: Okay, okay. How long would it take to activate? Like, would there be any downtime?

Agent: Great news there. We can actually push this upgrade to your account right now, and it'll be active within the next 24 hours. There shouldn't be any downtime at all. You might experience a brief moment where things reset—maybe a minute or two—but that's it.

Customer: [inaudible] ... that works. Yeah, let's do it.

Agent: Awesome. So just to recap, I'm upgrading you from the 100 meg plan at $79 a month to the 500 meg plan at $99 a month for the first 12 months. After 12 months, it would go to $119 unless you're able to sign up for another promotion. Does that sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. What happens with my bill? Do I get a new invoice or...?

Agent: You'll see the change reflected on your next billing cycle. You'll get an updated invoice showing the new rate and the service upgrade. We'll also send you an email confirmation of these changes. Your account number is 555-0147, so you can always check your account online on our website or through the mobile app.

Customer: Perfect. And I don't have to do anything on my end, right? Like, I don't have to restart anything or call back?

Agent: Nope, you're all set. The upgrade will process automatically. But if for some reason you don't see the speed improvement within 24 hours, just give us a call back and we can troubleshoot. But I'm confident you'll notice a huge difference once this kicks in.

Customer: Great, I appreciate that. Oh, one more thing—is there anything I should know about, like, is there a data cap or anything?

Agent: No data caps on any of our plans. You can use as much as you want. That's one of the nice things about fiber.

Customer: Oh nice. Okay, I think I'm good then. Thanks for your help, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and I hope this really improves your internet experience at home. If you need anything else down the road, don't hesitate to give us a call.

Customer: Will do. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Take care!
