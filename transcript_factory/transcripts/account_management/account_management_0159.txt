Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. I've got the 100 meg plan right now, and it's just... it's not cutting it anymore, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. We've definitely seen more people needing faster speeds these days with streaming and working from home and all that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, or the email you use with us?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, and just for verification, what's the last name on the account?

Customer: Martinez. M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z.

Agent: Great, got it. Okay, so I'm looking at your account now. You're currently on our Fiber 100 plan. Can I ask what's prompting the upgrade? Are you having any issues with your current speed, or just need more bandwidth?

Customer: Well, my daughter just started doing online school, and then my wife and I are both working from home now. So we've got three people trying to use video calls, and when someone's downloading something or streaming Netflix in the background... (laughs) it just gets pretty choppy, you know? It's frustrating.

Agent: (laughs) Oh man, yeah, that's the perfect storm right there. Multiple video calls and streaming is definitely going to max out 100 megs pretty quick. So here's what I can tell you — we have some great options for you. We can upgrade you to our Fiber 300 plan, or if you want to really future-proof yourself, we have Fiber 500. Both are available in your area since you're already on our fiber network.

Customer: Okay, so what's the difference in price? Like, what am I looking at monthly?

Agent: (typing) So your current plan is $69.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Alright, so the Fiber 300 would be $89.99 a month, and the Fiber 500 is $119.99 a month. But here's the thing — I actually have a promotion running through the end of the month. If you upgrade today, I can lock you in at $84.99 for the Fiber 300 for the first twelve months. So you'd save five bucks a month.

Customer: Oh, okay, that's not too bad actually. And that's for a year?

Agent: Yep, twelve months at that promotional rate, and then it goes to the regular price after that. I can also waive the upgrade fee for you, which is normally $99, so that's an additional savings right there.

Customer: That's pretty good. Um, and the 300 speed — you think that'll be enough for three people working and streaming at the same time?

Agent: Absolutely. Three hundred megs is plenty for multiple video conference calls simultaneously, plus streaming 4K content. You'd have to really work at it to max that out. Unless you're doing something crazy like large file transfers or heavy gaming, you should be in really good shape.

Customer: No, nothing like that. Okay, I think the Fiber 300 sounds good. How fast can you get that set up?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great choice! So the good news is since you're already on our fiber network, this is just a provisioning change on our end. I can have that activated as soon as tomorrow morning. Do you want me to go ahead and get that processed for you?

Customer: Yeah, tomorrow works. That's perfect.

Agent: Awesome. So let me just confirm the details here. We're upgrading you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300. The new rate is $84.99 a month for the first twelve months, promotional rate. No upgrade fee. And the change will be effective tomorrow, starting at midnight. Your service should transition over automatically — you shouldn't experience any downtime, but I'd recommend restarting your modem around one or two AM just to make sure everything syncs up properly.

Customer: Okay, restart the modem tomorrow night. Got it. And the bill... when does that change kick in?

Agent: The new rate will be reflected on your next billing cycle. Your current bill cycle ends on the 22nd, so you'll see the new rate starting on your March statement. And just so you have it, I'm sending you a confirmation email with all the details of this upgrade, and you can also check your account online anytime to see the changes.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope, you're all set! We'll take care of everything on our end. Just restart that modem tomorrow night, and by morning you should be good to go with your new speeds. Your speeds should be noticeably faster right away, so you and your family should have a much better experience with the video calls and everything else.

Customer: Awesome, Derek. I really appreciate your help.

Agent: Happy to help! Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and let us know if you have any issues at all. You can reach us anytime at the number on your bill, or just dial 611 from your home phone. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day, and thanks again for choosing Frontier.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
