Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I've been a customer for about three years now, and I'm looking to upgrade my internet speed. My current plan just isn't cutting it anymore.

Agent: I appreciate you calling in! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing your account. You're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I think I'm paying like seventy-nine ninety-nine a month for it?

Agent: That sounds about right. And what's prompting the upgrade? Are you experiencing any speed issues, or...?

Customer: Well, my wife and I are both working from home now, and we're constantly uploading files, doing video calls. Plus, my kids are streaming stuff on their tablets, and it just feels slow. We'll have like three or four things going at once and everything starts buffering.

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally get that. With multiple users and those kinds of activities, a hundred megabits is definitely going to feel limited. (pause) So we have a couple of great options for you. We can upgrade you to our Fiber 300 plan, or if you want even more headroom, we have Fiber 500. Are you familiar with those speeds?

Customer: Not really, no. What's the price difference?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so your Fiber 100 is currently $79.99. The Fiber 300 would be $119.99 per month, so that's a forty dollar increase. And then the Fiber 500 is $149.99.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) What's the actual difference between the 300 and the 500? Like, will I really notice it?

Agent: Great question. So honestly, for what you're describing—work calls, file uploads, streaming on multiple devices—the Fiber 300 is going to be a really solid choice. You'll have plenty of bandwidth so everyone can do their thing without that buffering you're experiencing. The Fiber 500 is really more if you're doing heavy data work like video editing or you've got like, eight or nine people using the connection simultaneously.

Customer: Right, okay. So you think the 300 would be enough?

Agent: I do, yeah. I think you'd see a huge improvement from the 100 to the 300. It's basically three times the speed, so... (pause) Plus, I should mention—are you still under contract with us, or are you month-to-month?

Customer: I think I'm month-to-month now. My contract ended, I dunno, maybe a year ago?

Agent: Perfect, that actually works in your favor. So with month-to-month, there's no commitment. You can upgrade to the Fiber 300 and if for some reason it's not what you need, you can always change it later. And I can actually get you a promotional rate on this.

Customer: Oh, really? How much?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what I have available... (pause) So normally it's $119.99, but I can do $99.99 for your first twelve months. After that, it goes to the regular rate.

Customer: Oh, that's not bad. So it's only a twenty dollar increase for the first year?

Agent: Exactly. Yeah, only twenty dollars more than what you're paying now.

Customer: (pause) That sounds good. And how soon could that take effect?

Agent: We can actually activate that for you today. The speeds should be updated in the next twenty-four to forty-eight hours. You shouldn't need a technician visit or anything—it's all backend stuff. Your modem will automatically handle the new speed tier.

Customer: Oh nice, I don't have to take time off work or anything?

Agent: Nope, you're good. No technician needed. (typing sounds) So let me just go ahead and process this upgrade for you. Can I confirm the service address on file? I'm showing 4521 Oakmont Drive, that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Awesome. And the primary contact number, that's... (pause) ...555-0147?

Customer: Yes, that's my cell.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to apply the promotional rate, the Fiber 300 plan, and this is effective immediately. You should see the speed increase by tomorrow, but definitely within forty-eight hours. Your next bill will reflect the new rate starting next month.

Customer: Great. Is there anything else I need to do on my end?

Agent: Nope, all set. You might notice your modem cycles or restarts at some point—that's totally normal. (pause) Um, I'll send a confirmation email to the address we have on file, and that'll have all the details of your upgrade, the new rate, everything.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks so much, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: Of course! I'm glad we could get you set up. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. We'll see how this works out.

Agent: Sounds good. Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being a loyal customer. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
