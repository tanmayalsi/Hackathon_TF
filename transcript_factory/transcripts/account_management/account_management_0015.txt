Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet service. I currently have the 100 megabit plan, and honestly, it's just not cutting it anymore.

Agent: I understand. We'd be happy to help you with an upgrade. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And your name?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Great, David. Thanks for that. Okay, I'm seeing here that you're currently on our Fiber 100 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. We've had it for about three years now, and it was fine at first, but my kids are doing remote schooling, my wife's working from home, and we're all streaming stuff. It's just... it's become a bottleneck, you know?

Agent: Oh, I completely get that. Especially with multiple users on the network simultaneously. That can definitely cause slowdowns. (pause) So what kind of speeds are you looking to upgrade to? We have several options available in your area.

Customer: Um, I'm not entirely sure. What do you recommend? I mean, nothing crazy expensive, but something that'll actually handle everything we're doing.

Agent: Well, that depends on your usage, but I'd say for a household like yours—multiple people streaming, video calls, remote work—I'd recommend our Fiber 300 plan at minimum. That gives you 300 megabits download and 150 upload. We also have Fiber 500, which is 500 down and 250 up, if you want something more future-proof.

Customer: Hmm, how much more is the 500?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check the current promotional rates. (pause) Okay, so the Fiber 300 is $89.99 a month for the first year, then it goes to regular price after that, which is $119.99. The Fiber 500 is $109.99 for the first year, then $149.99 after.

Customer: Oh, wait. It goes up after the first year?

Agent: Yes, that's our standard promotional pricing. The first-year rate is locked in, but after that, it reverts to our standard pricing. However, you know, many customers are able to call back and negotiate when their promo ends. It's definitely worth doing. (chuckles)

Customer: Okay, that's... I mean, it's pretty typical, I guess. What about installation? Do I have to pay anything for that?

Agent: Great question. Since you're an existing customer, we can actually do a free professional installation, or if you prefer, we can send you a self-install kit at no charge. With your current setup, we'd just need to upgrade your modem and router to support the higher speeds.

Customer: How long would professional installation take?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what's available in your area. (pause) Looks like we have appointments available next Thursday between 1 and 5 PM, or the following Monday morning between 9 AM and noon.

Customer: Next Thursday works for me. Afternoon is better though.

Agent: Perfect. I can schedule that for Thursday between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will arrive with the new equipment and have everything up and running in about an hour, hour and a half typically. They'll test everything out before they leave, so you'll be good to go.

Customer: That's great. Um, so if I go with the 300, and just to confirm—that's $89.99 for the first year?

Agent: That's correct. $89.99 per month for twelve months, then it adjusts to the regular rate after that. And that includes the modem and router rental as well.

Customer: Okay, and I can upgrade my current plan to the 300, right? I don't have to... like, switch to a new account or anything?

Agent: No, no, we'll just upgrade your existing account. Super easy. Your account number stays the same, your billing address, all of that stays the same. We're just upgrading your service tier. (pause) So just to summarize what we're doing here: I'm going to upgrade you from Fiber 100 to Fiber 300, $89.99 per month for the first year, with free professional installation next Thursday afternoon. Does that all sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Can I ask one more thing though?

Agent: Of course, go ahead.

Customer: Is there any kind of contract I have to sign? Like, am I locked in for a certain amount of time?

Agent: Good question. This is a month-to-month service, so there's no long-term contract required. You can change or cancel anytime. The only thing is, if you cancel within the first year, we can't honor that promotional pricing if you come back later, but there's no early termination fee or anything like that.

Customer: Oh, that's actually really good. I appreciate that. Okay, I think I'm ready to go ahead.

Agent: Awesome! (typing sounds) Let me just process this upgrade for you. (pause) I'm going to need to confirm the service address one more time. You're at 742 Maple Street, Apartment 3B?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. (more typing sounds) Alright, David, the upgrade is all processed. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes. Your installation is scheduled for Thursday, April 16th between 1 and 5 PM. The technician will call you about 30 minutes before they arrive. Is the phone number we have on file the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. Just to prepare, make sure someone's home to let the technician in, and if you have any devices connected to your current router, you might want to note those down so you can reconnect them after we set up the new equipment.

Customer: Will I have to do that, or will the technician handle it?

Agent: The technician will help you get set up, but if you have like smart home devices or gaming consoles, anything like that, you might want to know the passwords beforehand so you can reconnect them easily.

Customer: Okay, good tip. Thank you for that.

Agent: You're very welcome, David. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. This was really helpful, thanks so much.

Agent: My pleasure! Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You're going to love those speeds. Enjoy!

Customer: Thanks, have a good one.

Agent: You too, David. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
