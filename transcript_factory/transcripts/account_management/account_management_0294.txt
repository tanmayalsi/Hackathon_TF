Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm currently on the 500 megabit plan, and honestly, I'm thinking about upgrading. My internet's been pretty good, but I work from home now and I could use something faster.

Agent: Oh, that's great! I'd be happy to help you explore some upgrade options. Just to pull up your account here... (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, or the email address you use with us?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, I've got you here. So I can see you're on our Fiber Gig 500 plan. That's a solid plan. What kind of speeds are you looking to upgrade to? Are you interested in our Gig plan, or maybe going all the way up to our 2-gig service?

Customer: Um, so what's the difference? Like, how much faster is the gig plan compared to what I have now?

Agent: Great question. So your current plan gives you 500 megabits per second. Our Gig plan—that's our Fiber Gig 1000—would double that to 1000 megabits, or one gigabit. Then we also have the Fiber Gig 2000, which is two gigabits, but that's really more for heavy users with a lot of devices or... you know, if you're streaming 4K on multiple TVs at the same time, that kind of thing.

Customer: Hmm, okay. I mean, I work from home doing a lot of video calls and uploading files to the cloud, so I think the regular gig would probably be good. What would that cost me?

Agent: (typing) Okay, so for the Fiber Gig 1000, I'm showing we have a promotional rate right now. It would be $79.99 per month for the first 12 months, and then it goes to the standard rate of $99.99 after that.

Customer: Oh, so it goes up after a year?

Agent: Yeah, that's the promotional pricing. However, at the end of your promotional period, you'd be welcome to call back, and we can usually work something out for you. A lot of our customers have been able to maintain promotional pricing or find other offers.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. And how long would it take to, like, actually get upgraded? Do I need a technician to come out or...?

Agent: (pause) That's a good question. Since you're already on fiber, we can actually do a remote upgrade in most cases. Let me just check your service address here... (typing sounds) Yeah, I'm showing that your line supports the upgrade without needing a technician visit. We can get that pushed through today, and it should be active within about 24 hours. You might experience a brief service interruption—maybe 5 to 10 minutes—when we make the switch, but typically that happens late at night so it won't affect you.

Customer: Oh wow, okay, that's way better than I thought. So I wouldn't have to take time off work or anything?

Agent: Exactly, no. We'll schedule it for off-hours. The only thing is, you might want to restart your router once the upgrade goes through, just to make sure everything's running optimally. But honestly, most customers don't even notice the changeover.

Customer: That's perfect. I think I'm ready to do it. Let's go ahead and upgrade.

Agent: (typing) Awesome! Let me just confirm everything with you before we finalize this. So we're upgrading from your current Fiber Gig 500 to the Fiber Gig 1000, promotional rate of $79.99 per month for 12 months. Your account email is [inaudible], is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And just to let you know, your first bill will reflect the new rate starting next billing cycle. You shouldn't see any charges today since we're just processing the upgrade. (pause) Okay, I've gone ahead and submitted this for you. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour, and then the upgrade will process within 24 hours.

Customer: Great, that's awesome. Thank you so much, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm excited to get the faster speeds.

Agent: Excellent! Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. If you have any issues with the upgrade or anything else in the future, don't hesitate to give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks again!

Agent: Bye now!
