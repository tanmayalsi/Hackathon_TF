Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'd like to upgrade my internet service. I've been with you guys for... I think it's been about three years now?

Agent: Great! I'm happy to help you with that. Before we get started, can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 412 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Wonderful. So I'm looking here at your current plan. You're on our Frontier Fiber 100 package, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. And honestly, it's been pretty good, but I'm working from home now and my roommate is always streaming stuff, so... I mean, it's getting a little slow sometimes during peak hours. I'm thinking I need something faster.

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually really common with multiple users on the network. (pause) So what kind of speeds were you looking at? Are you interested in our Fiber 200, or were you thinking something even faster?

Customer: Um, I'm not really sure what would be best. What's the difference? And how much more would it cost?

Agent: Good question. So your current Fiber 100 gives you 100 megabits per second download speeds. Our Fiber 200 doubles that to 200 Mbps, which is... (pause) honestly perfect for working from home plus streaming. Then we also have Fiber 500 and our top tier, Fiber 1-Gig, which is 1,000 Mbps if you really want to future-proof yourself.

Customer: Okay, so what's the price jump from where I am now?

Agent: (typing sounds) So let me pull up your current rate. Looks like you're at $59.99 a month for the Fiber 100. If you upgrade to Fiber 200, that would be $79.99 monthly. Fiber 500 is $119.99, and the Fiber 1-Gig is $149.99.

Customer: Wow, okay. (pause) That's quite a jump. What about like... taxes and fees and all that stuff? Does that get added on top?

Agent: Great question. So that price I quoted is the service rate, and then yes, there would be taxes and a few other fees. Your total bill would probably be somewhere around $95 to $98 for the Fiber 200, depending on your specific area and any promotional fees. But actually... (pause) let me see if I can find you a promotion here because you've been such a loyal customer. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing I can offer you the Fiber 200 at $69.99 for the first year, which would bring your total to around $85 monthly with taxes.

Customer: Oh, that's better! So for a year though, right? Then it goes up?

Agent: Yes, exactly. So you'd have that rate locked in for twelve months, and then after that it goes to the regular $79.99. But honestly, you can always call back in before that contract ends and we can look at what specials we might have at that time.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. I think that could work. But... I just want to make sure the speeds will actually be better. Like, what am I actually going to notice?

Agent: (pause) That's a fair question. So with Fiber 200, you're basically doubling your download speeds. In practical terms, if you're downloading a large file, it'll take half as long. Streaming is gonna be smoother, especially if multiple people are using it. Working from home with video calls and uploads is gonna be noticeably faster. Honestly, for your situation with you and your roommate, I think this is the sweet spot.

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. How... how fast is the installation? Can I get it done like, this week?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me pull up our availability. What day works best for you?

Customer: Um, I'm off on Thursday and Friday. Either of those is fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm showing we have availability this Thursday, September 14th, between 8 AM and noon, or we have Friday afternoon between 1 and 5 PM. Which would you prefer?

Customer: Thursday morning is better for me. The earlier the better, honestly.

Agent: Excellent. So I'm gonna schedule you for Thursday, September 14th. Our technician will arrive between 8 AM and noon. The installation itself usually takes about an hour and a half, sometimes a little longer depending on what we need to do at your location.

Customer: Okay, and... do I need to do anything to prepare or anything?

Agent: Nothing major. Just make sure there's clear access to where your router is currently set up, and if you have any pets, maybe just keep them in another room so the technician has space to work. They'll bring all the equipment they need, so you're all set.

Customer: Sounds good. So I'm all set then? When do I need to pay or...?

Agent: So the installation is free with your upgrade, which is great. Your new rate will start on your next billing cycle, which looks like it'll be October 1st. You'll see the new charges reflected on that bill. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that's it. Thank you!

Agent: Perfect! Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your loyalty. You should be receiving a confirmation email shortly with all the details about your Thursday appointment. If you have any questions before then, just give us a call back.

Customer: Great, thanks again. Have a good day.

Agent: You too! Thanks for calling Frontier.
