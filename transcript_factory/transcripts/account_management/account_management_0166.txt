Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, my name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey Marcus, yeah, I'm calling because I'm interested in upgrading my internet. My current speeds just aren't cutting it anymore.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account really quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got you here. So I'm seeing you're currently on our Fiber 200 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Two hundred megs down, right?

Agent: That's right, 200 Mbps download speeds. And how long have you been on that plan?

Customer: Oh man, probably like... three or four years? Maybe longer. Time flies, you know?

Agent: (chuckling) Tell me about it. So what's prompting the upgrade? Are you working from home, or...?

Customer: Actually, yeah. I moved to working from home full-time about six months ago, and I've got my wife and two kids doing remote schooling. So we've got like, a lot of devices on the network now. Video calls, streaming, gaming—it's just gotten really slow and laggy lately.

Agent: Oh yeah, I totally get that. Multiple video streams can really eat up that bandwidth. Well, you're in luck because we've actually got some great options available at your address. We can get you up to Fiber 1 Gig speeds. That's 940 Mbps, and honestly with your situation, that would be a game-changer.

Customer: Wow, okay. That sounds... that's a huge jump. What's the difference in price going to be?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here. So you're currently at $89.99 a month for the Fiber 200. If we upgrade you to the Fiber 1 Gig, it would be $129.99 a month for the first twelve months with our promotional pricing.

Customer: Hmm, so that's like forty bucks more?

Agent: Right, forty dollars more monthly, but you're getting five times the speed. And the promo rate is locked in for a full year, so after that it would adjust to our standard rate, which is $149.99. But you can always call us back before it expires if you want to look at other options.

Customer: That's not too bad, actually. Do I need a new router or anything? I don't really want to deal with installation hassle.

Agent: Great question. The good news is we'll send you our new Wi-Fi 6 gateway at no extra charge. It's a pretty straightforward swap—just unplug the old one and plug in the new one. Most customers have it up and running in like five or ten minutes. We can ship it out to arrive before your service upgrade activates, or we can have a tech do a professional installation if you'd prefer.

Customer: No, I think I can handle plugging something in. (laughs) When could you upgrade me?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check our availability... Okay, so we can have the new gateway shipped out to you by Thursday, and we can schedule the service upgrade for next Monday. Would Monday work for you, or would you prefer a different day?

Customer: Monday works. In the morning would be great if you have it.

Agent: Perfect, I can put you down for Monday between 8 AM and 12 PM. Does that window work?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Excellent. (pause) And just to confirm, I'm not seeing any installation or upgrade fees on this promotion either, so you're all set there. Let me just walk through everything here... We're upgrading you from Fiber 200 to Fiber 1 Gig, $129.99 for the first year, service activation Monday between 8 AM and noon, new gateway shipping Thursday... Do I have all that correct?

Customer: Yep, that sounds right. Oh, one more thing—do I need to do anything with my current router?

Agent: We can definitely pick that up during the installation window, or you can just keep it as a backup. Most people just let us grab it. We'll take care of the recycling.

Customer: Oh, that's convenient. Yeah, just take it.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm getting your confirmation number here... that's going to be 847-FRN-295841. I'm gonna send that to the email on file, which I'm showing as [inaudible]@gmail.com. Is that still the best email for you?

Customer: Actually, can you send it to my work email instead? It's james.patterson.work@...

Agent: Of course, go ahead.

Customer: James—J-A-M-E-S—dot patterson.work@companymail.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've updated that. You'll get all your confirmation details, tracking info for the gateway, and your installation appointment details sent to that address. You should see everything by end of business today.

Customer: Great, I really appreciate it, Marcus. This should help out a lot with everything going on at home.

Agent: Happy to help, James. I think you're gonna see a huge difference once you're on that 1 Gig. And hey, if you have any issues during installation or setup, you can always reach back out to us. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too, take care.

Agent: Bye now.
