Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. So, um, I'm currently on your 300 megabit plan, and I'm thinking I need to upgrade. Things have just been getting slower lately, and I'm working from home most of the time now.

Agent: I completely understand. Working from home definitely puts more demand on your connection. Let me pull up your account here real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Oh sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. And just to confirm, is this for the service at 428 Maple Street?

Customer: Yep, that's the one.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm seeing you've been with us for about three years on that 300 meg plan. That's great. And you're right, with remote work becoming more common, a lot of our customers are finding they need that extra bandwidth. What kinds of activities are you doing that are making things feel sluggish?

Customer: Well, I'm on video calls pretty much all day for work, and my partner, they're working from home too. So we've got two of us streaming video constantly, and then if either of us tries to download anything or... it just gets really choppy. Plus we like to stream Netflix in the evenings, and it's been buffering a lot.

Agent: Yeah, that makes sense. Two simultaneous video streams plus regular browsing can definitely max out a 300 meg connection. The good news is we have some excellent options for you. Our most popular upgrade right now is the 500 megabit plan. That would give you a lot more headroom for everything you're doing.

Customer: Okay, so how much more would that be? I'm currently paying... I think it's like $79 a month?

Agent: (pause, typing) Let me see here... Okay, so your current rate is $79.99 a month. If you upgrade to our 500 meg fiber plan, that would be $119.99 per month. However, I can actually get you a promotional rate right now. I can set you up at $99.99 for the first twelve months, and then it goes to the regular rate after that.

Customer: Hmm, so that's $20 more a month for the first year, then $40 more after that?

Agent: Correct. The first year would be $20 more, and then yes, $40 more after the first year. But I will say, we can usually work with you again when that promotional period ends to get you another rate. We also have a 1 gig plan available if you want to look even further ahead. That's $149.99 a month, or I could do $129.99 for the first year.

Customer: (pause) That's... that's quite a jump. Do you think the 500 would be enough, or...?

Agent: Honestly, for two people working from home with video conferencing and streaming, the 500 should be really solid. A gigabit is more what we'd recommend if you had like four or five people on the connection, or if you were doing a lot of large file transfers, video editing, that kind of thing. For your situation, I think 500 would absolutely handle everything you're describing without any issues.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good then. Can I do the 500? And just out of curiosity, would there be any installation fees or anything like that?

Agent: Great choice. So because you're already an established customer with us, there's no installation fee. We'd just need to come out and potentially swap out your modem to one that supports the higher speeds. That would take about... (pause) typically 30 to 45 minutes. We can schedule that at your convenience. Do you have any availability coming up? We have next-day appointments available in some areas.

Customer: Oh, nice. Um, let me think. This weekend would be good actually. Either Saturday or Sunday works.

Agent: Perfect. Let me check what we have. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm showing availability on Saturday between 8 AM and noon, or we also have a 12 to 4 PM slot. Which would work better for you?

Customer: The 8 to noon slot, that sounds better.

Agent: Excellent. So I have you down for this Saturday, 8 AM to noon, for a service upgrade installation. Before we finalize everything, let me just review the details. You're upgrading from 300 megs to 500 megs. Your promotional rate is $99.99 per month for twelve months. After that, it'll be $119.99. No installation fee. Is there anything else I should know? Do you have any questions for me?

Customer: No, I think that's... wait, actually, one thing. Will my internet go down during the installation? Because if it does, I need to make sure my work doesn't get interrupted.

Agent: That's a good question. So we will need to temporarily power down your modem during the swap, which could take about 5 to 10 minutes. I'd recommend maybe scheduling this for a Saturday morning when you're not working, which it sounds like you're planning to do anyway. So that should be perfect.

Customer: Yeah, that's actually why I said Saturday. (laughs)

Agent: (laughs) Smart thinking. Okay, so we're all set. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the appointment details, and a technician will reach out 24 hours prior with a call to confirm the time window. Is that email still [inaudible@domain.com]?

Customer: Uh, let me think... actually, it might be my older email. Can you double-check what you have on file?

Agent: Of course. I'm showing [inaudible]@gmail.com. Does that sound right?

Customer: Actually, no. It's the same first part, but it's @outlook. Can you update that?

Agent: (typing) Absolutely. Let me get that changed to [inaudible]@outlook. There we go. All updated. You'll get the confirmation sent to that new email address.

Customer: Great, thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. So just to recap one more time, your service upgrade is confirmed for this Saturday, 8 AM to noon, 500 megabit fiber plan at $99.99 per month for the first year. Your account has been updated, and you should see everything reflected in your next billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks so much, Marcus.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You're going to love that extra speed. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
