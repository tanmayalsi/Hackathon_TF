Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, thanks for picking up. So I'm currently on your 300 megabit plan, and honestly, I'm thinking I need something faster. My household is getting pretty crowded now with work-from-home stuff, and my kids are always streaming.

Agent: I totally understand. That's actually something we hear a lot, especially these days. So you're on the 300 meg plan right now?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. We've had it for... I don't know, maybe two years now? And it was fine at first, but now everyone's on video calls simultaneously and it just gets sluggish.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account here. Let me just verify your service address real quick to make sure we have you in the right location. Is that still 4287 Maple Drive in Fresno?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you're looking to upgrade because of bandwidth needs?

Customer: Exactly. Like, my wife's in back-to-back Zoom calls most days, I'm doing the same, and then we've got Netflix running in the living room... It's just too much. I've noticed the connection dropping or getting really slow, you know?

Agent: Yeah, absolutely. So here's the good news—we actually have fiber service to your location, which means you have some really solid options. (pause) Right now we're running a promotion on our higher-tier plans. You could go with our 500 meg package, which honestly might be perfect for your situation, or we also have our gigabit plan if you want to really future-proof yourself.

Customer: What's the pricing difference between those two?

Agent: Great question. So the 500 meg is currently running $69.99 a month, and that's locked in for the first year. The gigabit plan is $89.99 for the first year. After that, both would go up a bit, but you'd be locked in for the promotional pricing during that first year.

Customer: And what's the difference in, like, actual performance? I mean, I know gigabit is obviously faster, but do I really need it?

Agent: (pause) That's a fair question. For most households—even busy ones like yours—500 meg is usually more than sufficient. It's going to handle multiple video calls, streaming, and just everyday usage without any issues. The gigabit plan is really more if you're doing things like large file transfers, gaming competitively online, or if you just want the extra headroom for future expansion.

Customer: Hmm, okay. And there's no installation fee or anything like that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Good news there too. Because you're already an existing customer and you're upgrading, we're waiving the installation fee. We can actually bump you up to the 500 meg plan today, and we'd schedule a technician to come out... (pause) When would work best for you? We have availability this Thursday or Friday, or we could do early next week if that's better.

Customer: This Thursday would be ideal if you can do that.

Agent: Let me check what times we have open. (pause) How does between 1 and 4 PM work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine. My wife might be home, so someone will definitely be there.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to update your account here. Just to recap what we're doing: you're upgrading from the 300 meg plan to our 500 meg fiber plan at $69.99 per month for the first year. The installation fee is waived, and we'll have a technician at your location this Thursday between 1 and 4 PM.

Customer: Sounds good. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Like, do I need to restart my equipment or...?

Agent: The technician will handle all of that when they arrive. They might upgrade your modem or router depending on what you currently have, so your speeds are optimized. Just have someone home to let them in, and they'll take care of the rest. They'll also test everything before they leave to make sure you're getting the speeds you're paying for.

Customer: Alright, that sounds great. When does this go into effect? Like, will I see the change on Thursday or...?

Agent: The pricing change takes effect with your next billing cycle, which looks like it would be... (pause) June 1st for you. So you'll be on the current plan through May, and then starting in June, your bill will reflect the new plan at the promotional rate.

Customer: Got it. And you mentioned the price goes up after the first year?

Agent: Yes, so after your first 12 months, the promotional rate expires and it would go to our regular rate, which is typically around $99.99 for the 500 meg plan. But you know, things change, and you can always give us a call closer to that time. We often have new promotions running, so there might be other options available.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. I think I'm good then. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: I think we've covered everything. Let me just make sure you have the confirmation number for your service call. (typing sounds) Your appointment reference number is 847-FRX-9214. We'll also send that to you via text and email, and the technician will have it on their end too.

Customer: Perfect. And I should expect them between 1 and 4 on Thursday?

Agent: That's right, this Thursday, between 1 and 4 PM. If for any reason you need to reschedule, just give us a call back or you can manage it through your online account.

Customer: Great. Thanks so much, Marcus. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You're going to notice a huge difference with that 500 meg speed. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: Nope, I think that's it. Have a good one.

Agent: You too! Thanks for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day.
