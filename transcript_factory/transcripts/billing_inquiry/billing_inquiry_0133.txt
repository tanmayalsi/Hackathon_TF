Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually I do recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it and nobody told me about it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's, uh... (pause) 555-0847. That's my account number. Wait, no, that's my phone number. Let me find... hold on.

Agent: That's okay, take your time.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Okay, I found the bill. The account number is... 47983-FN.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Let me pull that up here. And what name is the account under?

Customer: Robert Martinez.

Agent: (pause) Great, Robert, I've got your account here. So you mentioned there's a charge you didn't expect. Can you tell me which charge that is and approximately how much it is?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill jumped up. I was paying like $89 a month for the gigabit fiber plan, and this month it says $119. That's a $30 increase out of nowhere. Did you guys just raise the price on everyone or something?

Agent: I understand your frustration, Robert. Let me take a look at your account history here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm seeing that you do have the gigabit fiber plan. Can you tell me... was this a promotional rate that you had originally?

Customer: I mean... I guess? I've been a customer for almost two years now. Nobody said anything about it being promotional. It was just the price.

Agent: Right, okay. (typing sounds) I'm seeing here that you did sign up for a promotional rate back in January of 2022. That was an introductory rate of $89 a month for 24 months. So that promotional period actually ended last month, which is why you're seeing the increase now to our standard rate of $119 a month.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me the company's been charging me a promotional rate this whole time and now it's just going to jump up $30? Nobody ever called me or sent me anything saying this was coming. That's not fair, man.

Agent: I completely understand your perspective, Robert. I can see why that's frustrating. (pause) Let me check what we have on file. It looks like we should have sent you a notification about this rate change... (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing a record of a notification being sent out prior to this, so that's on us, and I apologize for that.

Customer: Yeah, you think? I mean, a heads up would have been nice. What am I supposed to do here?

Agent: Well, let me see what options I have for you. (pause) One moment please... (brief hold music plays) (typing sounds) Okay, Robert, I'm back. So here's what I can do for you. I can't extend the promotional rate indefinitely, but I can offer you an extension on it for another three months at the $89 rate. That would give you a little breathing room and time to decide if you want to keep the service or look at other options.

Customer: Three months? That's it? Then I'm back to $119?

Agent: Well, after those three months, yes, the rate would go back to $119 unless we have any other promotions available at that time. But I want to be upfront with you. I can also show you some of our other plans if you'd like. We have a 500 megabit plan that's $79 a month with no promotional period attached to it—that's a standard rate. It's still excellent speed for most households.

Customer: (pause) ...How much slower is 500 megabits than a gigabit?

Agent: That's a good question. So a gigabit is 1,000 megabits per second, so the 500 megabit plan is half the speed. But honestly, for most people doing typical internet things—streaming, video calls, browsing, even gaming—500 megabits is more than plenty. It's only if you have multiple people in your household doing bandwidth-heavy things simultaneously that you'd really notice a difference.

Customer: Hmm. I live alone, so I guess I don't really need a gig connection. But I don't want to feel like I'm being nickeled and dimed here. I've been a loyal customer for almost two years.

Agent: And I really do appreciate your loyalty, Robert. Tell you what—let me add a loyalty credit to your account. I'm going to go ahead and credit your account $60 for the inconvenience of not being notified about the rate change. That essentially covers two months of your increase right there. And then if you want to switch to the 500 megabit plan at $79, your bill would actually be $10 less than what you were originally paying.

Customer: (pause) Wait, really? So I'd be paying $79?

Agent: Yes, sir. And that's a standard rate with no promotional period, so there won't be any surprises after a certain amount of time. What do you think?

Customer: (pause) ...Yeah, okay. That actually sounds reasonable. Can we do that?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to process that credit now, and I'm also going to downgrade your service to the 500 megabit plan. (typing sounds) (pause) And just to confirm, I'm not seeing any installation fees or anything like that—this is just a plan change, so it should take effect with your next billing cycle. You'll see the credit applied to this month's bill as well.

Customer: Okay, great. So when does this take effect?

Agent: The plan change will be effective starting tomorrow, and you should see the credit reflected on your next bill. You might notice a slight fluctuation in your speeds within the next 24 hours as the system updates, but you should be good to go.

Customer: Alright, that works for me. I appreciate you working with me on this, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Robert. And again, I'm sorry about the lack of notification on the rate change. We should have done a better job communicating that with you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye, Robert!
