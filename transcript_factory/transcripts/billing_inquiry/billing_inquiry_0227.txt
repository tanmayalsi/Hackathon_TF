Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my latest invoice and there's a charge on there that doesn't make sense to me.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my service address on Maple Street.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. That's account ending in 0147... and I'm seeing it's under the name Michael Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And what charge are you seeing that concerns you?

Customer: Well, I got my bill yesterday and my monthly amount went up. Like, significantly. Last month I was paying $89.99 for my internet service, and this month it's showing $119.99. That's like a thirty dollar increase out of nowhere. I haven't added any services or anything. What's going on with that?

Agent: (pause) Let me take a look at what happened here. (typing sounds) I can definitely see that charge difference. Can you tell me... do you know if you were on any kind of promotional rate before?

Customer: Promotional? I don't... I mean, maybe? I've been with Frontier for like three years now. I don't remember signing up for anything special.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. So looking at your account history here, it looks like you were on our introductory rate of $89.99 for the first twelve months. That promotional period ended, and your rate has adjusted to our standard rate for the Fiber 500 plan, which is $119.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. Twelve months? So you're telling me my rate was only that low because of some... some intro deal that I apparently agreed to?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. So when you signed up for your service three years ago, you were enrolled in our new customer promotion. That typically runs for the first year of service. Once that year is complete, the rate adjusts to the regular pricing for that plan tier.

Customer: But nobody told me about this! I mean, I've been paying $89.99 for three years. Why would my promotional period be one year and then I keep paying it for two more years?

Agent: (pause) That's a good question. Let me look into this a bit more. (typing sounds) So I'm seeing... hmm, it looks like there may have been an extension on your promotional pricing that wasn't documented in my notes here. Can you hold for just one moment while I pull up some additional information?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) (30 seconds)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. So I apologize for the confusion here. It looks like you actually had an extended promotional period that went through this month. That's why you were able to hold that rate. However, that extension has now expired as of your current billing cycle. I do apologize that we didn't send you a notification about this rate adjustment before it took effect.

Customer: So basically I'm just out of luck? You're saying there's nothing you can do?

Agent: Well, let me see what options we have available. I can certainly review what promotions we have for existing customers right now. (typing sounds) Are you interested in... would you be open to a longer contract if that meant we could lock in a better rate for you?

Customer: I don't know, maybe? What are we talking about here? Like how much better are we talking?

Agent: So we do have a retention offer that I can apply to your account. If you're willing to commit to a two-year agreement, I can bring your rate down to $99.99 per month. So that would be about twenty dollars more than what you were paying, but still less than the current standard rate of $119.99.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. So instead of thirty dollars more, it would be ten dollars more?

Agent: That's correct.

Customer: And this is locked in for two years?

Agent: Yes, exactly. For the next twenty-four months, your rate would be $99.99 per month, and then after that term expires, your rate would adjust to whatever our standard rates are at that time.

Customer: I mean... that's better than nothing, I guess. But I'm not thrilled about any of this. I feel like I should have been notified about this change.

Agent: I absolutely understand your frustration, and you're right that we should have sent you a courtesy notice. Let me make a note on your account here about that so the team is aware. (typing sounds) And honestly, for the inconvenience of not receiving that notification, let me see if I can do something else for you. What if I added a credit to your account for the overage charges for this month? That would cover the difference between what you were paying and what the standard rate would have been.

Customer: Really? You can do that?

Agent: I can certainly try. Let me apply that now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm applying a one-time account credit of $30 to your account. That should show up on your next billing cycle. So your next bill would be $99.99, and you'd also see that $30 credit applied.

Customer: Okay, well... I appreciate that, actually. That does help.

Agent: Great. I'm glad I could help with that. So just to confirm, you're good to move forward with the two-year agreement at $99.99 per month?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Let's do it.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I'm updating your account now... and there we go. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with your new rate and the terms of your agreement. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Um, I do appreciate you working with me on this, Derek. I just... I wish we could have avoided this whole thing with a notice.

Agent: I completely understand, and again, I apologize for that. We'll definitely make a note so you receive proper notification if there are any changes coming up in the future. Thank you for being a Frontier customer for the past three years, and if you need anything else, don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Take care!
