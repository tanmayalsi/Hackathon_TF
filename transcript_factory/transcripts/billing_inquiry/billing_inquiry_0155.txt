Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I noticed my internet bill went up like thirty dollars a month. I've been a customer for almost five years and nobody told me about this increase.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated with that. I completely understand. Let me pull up your account here and take a look at what's going on. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service address in Scottsdale, Arizona?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. I'm looking at your account now. So I can see that your service has been with us since June 2019. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Agent: Great. And I'm pulling up your billing history here. So what I'm seeing is that your plan was the Fiber 300 internet service at $59.99 a month, and it looks like as of your last billing cycle, it's been adjusted to $89.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yes! Exactly thirty dollars. Why would it jump that much? I mean, I haven't done anything different. I'm not using more internet or anything.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I can definitely see why that would be concerning. Let me check the notes here on your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you were on an introductory promotional rate when you signed up back in 2019. That rate was set to expire after... it looks like 24 months, but it appears there was a service credit that extended it a bit longer.

Customer: So what you're saying is... the promotional price ran out?

Agent: That's exactly what happened. I apologize that this wasn't communicated to you more clearly. Typically, we do send out notices about rate adjustments, usually about 30 days before they take effect. Did you happen to receive any notification in the mail or email?

Customer: (hesitates) I mean... I get a lot of mail. I might have missed something, but still, shouldn't someone have called me or something? Thirty dollars is a big jump. That's like fifty percent more.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I hear you on that. That is a significant increase. Let me see what options I have available for you here. (typing sounds) 

Customer: I mean, I like your service. The internet is fast and reliable. But I can't just accept a fifty percent price hike without at least trying to work something out.

Agent: Understood completely. So I'm looking at our current promotions, and I do have some options that might help. We have a bundle option where we could add our streaming TV service, which would actually lower your overall per-service cost. Or I can offer you a twelve-month rate lock at $69.99 per month, which would get you a twenty dollar reduction from what you're currently being charged.

Customer: Okay, so the $69.99... is that locked in for a year?

Agent: Yes, exactly. For twelve months from this billing cycle, your rate would be $69.99 per month, and then after that, it would be subject to adjustment based on our standard rates at that time.

Customer: (pause) So it's still an increase from what I was paying before, just not as much.

Agent: That's correct. I won't mislead you—it is still higher than your promotional rate, but it's a significant reduction from the $89.99 you're seeing now.

Customer: Hmm. What about that TV bundle thing you mentioned?

Agent: (typing sounds) So with our triple play bundle, we have streaming video service that includes over 200 channels, plus we keep your internet service. The bundle would be $119.99 per month total, which actually breaks down to $54.99 per internet service and $65.00 for the TV. So your internet cost would actually go down compared to the $89.99 you're seeing now.

Customer: But I don't really watch a lot of TV. I mostly use Netflix and stuff. That seems like I'd be paying for something I don't need.

Agent: (pause) That's fair. I mean, if you're not going to use it, there's no sense in adding it. I think the twelve-month rate lock at $69.99 might be your best option then. That gives you a discount and some predictability for the next year.

Customer: Can you do any better than that? I mean, I've been a loyal customer for five years...

Agent: (pause) Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) You know what, because you have been such a loyal customer and you've maintained good account standing, I can actually extend that rate lock to 18 months instead of 12. So $69.99 per month for 18 months. How does that sound?

Customer: Okay, that's... that's better. I appreciate that. So that's locked in for a year and a half?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Eighteen months from this billing cycle. And that way you've got some stability, and you're getting a twenty dollar reduction from the current rate you were charged.

Customer: Alright, I can work with that. But I do want to say, going forward, I think you guys need to do a better job notifying customers before these increases happen.

Agent: You know, that's really fair feedback, and I apologize again that you weren't more clearly informed about this. I'm going to make a note on your account about this concern, and it will be flagged for our customer retention team to review.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: So to confirm, I'm going to go ahead and apply the 18-month rate lock at $69.99 per month, effective immediately. You should see that reflected on your next billing statement. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: My pleasure. Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and again, I apologize for the frustration. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, well thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great day.

Customer: You too. Thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
