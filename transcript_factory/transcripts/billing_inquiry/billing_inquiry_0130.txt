Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like thirty dollars since last month. I'm pretty upset about it.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'm sorry you're experiencing that. Let me pull up your account so we can take a look together. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this for an account under the name... let me see here... Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. I'm looking at your account now. I can see your most recent bill here. You're right—it does look like there's been an increase. Can you tell me which specific charge you're concerned about, or is it the overall increase you want to discuss?

Customer: Well, both actually. The overall bill jumped from like $89 to $119, which is crazy. But there's also a line item that says "Equipment Rental Fee - $14.99" and I've never seen that before. I don't think I should be paying for equipment rental.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so we're looking at two things here. Let me address the equipment fee first. According to your account, you have one of our Frontier-provided routers. Do you remember receiving a router from us, or... did that come with your service?

Customer: I mean... yes, I have the router you guys provided when I set up the service two years ago. But I wasn't charged for it back then. Why am I being charged now?

Agent: That's a fair question. So what likely happened here is... (pause) ...our billing system recently updated, and we now charge a separate equipment rental fee for customers who are using our provided equipment rather than their own router. It should have been disclosed when we made that change, and I apologize if you didn't receive that notification.

Customer: That's ridiculous. You didn't contact me about that. I would've bought my own router to avoid this fee.

Agent: I hear you, and I sincerely apologize for that. That fee typically runs about $14.99 a month. But let me look into the other part of your increase. (typing sounds) I'm seeing here that you were moved from our standard fiber plan at $89.99 to our enhanced plan at $119.99. Do you remember requesting a speed upgrade?

Customer: No! I definitely did not request that. I was happy with my speeds. Why would I be upgraded without asking?

Agent: (pause) Hmm, that's... that shouldn't have happened without your authorization. Let me look at the notes here. (typing sounds) It looks like this change went into effect about six weeks ago. Did you happen to notice anything different with your service around that time?

Customer: I mean... maybe my speeds did improve? But I didn't ask for that! Who authorized that change?

Agent: That's what I'm trying to figure out. Looking at the notes, it just says "Customer request via chat" but there's no detail. Do you remember having a chat conversation with one of our representatives?

Customer: Not that I can remember. Could someone have accessed my account or... I don't know, is this a scam?

Agent: No, no, I don't think that's the case. Your account appears secure, and this change was processed through our legitimate system. But I completely understand your concern. What I'd like to do is help make this right for you. First, let me remove that equipment rental fee from your current bill. That shouldn't have been applied without proper notice, and we can work out alternative arrangements if you'd like to use your own router.

Customer: Okay, well... I mean, that's good, I guess. But what about the plan upgrade?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Let me see what options we have. So typically, if a customer is upgraded without authorization, we can downgrade them back to their original plan. That would bring your bill back down to $89.99 per month, which is what you were paying before. However, if you've been enjoying the faster speeds, we could also consider keeping the upgrade but applying a courtesy credit to offset some of the difference.

Customer: How much of a credit are we talking about?

Agent: Well, the difference is $30 a month. What I can do is apply a three-month credit of $30 to your account. So your next three bills would be reduced by $30 each. After that, you'd be on the new plan at full price. Would that be acceptable, or would you prefer me to downgrade you back to your original speeds and plan?

Customer: (pause) ...So if I take the credit, I'd be paying like $89.99 again for the next three months because of the credit?

Agent: Exactly right. You'd see the $119.99 charge, but then the $30 credit would bring your out-of-pocket cost to $89.99. And after the three months, it would be the full $119.99 unless you decide to downgrade.

Customer: (pause) I mean... I guess I could give the faster speeds a try for three months. But I want to make sure there are no more surprise charges, alright?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to make a note on your account right now that you received proactive notification of this change, and I'm also going to flag it so you won't be charged that equipment rental fee going forward. If you do want to bring your own router at any point, we can remove that charge permanently.

Customer: Okay. And you're removing the $14.99?

Agent: Yes, I'm removing the equipment rental fee from your current bill right now. (typing sounds) And I'm applying the three-month $30 courtesy credit as well. You should see both of those adjustments reflected on your next bill.

Customer: Alright. Well, I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. I'm sorry again for the confusion with the upgrade. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
