Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. It's... it's pretty significant, and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my landline.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. One moment please... Alright, I have your account here. Your name is Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize. Can you tell me what amount we're talking about, or do you see it on your current bill?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. My bill is usually around $89 a month for the fiber internet, right? But this month it jumped to $127. That's almost forty dollars more than what I normally pay. I haven't made any changes to my service, so I have no idea why it went up like that.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at what changed on your account. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that... ah, yes. I see what happened. It looks like your promotional rate expired.

Customer: Wait, what? A promotional rate? I've had this service for... I don't know, three or four years now. Nobody told me anything about a promotional rate expiring.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the confusion. It looks like when you initially signed up, you were on a promotional pricing of $79.99 per month for the first twelve months. That promotion ended, and your rate adjusted to our standard pricing, which is $119.99 a month for our Fiber 300 plan.

Customer: So what you're telling me is that I was getting a discount, and now that's gone? Why wasn't I notified about this? Shouldn't you guys send out a notice or something?

Agent: That's a fair question, and I apologize. We should have sent you a notification before the rate changed. Let me see what I can do here for you. (typing sounds) So it looks like the rate change was processed on your last billing cycle. I can definitely see if we have any options to help you here.

Customer: Look, I appreciate that. I mean, I like your service—the speed is great—but I can't just absorb a forty-dollar increase without any explanation. That's almost fifty percent more than what I was paying.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I hear you. Let me check what promotions or loyalty discounts we might have available for you. (pause) Okay, so I do have a couple of options. I can offer you a rate reduction for twelve months. We could bring you down to $99.99 per month, which would give you some relief while you consider your options. Or, I could look into our Fiber 200 plan, which is a tier down in speed, and that runs at $89.99 a month—so you'd stay right around where you were.

Customer: Hmm. I mean, the Fiber 300 speed is really good though. I work from home, and I do a lot of video conferencing and uploads. I don't really want to downgrade.

Agent: I totally understand. The Fiber 300 is definitely a solid plan, especially if you're doing bandwidth-intensive work. So let me put you on the promotional rate I mentioned—$99.99 for twelve months. That's a thirty-dollar difference from before, but it's still a twenty-dollar savings compared to the standard rate.

Customer: Thirty dollars a month more than what I was paying before though. That's still a chunk of change.

Agent: It is, and I understand your point. Unfortunately, I don't have the ability to extend the original promotional rate beyond the twelve months it was already set for. However, I'll make a note on your account here... (typing sounds) ...that you've been a loyal customer, and that we should reach out proactively ninety days before the current promotion expires so we can discuss options before any further increases happen. That way you won't be caught off guard again.

Customer: I guess that's better than nothing. So you're saying I can do $99.99 for the next year, and then we'll talk about it again before something else changes?

Agent: That's exactly right. And honestly, at that point we might have other promotions available, or I can escalate it to our retention team to see what other options might be on the table for you. Does that sound workable?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Yeah, that works. Can you apply that to my account now?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me process that for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm updating your rate to $99.99 a month, effective immediately. Your new bill should reflect that on your next billing cycle. You should receive an updated bill summary within the next few days in your account portal and via email.

Customer: Alright. Thank you. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course. I really do apologize again that we didn't communicate that change better upfront. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, Robert. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
