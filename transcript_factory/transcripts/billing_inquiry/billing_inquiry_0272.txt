Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged way more than I should have been, and I'm pretty frustrated about it.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you're experiencing that. I'd be happy to help you look into this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up real quick... Got it. Your name is Michael Thornton, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned a charge that seems higher than expected. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're seeing?

Customer: Well, I've been a customer for, I dunno, three years now? And my bill has always been around $89.99 for the gigabit fiber package. But this month I opened my bill and it's $129.99. That's like a forty dollar increase out of nowhere. And I didn't authorize any changes or anything.

Agent: Oh wow, yeah, I can see why that would be frustrating. (pause) Let me take a look at your account history here... Okay, so I'm looking at your billing. You're right—your previous charges have been consistently at $89.99. And yes, this month it is showing as $129.99. 

Customer: Right, so what happened? Did you guys just decide to raise rates on me without telling me?

Agent: That's a great question, and I want to get to the bottom of this for you. Let me check a few things. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that your promotional rate expired. It looks like you signed up for a two-year promotional pricing when you first became a customer, and that expired as of this billing cycle.

Customer: A promotional rate? I wasn't told about any expiration date. Nobody called me or sent me anything saying it was going to go up.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Michael. Let me check your account notes... (pause) Okay, so I see that we did send out notification letters about thirty days before the promotional period ended. That would have been around early last month. Did you possibly receive something in the mail that might have mentioned this?

Customer: I get so much mail, I don't know. Maybe? But honestly, that seems like a pretty important thing to make sure a customer actually understands is happening. I mean, if someone told me about it, I don't remember it.

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate your patience with me. So the rate you're seeing now, $129.99, is our standard gigabit fiber pricing without the promotional discount. However, I don't want to leave you in a position where you feel like you got hit with a surprise increase.

Customer: So what are my options here? Can you put me back on the promotional rate or something?

Agent: That's exactly what I want to explore with you. (typing sounds) Let me see what promotions I have available right now... Okay, so I can't extend the original promotion since that was a limited-time new customer offer, but I do have the ability to offer you a loyalty discount. I can get you back to $94.99 per month for the next twelve months. That's a fifteen dollar savings compared to where you are now, and it's still a solid value for our gigabit service.

Customer: Okay, so that's only like a five dollar increase from what I was paying before. That's... that's better, I guess. But I'm still not thrilled about it going up at all.

Agent: I completely understand. And I appreciate you giving me a chance to make this right. The reality is that our pricing does have to adjust over time, but I want to make sure we're taking good care of long-term customers like yourself. The twelve-month loyalty rate is definitely the best option I can offer you.

Customer: (pause) Alright, fine. Let's go with that. But I want to make sure I don't get surprised again in twelve months.

Agent: Absolutely. So what I'm going to do is I'm putting a note on your account right now that you are on a promotional rate that expires in twelve months. And we will make sure to reach out to you at least sixty days before that expires so you know exactly what's coming. I can also flag your account for a courtesy call instead of just a letter. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yeah, actually, that would be really helpful. Thank you.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I've added that note. So to recap—I'm adjusting your rate to $94.99 per month effective with your next billing cycle. You'll see that reflected on your next bill. And we'll reach out to you proactively before your promotional period ends in twelve months. Does that all sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that's good. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course. And again, I'm sorry about the confusion with the initial increase. We appreciate your business, Michael, and we want to keep you as a valued customer. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... that's all I needed. Thanks for fixing it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and we hope you continue to enjoy your service. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
