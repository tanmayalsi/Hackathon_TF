Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I just got charged way more than usual this month and I don't understand why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. And my number is 555-0147... wait, I mean the account number is 555-0147 and my phone number is 555-2849.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm pulling up your account here... Okay, I see an account for Sarah Chen at 1247 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you're saying your bill this month is higher than usual. Can you tell me what you're normally paying and what the charge was this month?

Customer: Well, normally it's like $79.99 a month for my internet plan, right? But this month the bill came through at $99.99. That's a twenty dollar difference! I don't know what happened, and nobody told me there was going to be a price increase.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me look into this for you. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account history here. I do see that your promotional rate expired. You were on a promotional price of $79.99 for twelve months, and that ended on March 15th of this year.

Customer: Wait, nobody told me about that. When was I supposed to find out? I got no notification, no email, nothing.

Agent: I apologize for that. Let me check... (typing sounds) I'm seeing that we did send a notification letter to your address on file about 45 days prior to the rate change, which would have been around early February. Did you possibly not receive that, or...?

Customer: I mean... I don't know. Maybe it got lost or something. But the thing is, I've been a customer for what, five or six years? And I never had any issues. This just seems unfair that you'd just bump me up like that without at least calling me or sending an email.

Agent: I hear you, and I really do apologize. You're right that we should have done more to make sure you were aware. That's a fair point. So the $99.99 rate—that's our standard rate for your plan now. But let me see what options we might have available for you.

Customer: Okay, well... what kind of options? Can you get me back down to the $79.99?

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) So that promotional rate isn't active anymore, but let me look at what we might be able to offer. Do you have any interest in maybe upgrading to our Gig-speed fiber plan? We have a promotion running right now where...

Customer: No, no, I don't need faster internet. I just want to keep paying what I was paying before. I'm not trying to get extra stuff—I just want the same service at the same price.

Agent: I understand completely. Let me... (pause) Let me check with my supervisor on this one. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure. How long do you think?

Agent: Should be just a couple minutes. Thank you for your patience.

Customer: Okay.

(hold music plays for approximately 90 seconds)

Agent: Thank you for holding. I spoke with my supervisor, and what we can do is offer you a courtesy credit for the difference on this month's bill, so that would be $20 off this month. And then going forward, I can get you enrolled in a new promotional rate. We have a six-month promotional rate at $84.99 per month, which is lower than the standard rate.

Customer: Hmm. So $84.99? That's still more than I was paying before.

Agent: I know, and I apologize for that. Unfortunately, our promotional rates do vary, and the twelve-month promotional rate you had is no longer available for existing customers. But the six-month rate at $84.99 is the best I can do for you at this time. After those six months, it would go back to $99.99 unless we have other promotions available.

Customer: (sighs) This is frustrating, but... I mean, at least it's better than paying a hundred bucks a month. Can you do anything else though? Like, I don't know, extend the promotional period or anything?

Agent: Let me see... (typing sounds) Unfortunately, I don't have the ability to extend beyond the six months on that rate. But what I can do is add a courtesy credit of $20 to your account today, and I'll go ahead and apply the $84.99 promotional rate for the next six billing cycles. And then as we get closer to the end of that, I can definitely give you a call to see what options might be available at that time.

Customer: Okay... I guess that works. So I'll see the $20 credit on my next bill?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. It should show up on your next bill, which would be... let me see... looks like that'll be on April 12th. And then your promotional rate will start on your next billing cycle as well.

Customer: Alright. And just so I'm clear—after six months, if I don't call or if we don't talk about this again, it's just going back to $99.99?

Agent: That's correct, yes. It will revert to the standard rate of $99.99 unless we set up another promotion or you reach out to us. But honestly, I'd recommend giving us a call a week or so before that six months ends, and we can review what options are available to you then.

Customer: Okay, I'll make a note of that. Um, is there anything I can do to avoid this kind of thing happening again? Like... getting notifications or something?

Agent: That's a great question. You can definitely log into your Frontier account online and update your contact preferences to make sure you're receiving email notifications about things like rate changes and important account information. Would you like me to send you a link to that portal?

Customer: Sure, yeah, send it to the email on file. That would be helpful.

Agent: Perfect. I'll send that out right away. (typing sounds) Okay, all set. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for working with me on this, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. I really do appreciate your loyalty as a Frontier customer, and again, I apologize for the confusion around the rate change. If you need anything else in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: I will. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Thank you for calling Frontier!
