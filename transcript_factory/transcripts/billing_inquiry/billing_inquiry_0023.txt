Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm pretty upset about it. My internet bill just jumped up like thirty dollars. I wasn't expecting that at all.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here. One moment please.

Customer: (background noise - TV in distance) Sure, take your time.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I've got your account here. Your name is Robert Chen, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So I'm seeing that your billing cycle ended on the 15th. Your previous bill was $69.99, and your current bill is $99.99. Is that the increase you're referring to?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. Thirty bucks more. I've been with you guys for like... what, three years now? My rate was locked in or something. I don't remember getting any notification about this.

Agent: I understand your concern. Let me check your account details here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your service history. You were on a promotional rate for 24 months that expired on... March 15th of this year. That was about three months ago.

Customer: Wait, three months ago? So this should've happened three months ago, not now.

Agent: That's a good question. Let me look into this. (pause) I'm seeing here that there was actually a courtesy extension applied to your account after the promotion ended. That's why you didn't see the increase right away. But it looks like that extension expired at the end of your last billing cycle.

Customer: Okay, but... I mean, did I get a letter about this? Because I don't remember getting anything in the mail or an email or... I don't know.

Agent: That's definitely something we should have communicated better. Let me check your contact preferences. (typing sounds) So I do see that we sent out a notification about thirty days before the extension expired. But I completely understand if you didn't receive it or if it got lost. We should have been clearer about that.

Customer: I don't think I got anything, honestly. And even if I did, it would've been nice to know what my options were. Like, can't you guys lock in a new rate or something? This is a pretty big jump for me.

Agent: Absolutely, I hear you. Let me see what promotions I have available for you right now. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so because you're a loyal customer and you've been with us for three years, I can offer you a new promotional rate. I can get you locked in at $79.99 for the next 12 months for your Gig-speed fiber service.

Customer: So that's... still like ten dollars more than what I was paying before.

Agent: I understand it's still an increase, but the good news is that locks you in for a full year and protects you from any further rate changes during that time. After the 12 months, we can work with you again on renewal rates.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. What about if I... do you have any other plans? Like, could I downgrade or something?

Agent: That's definitely an option. We have our standard fiber service at 500 Mbps for $59.99 per month. And we also have our basic plan at 100 Mbps for $49.99. What speeds are you currently using?

Customer: I'm doing the gigabit one, the Gig plan. I guess I use it for work sometimes, streaming, stuff like that. I don't know if I really need it though.

Agent: The gigabit plan is definitely overkill for most households, to be honest. The 500 Mbps plan would still be really fast and handle all of those activities without any problem. That would bring your bill down to $59.99.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so if I downgrade, I save ten bucks from my original bill. But then I'm paying almost the same as the new price you just offered me.

Agent: Right, so the difference is that the 12-month promotion locks you into that $79.99 rate with the gigabit speeds you already have. With the downgrade, you'd be at $59.99 but with slower speeds. So it really depends on whether you need those faster speeds or not.

Customer: Can I think about this? I mean, I just want to make sure I'm making the right decision here.

Agent: Of course, you can absolutely take some time to think about it. But I do want to mention that this promotional rate is something I can apply right now, and I'd recommend taking advantage of it since the standard rate is already $99.99. Once you hang up, if you call back, you might not get the same offer.

Customer: Really? So I have to decide right now?

Agent: I appreciate you wanting to take time, and I definitely understand that. What I can do is apply this $79.99 rate for you right now, and it will take effect on your next billing cycle. If you decide in the next few days that you want to downgrade or make any other changes, you can absolutely call back and we can adjust it. Does that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah... yeah, I guess that makes sense. Okay, let's do the $79.99 for the year.

Agent: Excellent. I'm going to apply that promotion to your account right now. (typing sounds) Alright, so your new rate of $79.99 per month is locked in for the next 12 months. That will show up on your next billing cycle which starts on... April 15th. Your current bill at the higher rate of $99.99 will be the final bill at that price.

Customer: Okay, good. And you said I could call back if I change my mind?

Agent: Absolutely. You have up until your next billing cycle starts to make any changes if you want to. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Robert?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Oh, except... can you send me some kind of confirmation? Like, in writing, about this promotion?

Agent: Definitely. I'm sending that confirmation to the email address we have on file right now. You should receive it within the next couple of minutes. If you don't see it, check your spam folder just in case.

Customer: Okay, thanks for that.

Agent: You're welcome. I also want to apologize again for not being clearer about the rate expiration. We should have done a better job communicating that to you.

Customer: Yeah, I appreciate that. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: Of course. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your loyalty. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Robert. Have a great day, and thank you for calling Frontier.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
