Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize. Plus, my internet bill went up like thirty bucks a month and nobody told me about it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under Sarah Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. I've got your account here. I can see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. Let me take a look at your recent charges. (pause) So I'm seeing your bill from last month was $89.99, and this month it's showing $119.99. Is that the increase you're referring to?

Customer: Yeah, that's it. That's almost a thirty dollar jump. I haven't changed anything. Why would my bill go up that much?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me look into what happened here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you were on a promotional rate that expired. You had a twelve-month promotional pricing for $89.99, and that promotion ended on your last billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, what? I never agreed to a promotional rate. I've been paying that same price since I signed up almost two years ago.

Agent: Let me check the details on when your account was created... (pause) Okay, so according to our system, your account was set up on March 15th, 2022, and you were enrolled in our twelve-month new customer promotion at that time. That would have ended in March of this year.

Customer: But I'm still paying it now in... it's December. Why am I just now getting hit with this?

Agent: That's a great question. (pause) It looks like there may have been a system error on our end. Your promotion should have expired in March, but it appears it continued through September. The charge on your current bill is reflecting the adjustment back to our standard pricing for that service tier.

Customer: So you're saying you messed up and now I have to pay for it? That doesn't seem right.

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from. This definitely should have been communicated to you back in March when the promotion was set to expire. We typically send out notices, but it looks like that didn't happen in your case. Let me see what options I have here... (typing sounds) What I can do is apply a courtesy credit for the difference between the promotional rate and the standard rate for the months from March through September. That would bring your balance down significantly.

Customer: How much are we talking about?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) So that would be six months at the difference of approximately thirty dollars per month. That would be a credit of about... $180 to your account.

Customer: Oh. Well, okay, that's... that's better than nothing, I guess. But what about going forward? Am I stuck at this new price?

Agent: Well, the standard rate for the Fiber 500 plan is $119.99 per month going forward. However, I'd like to see if we have any current promotions I can apply to your account. (typing sounds) Let me check... Okay, so we do have a promotion available where I could reduce your rate to $99.99 per month for the next twelve months. Would that interest you?

Customer: So I'd still be paying ten dollars more than what I was paying before?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. The promotional pricing I can offer is $99.99, which is $10 more than your original promotional rate. But it would lock you in at that price for another full year.

Customer: (pause) I mean, I guess that's better than $119.99. But I'm not happy about any of this. You guys should've let me know months ago.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that oversight. The lack of communication from us was definitely not okay. So let me confirm what I'm doing here: I'm going to apply the $180 courtesy credit for the past six months, and I'm going to enroll you in the promotional rate of $99.99 for the next twelve months. Does that sound good?

Customer: Yeah, okay. And what about that other charge I mentioned? There's something on my bill for... (pause, sound of rustling papers) ...it says "Professional Installation - Modem Upgrade." I don't remember scheduling an installation or getting a new modem.

Agent: Hmm, let me look at that. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing a charge for $49.99 for professional installation. Do you remember receiving a new modem?

Customer: I mean, I got something in the mail a few weeks ago that I assumed was just marketing stuff. I never opened it. I didn't ask for a new modem.

Agent: (pause) I apologize. It looks like this was part of a proactive modem upgrade program we rolled out, but this should have been opt-in, not automatic. You should not have been charged for this if you didn't request the service. Let me reverse this charge for you right now.

Customer: Thank you. So let me make sure I have all this straight. You're crediting me $180 for the billing issue, reversing the $49.99 installation charge, and lowering my monthly rate to $99.99 for the next year?

Agent: That's exactly right. So your new balance after the $180 credit and the $49.99 reversal will be significantly lower, and your going rate will be $99.99 per month starting next month.

Customer: Okay. I appreciate that. I still think you guys should have communicated better, but I'm satisfied with this.

Agent: I really do apologize for the frustration this has caused. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. You should see those credits reflected on your account within 24 hours. You'll receive a confirmation email as well. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, Sarah, and thank you for calling in.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day. Goodbye.
