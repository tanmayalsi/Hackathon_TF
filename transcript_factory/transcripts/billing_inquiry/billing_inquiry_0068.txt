Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I just got my statement for this month and there's a charge on here that shouldn't be there.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. I'm seeing the account for... is this Sarah Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned there's a charge you're disputing. Can you tell me which charge you're referring to?

Customer: Well, actually, I'm seeing two things. First, there's a "Service Plan Adjustment" for like forty-five dollars, and then my internet bill itself went up. I was paying 79.99 a month, and now it's showing 94.99. That's a fifteen-dollar increase and nobody told me about it.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I understand your frustration. Let me look into both of those for you. (typing sounds) So looking at your account here, I can see that your promotional pricing ended this month. You've been on our promotional rate for... let me see here... twelve months. So that's actually expiring right now, which is why you're seeing that increase to the standard rate.

Customer: Wait, what? I never agreed to a promotional rate. I just signed up for internet service. Why wasn't I told about this?

Agent: I completely understand. So typically when customers sign up, we do offer introductory pricing for the first year. It looks like you were on our Fiber 200 plan at the promotional price. That rate was good for twelve months, and now you're transitioning to our standard pricing for that same service level.

Customer: That's ridiculous. So you're just... what, you just raise everyone's bill after a year? That's not fair. I should have been notified about this.

Agent: You know, that's fair feedback. We do send out notifications, but I know sometimes they can get lost or missed. I apologize for that. Um... (pause) let me see what I can do here for you. Do you have a moment to go over some options?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I don't really have a choice, do I?

Agent: Well, actually, you do have a few options. First, I want to address that forty-five-dollar charge. That was a service plan adjustment fee that shouldn't have been applied. Let me go ahead and credit that to your account right now.

Customer: Really? Okay, well that's something at least.

Agent: (typing sounds) Done. You should see that credit reflected on your next bill. Now, regarding the rate increase... I can't bring you back to the promotional pricing, unfortunately. But what I can do is apply a loyalty discount to your account. That would bring your rate down to... let me see... $84.99 per month for the next twelve months. That way you're only seeing about a five-dollar increase instead of fifteen.

Customer: So I still have to pay more than what I'm paying now?

Agent: I understand it's still an increase, and I apologize for that. The thing is, the promotional rate was really a special introductory offer, so the increase to standard pricing is... it's pretty common in the industry. But this loyalty discount does help offset some of that. And after the twelve months, we could look at other options at that time.

Customer: (sighs) I mean, I guess that's better than fifteen dollars. But this really feels like a bait and switch. If I'd known my bill was going to jump this much, I might not have signed up.

Agent: I hear you. And I'm really sorry you feel that way. The promotional offer is definitely something we lead with because it is a great value, and I wish the transition had been communicated to you more clearly. But I do want you to know that we value your business, which is why I'm able to offer you this loyalty discount.

Customer: Okay, so how long is that good for?

Agent: The loyalty discount will be applied for twelve months from now. So you'll have the $84.99 rate through... (typing sounds) ...through December 2025. After that, we'd want to work with you on whatever options are available at that time.

Customer: And what about the service? Like, am I getting the same internet speed, or am I paying more for the same thing?

Agent: You're getting the exact same service. You're still on our Fiber 200 plan, so you're getting 200 megabits per second download speeds, fiber-optic quality. Nothing changes with the service itself. It's just the pricing structure is different once that promotional period ends.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I guess that's fine. But I want to make sure I get something in writing about this loyalty discount so I don't get hit with another surprise next year.

Agent: Absolutely, that's a great idea. I'm going to send you an email confirmation with all the details of the loyalty discount, including the rate, the effective date, and the expiration date. You should receive that within the next couple hours. And I also want to make sure you have my direct reference number in case you need to follow up on anything. Can I get an email address for you?

Customer: Yeah, it's S-C-H-E-N... no wait, it's sarah.chen.1987@emailservice.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I've got that down. And I'm also adding a note to your account about this conversation, so if you do call back, any of our agents will be able to see exactly what was discussed and agreed upon.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I appreciate you at least trying to help with this.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... maybe your company could work on communicating better about these things. It would go a long way.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I appreciate that feedback. I'm going to make sure that gets passed along to our management team. And Sarah, thank you for being a Frontier customer. We really do appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks. Okay, bye.

Agent: You take care now. Have a great day.
