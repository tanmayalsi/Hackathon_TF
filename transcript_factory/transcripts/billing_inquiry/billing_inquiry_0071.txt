Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I just got my statement for this month and there's a charge on here that shouldn't be there.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... All right, I've got your account. The name on the account is Michael Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. And what charge are you seeing that concerns you?

Customer: Well, I'm looking at my bill here, and last month I was paying $89.99 a month for my internet plan. But this month it says $119.99. That's a thirty dollar increase! Nobody told me my rate was going to go up that much. What's going on?

Agent: I understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. Let me look into that for you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing here that you were on our Fiber 300 plan at $89.99 per month. That promotional rate... looks like it expired at the end of last month. Your account has now moved to our standard rate for that plan, which is $119.99.

Customer: A promotional rate? I've been a customer for like... three years now. This doesn't feel promotional to me. Why wasn't I notified about this?

Agent: That's a fair question. Typically, customers do receive a notice around 30 days before a promotional rate expires. Let me check your account here to see... (typing sounds) I'm not seeing a notation that a courtesy notice was sent out. I sincerely apologize for that. That should have happened.

Customer: Yeah, well it didn't happen. So what am I supposed to do? I can't just absorb a thirty dollar a month increase. That's almost four hundred dollars a year!

Agent: I completely understand, and I appreciate your loyalty as a three-year customer. Let me see what options I have available for you. (pause, typing sounds) One moment, please...

Customer: (background noise) Yeah, okay.

Agent: All right, Mr. Chen, I've got a couple of options we can explore here. First, I can apply a one-time account credit of $30 to cover the difference this month. But for going forward, let me check what promotional offers we currently have available for existing customers... (typing sounds) Okay, so I can move you to our Fiber 500 plan at $99.99 a month for the next 12 months. That would actually be a better value for you—you'd get faster speeds and it's only $10 more than what you were paying before.

Customer: Wait, so I'd get faster internet too?

Agent: Yes, sir. You'd be upgrading from 300 megabits per second to 500 megabits per second, all for $99.99 a month for the next year. After that year, the rate would adjust to the standard rate, which for that plan is $129.99, but we can address that when we get there.

Customer: (pause) So you're saying if I agree to this, I'm only paying ten dollars more than I was before, but I'm getting a faster internet speed?

Agent: That's correct. And I would also apply that $30 credit to your current bill to offset this month's increase entirely. So your next bill would reflect the promotional price, and you'd see the credit applied.

Customer: Hmm... that's actually not terrible. But I want to make sure—this is locked in for 12 months, right? I don't want to be surprised again.

Agent: Yes, this promotion is locked in for 12 months from today. You won't see any changes until that 12-month period is up, and we would definitely make sure you receive advance notice before any rate changes after that. I can add a note to your account as well requesting that we send you a courtesy notice at the 30-day mark before your next promotional period ends.

Customer: Okay, yeah, add that note. And just to clarify—I'm not signing up for some long-term contract or anything, right? I can cancel anytime?

Agent: (typing sounds) No, sir. This is month-to-month service. The promotion is for 12 months, but you retain the flexibility to cancel anytime without penalty. That's one of the benefits of being a Frontier customer.

Customer: All right. Yeah, I think I can live with that. Go ahead and make those changes.

Agent: Perfect. Let me process this for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm applying the promotional rate change to the Fiber 500 plan at $99.99 per month, effective immediately. I'm also applying the $30 one-time credit to your account, which will show up on your next bill. And I've added the account note requesting advance notice 30 days before your next promotional rate expires. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks for working with me on this, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome, Mr. Chen. I really do apologize again for the lack of notice on the rate change. We value your business, and I'm glad we could get this sorted out for you. You should see your service upgraded by tomorrow morning. If you don't, just give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks. You too.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Goodbye!

Customer: Bye.
