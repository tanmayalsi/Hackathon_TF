Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my internet price went up like thirty bucks. I've been a customer for, I don't know, five years now, and this is ridiculous.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'm sorry you're experiencing that. Let me pull up your account real quick so I can take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the address on file at 2847 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. Give me just one second here... (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. So I can see your most recent bill from September. Can you tell me which charge you don't recognize?

Customer: Okay, so like, my normal bill is usually around $89, right? But this month it's $119. That's almost a thirty dollar jump. And then there's a separate line item that says "Equipment Upgrade Fee" for $19.95 that I definitely didn't authorize.

Agent: Okay, so we've got two things to address here. First, the equipment upgrade fee. Do you remember receiving any notification about upgrading your equipment or modem?

Customer: No, nothing. I mean, I got some emails but I don't read all of them. But I didn't ask for anything to be upgraded. My internet's been working fine.

Agent: (typing sounds) That's really helpful context. And the modem you have now—do you know approximately how old it is?

Customer: Um, honestly, I'm not sure. Several years probably? Like three or four years old maybe?

Agent: Okay. So what may have happened here is we sent you a notification about a modem replacement program. Our older models can actually slow down over time, and we proactively upgrade customers' equipment at no charge, but there is a one-time installation and processing fee. That's what that $19.95 charge would be for. It should have been included in the communications we sent out.

Customer: Well I don't remember getting anything clear about being charged for it. Can you remove that fee?

Agent: (pause) I understand. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) Okay, so the fee is technically associated with the equipment replacement service, which did occur last month according to your records. However, given that you didn't authorize it explicitly, I'm going to go ahead and credit that $19.95 back to your account as a courtesy. You'll see that on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, well that's something at least. But what about the thirty dollar price increase? That's the bigger issue.

Agent: Right, absolutely. So, let me explain that. Your account shows that your promotional rate expired at the end of August. You were enrolled in our promotional pricing for 24 months at $89.99 a month for our 200 Mbps fiber internet service. That promotional period has ended, so your rate adjusted to our standard pricing, which is $119.99 for the same service.

Customer: So you're just, what, making me pay more now because I've been a loyal customer? That doesn't make any sense.

Agent: I hear you, and I know that's frustrating. What I can do is look at what promotions we have available for you right now. (typing sounds) Since you've been with us for five years, you definitely have loyalty value to us. Let me check our current offers... (pause) Okay, so I can offer you a special rate of $99.99 a month for the first three months as a loyalty offer, and then it would go to $109.99 after that. So you'd still see a bump, but it would be less than the full standard rate.

Customer: So you can offer me $109.99 but not keep me at $89.99?

Agent: I wish I could, really. The promotional pricing is typically only available for new customers or for customers who haven't had a promotion in a certain amount of time. Since your last promotion just ended, it wouldn't normally qualify you for another full-term promotional rate. But this loyalty offer I'm putting together is a bit of a middle ground. That would save you about ten dollars a month compared to our standard rate.

Customer: (sighs) That's still more than I'm paying now.

Agent: I understand. If you'd like, I could also go through some of our other service tiers. We do have a lower-speed option at 100 Mbps that would be $79.99 a month. Would that work for your household?

Customer: How much slower is that really going to be? I work from home doing Zoom calls.

Agent: That's a good question. The 100 Mbps tier is still more than adequate for video conferencing. You'd be able to run multiple Zoom calls simultaneously without any issues. The 200 Mbps would give you more headroom if you have other devices using bandwidth at the same time, but if it's just your work from home usage, the 100 Mbps is typically sufficient.

Customer: Hmm. I mean, I guess I could look into it. But I'm not thrilled about this. I've never had to worry about my bill before.

Agent: I absolutely understand. Tell you what—let me go ahead and apply that loyalty promotion we discussed: $99.99 for three months and then $109.99 after that. I'm also adding that $19.95 credit. And here's what I'll do—if after a couple months you want to explore the lower tier, you can just give us a call back and we can make that adjustment.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I guess that's better than nothing.

Agent: I really appreciate your patience, and I'm sorry for the surprise with the bill. I've got all of those adjustments queued up on your account right now. You should see the credit on your next bill, and the new promotional rate will start on your October billing cycle.

Customer: Okay. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for being a valued Frontier customer for the past five years. We really do appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
