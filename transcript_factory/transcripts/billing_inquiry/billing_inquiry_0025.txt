Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that wasn't there last month. My internet bill just went up like twenty bucks, and I don't know why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your bill. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up. One moment please.

(pause)

Agent: Okay, I've got your account here. I'm looking at your current plan and... yes, I can see what's going on. It looks like you were on a promotional rate that expired at the end of last month.

Customer: What? I didn't... nobody told me about that. I've had this service for like three years now. You guys can't just raise my bill without telling me.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me explain what happened. You signed up for a 12-month promotional rate of $59.99 per month, and that promotion ended on October 31st. Your bill has now adjusted to our standard rate of $79.99 for the Gig Fiber plan.

Customer: Okay, but... I mean, did you guys send me anything about this? Because I don't remember getting a notification.

Agent: (pause) That's a great question. According to our records, we should have sent you a notice about 30 days before the promotion ended. Let me check if there's a note here about... (typing sounds) ...it looks like it was sent via email to the address we have on file. Did you receive anything from us in late September or early October?

Customer: I... honestly, I get so much email. I mean, maybe? But like, wouldn't a phone call or something be better? I've been a loyal customer for three years.

Agent: You make a fair point, and I appreciate your loyalty. I'm going to be honest with you—the email notification is our standard practice, but I understand that things get missed. Let me see what I can do here to help you out.

(typing sounds)

Agent: Okay, so here's what I can offer. I can apply a one-time credit of $20 to your account for this month to offset the increase. That would bring your bill back down to $59.99 for October's billing cycle. However, going forward, your standard rate would be $79.99 unless you'd like to look at other options.

Customer: So, like... what other options? Can I go back to the promotional rate? Or is there something else?

Agent: Great question. We actually have a couple of things we could explore. One option is we have a loyalty promotion I could apply—it's a six-month rate hold at $69.99 per month. It's not quite the promotional rate you had, but it's lower than the standard rate. Or, if you're interested, we could look at our more basic fiber plan, which is 300 Mbps instead of the Gig speed, and that would be $49.99 per month.

Customer: Hmm. So the loyalty thing is $69.99 for six months?

Agent: Yes, exactly. That's $69.99 per month for six months. After that, it would go back to the standard rate of $79.99, but you'd get another notice ahead of time so you're not caught off guard like this.

Customer: Okay, and... I'm getting the full gigabit speed with that rate?

Agent: Yes, sir. You'd maintain your Gig Fiber service—that's 940 Mbps download speeds—with the $69.99 promotional rate for six months.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I think that's... I mean, that's better than just eating a twenty dollar increase. Can you go ahead and put that on my account?

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely. I'm going to apply the $20 credit for this billing cycle and then switch you over to the loyalty rate of $69.99 per month starting with your next billing period. You should see that reflected in your next bill in about two weeks.

Customer: Okay, great. And you said I'd get a notice before this expires?

Agent: Yes, I'm going to make a note on your account right now, and our system will automatically send you a notification via email and mail about 30 days before your promotion ends. But if you'd prefer, I can also flag your account for a phone call reminder. Would you like me to do that?

Customer: (pause) Actually, yeah. That would be helpful. A phone call would make sure I don't miss it.

Agent: Perfect. I'm putting that down right now. Is the phone number I have on file—the 503 number—the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I've got all that set up for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... I think that takes care of it. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. I really do appreciate your patience and for being a Frontier customer for three years. We value your business. Your confirmation number for these changes is 847-FRN-Q2K9. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, I think we're good.

Agent: Great. Thank you for calling Frontier, and have a wonderful day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (click)
