# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I don't understand what's going on. My internet bill jumped like thirty dollars. I've been with you guys for almost three years and it's always been the same price, and now suddenly it's way more.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account here and take a look at what's happening. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the best phone number to reach you at?

Customer: It's the same number on file.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account now. So I can see that your billing cycle ended on the 15th of this month. Can you tell me what your bill was last month versus what you're seeing now?

Customer: Last month it was $89.99, and this month it's showing $119.99. That's like... that's not okay. Did you guys raise rates or something?

Agent: Let me see what's on your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your service details. You've been on our Fiber 100 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's what I've always had.

Agent: Right, so that plan... (pause) Oh, I see what happened here. So your promotional rate expired. You were on a promotional offer when you first signed up, and that was a two-year promotion. That ended on the 15th of this month, so you're now moving to the regular rate for that service tier.

Customer: Wait, wait. Nobody told me about this. I never... I mean, I should've gotten some kind of notice or something. This is pretty sneaky if you ask me.

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from. Let me check your account to see if we sent out any notifications. (typing sounds) So it looks like we did send out a notification letter about 30 days before your promotion was set to expire. That would've been around... mid-November. Did you perhaps miss that, or...?

Customer: I mean, maybe? I get a lot of mail. But honestly, you could've called me or sent an email or something more obvious. And another thing—why is the price jump so huge? That's almost a 35% increase.

Agent: Yeah, I hear you. The jump is significant. Unfortunately, when promotional rates expire, you do go to our standard pricing, which is higher. But I tell you what—let me see if there's anything I can do for you here. You've been a great customer for three years, and I'd hate to see you frustrated. Let me look into what promotions we might have available.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I mean, I don't want to switch providers or anything, but like, this seems excessive.

Agent: Absolutely. Give me just one second. (typing sounds, longer pause) Okay, so here's what I can do for you. I do have a promotion available for existing customers. I can offer you our Fiber 100 plan at $99.99 for the next 12 months. That would be a $20 savings compared to what you're seeing on this bill. Would that be something that would work for you?

Customer: $99.99? So that's still more than my promotional rate, but...

Agent: I understand it's still higher than what you were paying before, but it's much closer to where you were. And unfortunately, I'm not able to bring it back down to that $89.99 promotional rate. That promotion has ended. But $99.99 for 12 months is about the best I can do on our end.

Customer: (sighs) When would that start?

Agent: This would take effect on your next billing cycle, which would be January 15th. So you would only be charged the higher rate for this one billing cycle, and then starting next month, you'd see the $99.99 rate.

Customer: Alright, I... I mean, that's better than $119.99. Can you like, guarantee that? Like, make sure that actually happens?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to put a note right here on your account about this promotion, and I'm also going to send you an email confirmation with all the details—the rate, the date it starts, everything. That way you have it in writing. How does that sound?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. And when this 12 months is up, what happens then? You're not going to do this to me again, are you?

Agent: (pause) So that's a great question. After the 12 months, you would go back to the standard rate unless another promotion is available at that time. But I would definitely recommend keeping an eye on your account, or you can call us about 30 days before it expires, and we can look at what options are available. Promotions change pretty regularly, so we might have something good for you.

Customer: Okay. Well, I guess that works. I'm still not happy about not being notified better, but...

Agent: I really do apologize for that. I know it's frustrating to see that bill jump. You're definitely not alone in that experience, and I appreciate you giving us the chance to work with you on it. So I'm going to confirm this promotion on your account right now, and you should receive that email within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. And thank you for being a Frontier customer for these three years. We really appreciate your business. You have a great day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
