# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. It's for like... $15.99, and I don't know what it is.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. Can I also get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, Michael. I've got your account here. So you're saying there's a charge you don't recognize?

Customer: Yeah, on this month's bill. It's $15.99 and I have no idea what it is. I only signed up for the internet service, the 500 meg plan, and that's it.

Agent: Got it. Let me take a look at your itemized charges here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing the $15.99 charge. That looks like it's for our premium modem rental fee.

Customer: Wait, modem rental? I thought that came with the service. You guys didn't say anything about that when I signed up three weeks ago.

Agent: Hmm, let me check your account notes here. (pause) Okay, so when you were provisioned, it looks like you were set up with one of our Frontier-owned modems, and that does have a monthly fee of $15.99. However, if you have your own modem that's compatible, you could avoid that charge.

Customer: But the installer didn't tell me about this. He just set it up and left. And honestly, I'm already paying $79.99 for the internet service itself. Why is there an additional fee?

Agent: I understand your frustration, Michael. So the modem rental is a separate line item, and—

Customer: (interrupting) Well, can you just remove it? I mean, I didn't agree to pay for a modem. That seems like it should be included.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, the modem rental is a standard part of our service terms, and I'm not able to remove that charge. However, what I can do is look into whether there was any promotional offer that should have been applied to your account when you signed up.

Customer: (pause) Okay... what kind of promotional offer?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see here. You signed up about three weeks ago, correct?

Customer: Yeah, November 15th.

Agent: Alright, so you would have been eligible for our new customer promotion, which is a $20 credit for the first month. It looks like... (pause, more typing) ...that was applied to your account, so that actually should have reduced your modem fee to basically nothing.

Customer: Okay, so where is that credit?

Agent: (pause) That's a good question. Let me look at your current balance more carefully here. (pause, typing sounds) Oh, I see what happened. That credit was actually applied, but then there was a separate charge that went on your account.

Customer: What charge?

Agent: (pause) It looks like there was a service visit fee of $99.99. Was there... did the technician mention anything about that?

Customer: No! What? There's a hundred dollar charge on here too?

Agent: Okay, I apologize for the confusion here. Let me review your bill summary for you. Can you hold for just one moment while I pull up your full invoice?

Customer: (sighing) Yeah, sure.

Agent: (pause, hold music briefly plays, then ends) Michael? Okay, so I'm looking at this now. It appears the service visit fee was added because you had an installation appointment, and that's a standard $99.99 charge for the technician to come out and set up your service.

Customer: But that's... (pause, frustrated) ...I mean, I get that there's an installation, but nobody told me there was going to be a hundred-dollar charge for that. That seems crazy.

Agent: I completely understand. And I apologize that this wasn't made clear to you during the sign-up process. What happened is the new customer promotion credit of $20 was applied first, and then these additional charges—the modem rental and the service fee—were added on top of that. So your total came to $195.98 in charges with the $20 credit applied.

Customer: This is unbelievable. So my bill is actually like $195?

Agent: For this month, yes, because of the one-time service visit fee. Going forward, your monthly bill would be $95.98 for the internet service plus the modem fee. But Michael, what I can do is—let me see here—I can credit back the installation fee this time. That's a courtesy adjustment I can make.

Customer: (pause) You can do that?

Agent: Yes, I can apply a one-time courtesy credit of $99.99 to your account. That would bring your current bill down to $95.99, which would just be your monthly service charges.

Customer: Okay... well, I mean, I appreciate that, but I'm still not happy about the modem fee. Can you at least waive that for a couple months?

Agent: (pause) Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) Okay, so I can credit you one month of the modem fee, which would be $15.99. How does that sound?

Customer: So that would make my bill this month like... $80?

Agent: That's correct. $79.99 for the internet, which would be your regular monthly charge going forward.

Customer: (pause, slightly less frustrated) Okay, yeah, that's better. And you can definitely remove the hundred-dollar fee?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm applying that courtesy credit right now. (typing sounds) You should see both of those credits reflected on your next bill.

Customer: Alright. And what about my next bill? Will it be the regular $79.99, or...?

Agent: Your next bill should be $95.98, which is your $79.99 internet service plus the $15.99 modem rental fee. But if you want to avoid the modem fee entirely, you're welcome to purchase your own compatible modem. We have a list of approved modems on our website, and you'd just need to set that up yourself.

Customer: Okay, I'll think about that. But for now, this is good.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. I really do apologize again that everything wasn't explained clearly during your sign-up. Is there a number we can reach you at if we need to follow up on anything?

Customer: It's on the account already.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. You should see those credits applied within one to two business days.

Customer: Sounds good. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day, Michael.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.
