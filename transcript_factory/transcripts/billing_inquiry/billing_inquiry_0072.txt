Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I just got my latest statement and there's a charge on here that shouldn't be there.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's the number you're calling from, actually. 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. And just to confirm, is this Derek speaking with... what's your name?

Customer: It's Tom. Tom Richardson.

Agent: Tom, perfect. (pause) Alright, I've got your account here. I'm looking at your most recent bill from last month. What charge are you seeing that concerns you?

Customer: Well, there's this thing... it says "Premium Network Management" and it's like, thirty-five dollars. I never signed up for that. I don't even know what that is.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I see that here. Let me explain what that is. Premium Network Management is our advanced security and performance monitoring service. It helps protect your network from threats and optimizes your speeds. 

Customer: But I didn't ask for it. I don't remember agreeing to that at all. When did this show up on my bill?

Agent: Let me check when that was added to your account. (pause) It looks like it was added about two months ago. Can I ask... did you have any service changes recently? Sometimes when customers upgrade their plan or have us out for a service visit, we'll recommend adding that service.

Customer: No, I haven't had anyone come out. And I haven't upgraded anything. I've had the same plan for like, three years. Three hundred a month, which is already ridiculous if you ask me, and now it's more.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Tom. Let me look into this a little further. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm actually seeing here that there was an outbound call made to this number about eight weeks ago from our sales department. Do you remember speaking with someone from Frontier?

Customer: (sighs) You know what, maybe... there was someone who called? I get a lot of calls. But that doesn't mean I agreed to add something to my bill without being super clear about it. I mean, I should've gotten something in writing, right?

Agent: That's a fair point, and I appreciate you bringing that up. Let me tell you what I can do. I can absolutely remove the Premium Network Management service from your account effective immediately. That'll bring your bill back down to what it was before.

Customer: Wait, really? Just like that?

Agent: Yes, sir. Since there's some question about how it was added, I'm happy to take it off for you right now. I'm going to go ahead and do that. (typing sounds) And I'll also make a note on your account that this was removed per customer request, so there's a record of it.

Customer: Okay, well... I appreciate that. But what about this month? Do I still have to pay that thirty-five dollars since it's already on the bill?

Agent: That's another good question. Let me see what I can do here. (pause) Alright, so normally when a service is removed mid-cycle, the customer would still be responsible for that month. However, given the circumstances, I'm going to credit your account for the full thirty-five dollars. So that charge will be reversed.

Customer: (pause) Oh. Well, hey, that's... that's good. I appreciate that. So my bill goes back to the three hundred?

Agent: Exactly right. Your next bill should show three hundred dollars, and you'll see the credit applied as well. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I... actually, no. I think that's it. This was actually easier than I expected. I was prepared to be on hold for like an hour, so...

Agent: (chuckles) Well, I'm glad we could get it resolved quickly for you, Tom. Is there anything about your current service that you're happy with? Any feedback for us?

Customer: Honestly, the internet speeds are pretty good. That part's fine. It's just... I wish the bills didn't keep going up, you know? But I get it, I guess.

Agent: I hear you. Well, we appreciate your business. If you ever have any issues in the future, feel free to give us a call back. We're here to help.

Customer: Alright, will do. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Tom. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
