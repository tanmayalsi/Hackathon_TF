# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm really confused about my bill. I got charged way more than usual this month and I don't understand why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you figure that out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's, um... (pause) ...555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. Let me pull that up here. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: Sarah Mitchell.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Sarah, I've got your account here. So you're saying your bill was higher than expected this month?

Customer: Yeah, it's like... I've been paying $89.99 for the past two years, and this month my bill shows $129.99. That's like, forty dollars more! I didn't authorize any changes. Did you guys raise your rates or something?

Agent: Let me take a look at your account history here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing... it looks like you were on a promotional rate that expired at the end of last month. Let me explain what happened.

Customer: A promotional rate? Nobody told me about that. I've never heard of this.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for the confusion. It looks like when you signed up two years ago, you were enrolled in an introductory rate of $89.99 per month for 24 months. That contract period ended last month, so your rate has now moved to our standard pricing, which is $129.99 for the Gig Speed Fiber package.

Customer: (frustrated) Wait, so you're telling me you just automatically changed my rate without notifying me? That doesn't seem right. I've been a customer for two years and I feel like... I feel like I should have gotten some kind of warning or something.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Sarah. You know, let me check what communications we may have sent out. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm seeing here that we did send you a notice about the rate change approximately 30 days before the expiration. It would have been sent both via email and mail to your address on file.

Customer: I mean... I get a lot of mail, and my email inbox is crazy. But still, a forty-dollar jump is significant. And honestly, I'm not even sure I need the Gig Speed anymore. Couldn't you downgrade me or something?

Agent: Absolutely, we can definitely look at other options for you. (typing sounds) What kind of speeds are you currently using? Are you streaming a lot, working from home, anything like that?

Customer: I work from home, but it's just me in the apartment. I don't really need the fastest speeds. Something like... I don't know... 200 Mbps or so would probably be fine?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Let me see what we have available. (pause) (typing sounds) So we have our 200 Mbps Fiber plan at $74.99 per month. That would actually bring you back down below your original price point.

Customer: Okay, but that's still different from my original $89.99, right? So my bill would go down?

Agent: Yes, exactly. You'd be paying $74.99 instead of $129.99. That's $55 less per month than what you're being charged now.

Customer: (pause) Well, okay, that's better. But I'm still frustrated that this happened in the first place. I feel like the notification wasn't clear enough or something.

Agent: You know what, Sarah, I hear you. And I appreciate your loyalty as a customer. What I can do for you is I can apply a one-time courtesy credit of $40 to your account to cover the overage from this billing cycle. That would bring your current bill down to what it should be.

Customer: (pause) ...Really? You can do that?

Agent: Yes, I can. And then we'll go ahead and switch you to the 200 Mbps plan going forward, which starts next billing cycle. Does that sound fair?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, actually, that does sound fair. That's... that's really helpful. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome, Sarah. It's the least I can do. Let me just make sure I have all this set up correctly here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm applying a $40 credit to your current bill, and I'm scheduling the plan change to the 200 Mbps Fiber package effective immediately, starting with your next billing cycle on the 15th of next month.

Customer: Okay, great. And my bill next month should be $74.99?

Agent: That's correct. Your next bill on the 15th should reflect the new plan at $74.99 per month, plus any taxes and fees in your area. You should see the credit applied within the next 24 to 48 hours.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you, Derek. I appreciate you helping me out with this.

Agent: My pleasure, Sarah. I'm glad we could get this sorted out for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything.

Agent: Great! Well, thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. If you have any other issues or questions in the future, please don't hesitate to give us a call.

Customer: Will do. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, Sarah. Thank you for calling Frontier!
