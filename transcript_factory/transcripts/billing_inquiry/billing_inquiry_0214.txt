Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and I'm also pretty upset about my internet rate going up. Again.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having billing concerns. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's area code 602, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And can I get a name to go with that account?

Customer: It's Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, Jennifer. I'm pulling up your account now. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing your account here. So you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize and also concerns about a rate increase. Let's start with the unfamiliar charge. Can you tell me what it is, or do you see it on your bill in front of you?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. There's a $12.99 charge for something called "Advanced Security Plus." I never signed up for that. I definitely didn't authorize that.

Agent: Hmm, let me look into that for you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that charge on your account. Can you tell me approximately when that charge first appeared?

Customer: It's on this month's bill, which I received last week. So this is the first time I'm seeing it. And honestly, I don't even know what that feature is supposed to do.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me explain what that is. Advanced Security Plus is an optional add-on service that provides things like malware protection, secure browsing, and identity theft monitoring for your home network. However, I'm not seeing any... (pause) ...I'm not seeing where you initiated this service. Let me check something here.

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I definitely did not sign up for it. I would have remembered that. And I'm already paying for antivirus software on my own computer anyway.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. You know what, I'm going to go ahead and remove that charge from your account right now. This appears to have been added in error, possibly during a previous promotion or account update. I'm going to remove it effective immediately, and you'll see that credit applied to next month's bill.

Customer: Okay, thank you for that. I appreciate it. But I also want to talk about this rate increase. My bill went from $79.99 to $92.50 for the same service. That's almost thirteen dollars more a month. Why is that happening?

Agent: (pause) I understand that's frustrating, Jennifer. Let me pull up your service details here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your plan. You're currently on our Frontier Fiber 500 service, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's what I've had for the past two years, I think. Maybe longer.

Agent: Right, so you've been a great customer with us. I can see you've had continuous service. The rate adjustment you're seeing is due to a couple of factors. First, you were on an introductory rate when you first signed up, and that promotional period has ended. Additionally, there has been a modest increase to our standard rates in your area to help support network maintenance and infrastructure improvements.

Customer: So basically, you're charging me more because the promo is over? That's pretty standard stuff. I feel like companies always do this—they get you in with a low rate and then jack it up after a year or two.

Agent: I hear what you're saying, and I don't blame you for feeling that way. (pause) Let me see what I can do here for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at current promotional offers we have available. We do have a twelve-month promotional rate that I can apply to your account. It would bring your bill down to $84.99 per month for the next year.

Customer: So it's still more than what I was paying, but less than the ninety-two fifty?

Agent: That's correct. It would be $84.99 for the next twelve months, and then after that, it would be subject to the standard rate.

Customer: (pause) I mean... that's something, I guess. But honestly, this whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth. You know? I've been loyal to Frontier. I haven't complained. I've paid my bills on time. And this is how you treat long-term customers?

Agent: I completely understand, and I really appreciate your loyalty, Jennifer. I genuinely do. Let me see if there's anything else I can do for you. (pause, typing sounds) You know what, I'm going to also waive the installation fee on any service upgrade you might want in the future. That's a $99.99 value. And I'm removing that $12.99 charge, plus I'm applying this promotional rate.

Customer: So you're taking off the twelve ninety-nine for this month?

Agent: That's right. That credit will show up on your next bill, and the new promotional rate of $84.99 will start on your next billing cycle.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Okay, I appreciate that. How long is this promo good for, did you say?

Agent: Twelve months from your next billing cycle. So you'll have this rate locked in for the next year.

Customer: And then what happens after that?

Agent: After the twelve months, it would revert to the standard rate for your area, which at that time would likely be $92.50 or potentially adjusted based on any changes to our rates. But you'd receive notice of any changes at least thirty days in advance.

Customer: Alright. Well, I guess I'll give you that. Will I have to call back to renew that promo, or will you reach out to me?

Agent: That's a great question. Typically, you can call us back when you're approaching the end of that promotional period, and we can discuss options at that time. However, I'm going to put a note on your account right now indicating that you're a valued long-term customer, so if you do call back, our representatives will have that context.

Customer: Okay. That sounds fair. And you're sure that charge is being removed?

Agent: Absolutely. I've removed the Advanced Security Plus service and the associated $12.99 charge from your account. You'll see that credit on your next statement.

Customer: Alright, Derek. I appreciate your help with this. I'm still not thrilled about the whole situation, but I feel a little better.

Agent: I'm glad I could help, Jennifer. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and thanks for calling us today. Have a great day, Jennifer.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
