# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. It's like, almost thirty dollars more than what I usually pay.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's, uh... (pause) ...it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's Michael Torres. That's T-O-R-R-E-S.

Agent: (typing) Perfect. Michael Torres. Got it. Let me just... (pause) ...okay, I'm looking at your account now. So I can see your most recent bill is for $129.99, is that the one you're looking at?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Last month I paid like $99.99, and now it's jumped up to almost a hundred and thirty. That's a pretty big jump. I haven't changed anything with my service.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) So I'm reviewing your account history here. Can you tell me what service level you have with us?

Customer: I think it's the Fiber 200? The 200 megabits per second? I've had it for like, two years now.

Agent: (typing) Right, okay. So I see that. Here's what I'm showing on my end, Michael. It looks like there was a promotional rate that ended. You were on a promotional pricing for your first year, which was $99.99 a month. That rate expired on the... (pause) ...on August 15th. So your current bill reflects the regular rate of $129.99 for the Fiber 200 service.

Customer: Wait, what? I wasn't told about this. I mean, nobody called me or sent me anything warning me about this. That's not really fair, you know?

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for the frustration. Let me check something here. (typing sounds) Actually, it looks like we did send a notice about this. According to our system, a notification was mailed to your address about 30 days prior to the rate change. The address we have is 4521 Maple Street in... (pause) ...is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right, but... I mean, I don't always get my mail on time, and honestly, those notices get mixed in with all the junk mail. I feel like there should be more of a heads up than that. This is a pretty big price jump.

Agent: I totally get that. Those notices can sometimes get lost. Let me see what I can do for you here. (typing sounds, pause) You know, I do have the ability to offer you a retention discount. Since you've been a loyal customer for two years, I can put you on a special rate of $109.99 for the next 12 months. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) So it'd still be going up ten dollars from what I was paying before?

Agent: Right, so the promotional rate was the special introductory offer, which is why it was lower. But what I'm offering you now is a significant discount off the regular rate. The standard rate is $129.99, so at $109.99, you're saving $20 a month compared to that. And honestly, that's the best I can do while still keeping you on the Fiber 200 service level.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. Well... I guess that's better than $129.99. But I'm not happy about how this was handled. I really think you guys should do a better job notifying customers about rate changes.

Agent: Your feedback is really valuable, Michael, and I appreciate you bringing that up. I'll make a note in your account about your concerns regarding the notification, and I can definitely pass that along to our management team. These kinds of comments do help us improve our customer communication.

Customer: Okay, fine. I'll take the $109.99. But this is something you guys really need to work on.

Agent: Absolutely. I hear you loud and clear. Let me go ahead and apply that rate to your account right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so your new rate is set at $109.99 per month for the next 12 months, starting with your next billing cycle. You should see that reflected on your statement in about a week or so.

Customer: Alright. And then after the 12 months, what happens? Is it gonna jump back up to $129.99?

Agent: That's a good question. So yes, after the 12-month period, the rate would go back to the standard rate unless we have another promotion available at that time. But what I'd recommend is that you give us a call about 30 days before that offer expires, and we can discuss options with you at that time.

Customer: So you're basically saying I need to call back and negotiate again?

Agent: (pause) Well, I wouldn't necessarily call it negotiation. But I mean, if you reach out to us before the offer expires, we can review your account and see if there are any other options available to you. Sometimes we do have promotional periods coming up, or we can work with you as a valued customer. It's definitely worth reaching out.

Customer: (sighs) Okay. I mean, I guess I don't have much choice here.

Agent: I understand it's frustrating, Michael. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... really, work on the notifications, okay?

Agent: We will. I'm going to add that note to your account right now. (typing sounds) Okay, and I just want to confirm—your new rate of $109.99 is all set. You should receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details. Thank you so much for your business with Frontier, Michael, and I'm sorry again about the frustration with the rate increase.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
