# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I mean, I've been a customer for like three years now, and my internet bill just jumped up like forty bucks. I don't understand why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated with that. I'd be happy to look into this for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's the number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing your account for the residence in... Maple Grove?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. And I can see your billing here. So your most recent bill was issued on the 15th, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that one. It was like... I think it was $119.99, and last month it was $79.99. That's a forty-dollar difference, Derek. I didn't opt into anything. I didn't call and ask for faster speeds or anything like that.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Let me look at what changed on your account. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your service history here, and it looks like on the 8th of this month, your promotional rate expired.

Customer: What do you mean, promotional rate? I... when I signed up, nobody told me it was temporary. They said it was thirty-nine ninety-nine, and that's what I've been paying for three years.

Agent: I hear you. So when you originally signed up, you would have had a promotional rate for the first twelve months typically. After that first year, your rate would have adjusted to the standard rate for your service tier. It looks like your promotional period was extended, but that extension has now ended.

Customer: So you're telling me that I've been grandfathered in this whole time, and now you're just... you're just raising my rates? That doesn't seem right to me.

Agent: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the confusion. Sometimes the explanation of promotional periods isn't as clear as it should be. Let me see what options I have available for you. What speed tier are you currently on?

Customer: I don't... I don't even know. Whatever the standard is. It works fine for what I need—streaming, checking email, whatever.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so you're on our Fiber 100 plan, which is 100 megabits per second download. And actually, looking at what's available right now, I can offer you a new promotional rate. We have a special running that I can apply to your account. I could get you back to $79.99 a month for the next twelve months, and that would reset your promotional period.

Customer: So for another year it's back to eighty bucks, and then what? It jumps up again?

Agent: So after that twelve-month promotional period, yes, you would see an increase to our standard rate, which... (pause) ...which would be $109.99 for that same service tier. But that's something we could discuss when the time comes. You could always reach out to us again, and we might have other options available at that time. Promotional offers change frequently.

Customer: (sighs) This is just... it's frustrating, you know? I've been a loyal customer. I've never missed a payment. And it feels like you're just nickel-and-diming people.

Agent: I really do hear you, and I appreciate your loyalty over these three years. That matters to us. This is honestly a pretty standard practice in the industry, but I understand it doesn't make it any less frustrating for you. The good news is I can apply this promotional rate effective immediately, and that'll bring your next bill back down.

Customer: When would that take effect?

Agent: It would take effect on your next billing cycle, which looks like... (typing sounds) ...the 15th of next month. So you'd see the reduced rate reflected on that bill.

Customer: Okay. And you're sure there's nothing else I'm getting charged for that I shouldn't be? Like, are there any fees or anything?

Agent: Let me review your bill itemization here. (pause, typing sounds) No, I'm not seeing any unusual fees. You have your Internet service at $119.99, a modem rental fee of $9.99—

Customer: Wait, I'm renting my modem? I didn't know that.

Agent: Yes, that's included in most of our plans. However, if you'd like, you can purchase your own modem, and we'd remove that fee from your bill. That would save you about ten dollars a month.

Customer: Really? I can do that? Why didn't anyone mention this before?

Agent: That's a great question. It should have been discussed with you, and I apologize that it wasn't. But yes, absolutely. You can purchase a compatible modem from pretty much any electronics retailer or online. It's a one-time cost, usually between sixty and a hundred dollars depending on the model, but you'd save that modem fee every month going forward.

Customer: Okay, so if I bought a modem, my bill would be... what, around a hundred dollars with the promotional rate?

Agent: Exactly. Around $99.99 with the promotional pricing. And then $109.99 after the promotional period ends.

Customer: (pause) Alright. I guess that's... that's better than one-twenty. Can you send me like, information about which modems work with your service?

Agent: Absolutely. I can have that sent to the email on file for your account right now. I'll include a list of compatible modems and instructions on how to set it up yourself. It's actually pretty straightforward—most people can do it in about five or ten minutes.

Customer: Okay. And so to confirm, you're applying the promotional rate right now? For the twelve months?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, I'm applying it to your account right now. You should see confirmation in an email within the next few minutes. And just to summarize everything: your new rate will be $79.99 for the next twelve months, effective on your next billing cycle. I'm sending you information about purchasing your own modem, which would save you an additional $9.99 per month. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this, Derek. I do still think you guys should be more transparent about this stuff, but... I appreciate it.

Agent: I really appreciate that feedback, and I'm sorry again for the frustration. Your loyalty over these three years means a lot to us, and we want to keep you as a Frontier customer. If you ever have any issues with your service or if you want to reach out before your next promotional period ends, please don't hesitate to call us back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
