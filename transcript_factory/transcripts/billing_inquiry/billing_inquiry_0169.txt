# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my monthly rate went up. I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, Michael. I've got your account pulled up here. So you mentioned a charge you don't recognize and a rate increase. Let me take a look at your most recent bill. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your bill from this month. What's the charge that's standing out to you?

Customer: Well, there's like a $15 charge that just says "Equipment Rental Fee" and I... I already own my router. I bought my own modem years ago. Why am I being charged to rent equipment I don't use?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me look into that for you. (typing sounds) Hmm, so I'm seeing here that you do have your own equipment registered on the account, so that's... that's unusual. Can I ask, did you receive any kind of notice about this charge, or did it just appear on your bill?

Customer: It just showed up. Like, no warning or anything. I've been with Frontier for five years and I've never been charged this before. That's why I'm calling. It doesn't make sense.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Michael. Let me look into the history here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like there may have been a system update on your account around... let me see... about six weeks ago. It's possible that when we migrated some accounts in your area, the system didn't properly carry over your equipment notation.

Customer: So it's a mistake?

Agent: It appears to be a system error, yes. I can absolutely remove that charge and make sure it doesn't appear again. I'll add a note to your account right now that you have customer-owned equipment. (typing sounds) Done. So that takes care of the $15 charge.

Customer: Okay, good. But what about the rate increase? My bill went from like $79 a month to $89. That's ten dollars! I haven't seen an increase like that in a long time.

Agent: (pause) Let me check the service plan details here. (typing sounds) So, I'm seeing that you're on our standard Gig Fiber plan. Your previous rate was locked in under a promotional rate that expired on... looks like the first of this month. So you're moving to our standard rate for that service tier.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me I was on some kind of deal the whole time and nobody told me it was going to expire?

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. The promotional rate typically comes with a specified term length. Let me see what's listed here... (pause) It looks like that was a 24-month promotional rate, so it would have expired this month. You should have received a notice about the expiration. Did you receive something in the mail, or...?

Customer: I mean, I get so much mail from you guys, I honestly don't know. But if I'm gonna see a ten-dollar jump, I feel like that should be more obvious, you know?

Agent: I completely hear you. You know what, let me see what options we have available to you. (typing sounds, longer pause) Okay, so I can offer you a new promotional rate for 12 months at $74.99 a month, which would actually be lower than what you were paying before. How does that sound?

Customer: That's... okay, that's better. Why wasn't that offered to me before I had to call?

Agent: That's a fair point. I apologize that we didn't reach out proactively. I can definitely note on your account that you'd like to be contacted before any rate changes in the future. I'm going to go ahead and apply this promotional rate to your account right now. (typing sounds) And this will take effect on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay. So to clarify—the equipment charge is gone, and my rate is going down to $74.99?

Agent: That's correct. You'll see both changes reflected on your next bill. The $15 equipment fee will be removed, and your monthly service charge will be $74.99 for the next 12 months.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that, Derek. But going forward, can you guys maybe communicate better about this stuff? It's annoying having to call in every time something changes.

Agent: Absolutely, and I've added that request to your account. I'll also be sending you a confirmation email with the details of your new rate and the service adjustments we made today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that covers it.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for calling Frontier, Michael, and thank you for being a loyal customer for five years. We really appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Take care!
