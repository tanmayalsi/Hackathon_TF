# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling about my bill. I got my statement yesterday and I'm pretty frustrated right now.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one second here... alright, I've got you pulled up. I see an account for Sarah Chen at 4521 Maple Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So what's going on with your bill that's got you frustrated?

Customer: Well, my bill jumped up thirty-five dollars this month. Thirty-five dollars! I was paying 79.99 for my internet, and now it's showing 114.99. I didn't authorize any changes, and I didn't call in asking for faster speeds or anything like that. I want to know why this happened.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Sarah. Let me look into this for you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history here. I do see that your rate increased on your last billing cycle. Let me see what plan you were on...

Customer: I was on the 300 Mbps plan, and honestly, I don't even need anything faster than that. We just use it for streaming and working from home. Why would they increase my price without calling me?

Agent: That's a great question. So, I'm seeing here that you were on a promotional rate of 79.99. That promotional period was for twelve months, and it looks like that twelve-month period ended with your last billing cycle.

Customer: (pause) So it's just... expired? Like, they got me in the door with a low price and now they're charging me regular price?

Agent: I know it can feel that way, and I appreciate your frustration. These promotional rates are, unfortunately, time-limited. Once that period ends, the rate goes to our standard pricing for that service tier. In your case, 300 Mbps fiber internet is 114.99 a month.

Customer: That's ridiculous. I've been a customer for... (pause) ...I want to say about three years now, and I've never had any issues. I pay my bill on time every month. Couldn't you just keep me on that promotional rate?

Agent: (typing sounds) I hear you, and I really appreciate your loyalty. Let me see what options I have available. (pause) So, while I can't extend the original promotional rate, I do have the ability to offer you a courtesy adjustment or look into other plans that might work better for your budget.

Customer: What do you mean, "other plans"?

Agent: Well, we have a couple of options. I could put you on our 200 Mbps plan, which is 64.99 a month. That's actually a good option for streaming and working from home like you mentioned. Or, I can give you a discount on your current 300 Mbps plan. What would be more interesting to you?

Customer: Well, I don't want to downgrade my speed. I like having the faster internet. Can you do a discount on the 300 Mbps?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me see what I can do here... (longer pause, typing sounds) Okay, so what I'm able to offer you is to bring your rate down to 99.99 a month for the next twelve months. That's a twenty-dollar reduction from the standard rate, and it would give you another promotional period to lock in that pricing.

Customer: So I'd still be paying twenty more dollars than what I was paying before, but at least it's not the full 114?

Agent: That's right. I know it's not exactly what you were paying before, but this is honestly the best offer I have available in my system right now. The alternative would be to adjust your plan down to 200 Mbps at 64.99, which would save you quite a bit, but I understand you want to keep your current speeds.

Customer: (pause) ...How long would that new promotional rate last?

Agent: That would be for twelve months, just like your last one. And then after that, if you want, you could call back in and we could look at what offers are available at that time. But this pricing would be guaranteed through your twelfth billing cycle from now.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, I guess that's... I mean, it's not great, but it's better than what I saw on my bill. And you're saying this starts right away?

Agent: It would start on your next billing cycle, yes. So your next bill should reflect the 99.99 rate.

Customer: Alright. And just so I'm clear—I'm not locked into anything crazy, right? I can still cancel anytime if I want?

Agent: Correct. You can cancel anytime without any early termination fees. This is just the promotional pricing offer.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I'll take it. I appreciate you working with me on this, even if I'm still not thrilled about the price increase.

Agent: I really appreciate that, Sarah. And I'm sorry that the promotion ended right when it did—I know that's frustrating. Let me just confirm everything on my end here. (typing sounds) Perfect. So I've applied the $99.99 rate to your account for twelve months, effective your next billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks.

Agent: You're very welcome. We really appreciate your business, and thanks for being a Frontier customer. If you need anything else in the future, don't hesitate to give us a call.

Customer: I will. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Take care, Sarah. Have a great day.

Customer: You too.
