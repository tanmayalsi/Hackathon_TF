Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually, I do recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what name is the account under?

Customer: Patricia Hernandez. H-E-R-N-A-N-D-E-Z.

Agent: Perfect, Patricia. I've got your account pulled up here. I can see you're a long-time customer with us. What charge are you disputing today?

Customer: Well, my bill went up. Like, significantly. Last month I was paying $79.99 for the Fiber 200 package, and this month it's showing $99.99. That's... that's like a twenty dollar increase. I didn't authorize that.

Agent: (pause) I understand your frustration. Let me look into that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that you were on a promotional rate that expired at the end of last month. That promotion was a twelve-month introductory offer, and...

Customer: Wait, wait. Promotional rate? I've had this service for three years. Nobody told me anything about a promotional rate expiring.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me pull up your account history here. (typing sounds) So it looks like you enrolled in that promotional pricing back in... September of 2021. You were locked in at that rate for the first year of service, and then it appears there may not have been a clear notification when that period ended.

Customer: Three years, Derek. I've been paying the same amount for three years. Why would it suddenly jump now?

Agent: That's a fair question. (pause) So, looking at your account more carefully, it seems like after the initial twelve-month promotion expired, you should have transitioned to our standard rate at that time. However, it looks like the system kept you at the promotional pricing for an additional two years, which was... well, that was an error on our part.

Customer: Oh. So... so you're saying I was actually supposed to be charged more?

Agent: Actually, no, that's not quite what I'm saying. What I'm seeing is that you weren't being charged the full amount you should have been, and now the system has corrected itself. However, I absolutely want to make this right for you. You were a loyal customer during that entire period, and the fact that you didn't receive proper notification is on us.

Customer: So what are my options here? Am I just... stuck with this new price?

Agent: Not necessarily. Let me see what I can do for you. (typing sounds) We do have some options for long-term customers like yourself. One thing I can offer is a new promotional rate. We have a twelve-month offer right now where I can get your Fiber 200 package down to $84.99 per month. That's lower than your new standard rate.

Customer: $84.99? That's still five dollars more than what I was paying.

Agent: I hear you. That is an increase from what you've been paying. But here's the thing—I can also apply a one-time service credit to your account as a gesture of goodwill for the lack of notification regarding the rate change. I could credit you fifty dollars, which would help offset some of that jump.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I mean, that's something. But can you do better than that? I've been with you for three years without any issues. I pay on time every month.

Agent: (pause) Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) You know what? Because of your loyalty and because this is our error in not communicating the rate change properly, I'm going to apply a seventy-five dollar credit to your account today. That would bring your first month of the new promotional rate to just under ten dollars.

Customer: And then after that first month, it goes to $84.99?

Agent: That's correct. And this new promotional rate would be locked in for twelve months. After that, we can look at options again before any rate change.

Customer: (pause) Alright. That's... that's fair. Can I ask one more thing though? Is there any way to get it lower than $84.99? Like, I see these commercials for new customers getting $49.99.

Agent: (hesitates) That's for new customers only, unfortunately. But I will tell you what—I'm going to make a note on your account. When this twelve-month promotion ends, if you call us back, flag this conversation, and ask to speak with a retention specialist, they'll have more flexibility to help you out. And honestly, if you've been a good customer, which you have, they're usually willing to work with you.

Customer: Okay. I appreciate that. So just to confirm—the seventy-five dollar credit goes on this month's bill, and then I'm locked in at $84.99 for the next twelve months?

Agent: Exactly right. And your service remains the same—you've still got Fiber 200, all the same speeds and performance.

Customer: Alright. Can you send me confirmation of all this in an email?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll send that right over to the email address we have on file. Is that still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yes, that's it.

Agent: Perfect. I'm sending that now, and it should arrive within the next few minutes. (typing sounds) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for working with me on this, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Patricia. I really do appreciate your business, and I apologize again for the confusion with the rate change. We'll make sure you're taken care of. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
