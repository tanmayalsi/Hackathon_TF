Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's like a $25 increase on there that I wasn't expecting. Can you explain what that's about?

Agent: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Okay, one second here... (pause) Alright, I've got your account up. I'm looking at your most recent bill from December. Is that the one you're referring to?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Last month it was $79.99, and now it's like $105. That's almost a 30 percent increase. I've been with you guys for... I don't know, three years now? And I've never had my bill jump like this.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me take a closer look at what changed. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you had a promotional rate that expired. You were on our Fiber 200 plan with a two-year promotional price. That promotion ended on November 30th, so your rate adjusted to our standard pricing starting in December.

Customer: Wait, what? A promotional rate? Nobody told me about this. I mean, I don't remember getting anything in the mail about it expiring.

Agent: I apologize for the confusion. Typically we do send out notification letters about 30 days before a promotional rate ends. Let me check here... (typing) Yes, it looks like a notice was mailed out on October 15th. Did you perhaps receive that and maybe it got mixed in with other mail?

Customer: (sighs) I mean, maybe? I don't know. I don't remember seeing anything about it. So you're telling me this is just... permanent? I'm stuck paying $105 a month now?

Agent: Well, that's actually a great question, and I'm glad you called in. We do have some options here. Since you've been such a loyal customer for three years, I can apply a new promotional rate to your account. (typing) Let me see what I can do...

Customer: Okay, that would be helpful because I'm honestly thinking about switching to cable. I saw an ad for [inaudible] the other day.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what we've got available. (typing, pause) Alright, so I can offer you our current promotion for existing customers. It's Fiber 300 Mbps—that's actually an upgrade from your current 200 Mbps—and I can get you back down to $84.99 a month for 12 months. After that, it would go to standard pricing, which would be $99.99, but you'd get that same notification ahead of time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so it's still going up from what I was paying before, but it's better than the $105? And I get faster internet?

Agent: Exactly. You get 50% more speed, so you'd go from 200 to 300 Mbps, and you'd be at $84.99 instead of the $105. Plus, you get our 12-month price lock guarantee with this promotion.

Customer: (pause) I guess that's... better. Yeah, okay. I can do that. But I want to make sure I'm not going to be surprised again. Like, can you make a note on my account or something?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to add a note right now that says to send you advanced notification about any rate changes. (typing) And when we send that notice, I'd recommend you give us a call to see what promotional options are available at that time, okay?

Customer: Okay, yeah. I appreciate that. So when does this new rate take effect?

Agent: Great question. This will take effect on your next billing cycle, which starts on January 8th. So your next bill should reflect the new rate of $84.99 and the upgraded speed.

Customer: And how long is my service going to be interrupted for you to upgrade the speed?

Agent: That's actually the best part—there's no service interruption at all. The upgrade happens completely on our back end. You shouldn't experience any downtime.

Customer: Oh, that's nice. Okay, I think I'm good then. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course! I'm really glad I could help, and thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too, bye!

Agent: Bye now!
