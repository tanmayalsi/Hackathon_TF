# FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged $127 this month and last month I was paying $79. That's almost a fifty dollar increase and nobody told me about this.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account here and take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my home phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now... Got it. I see your account. Your name is Michael Patterson?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Alright, Michael. I'm looking at your billing history here. I do see the increase you're referring to. Let me see what happened... (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate expired. You were on a 12-month promotional offer at $79.99 per month for our Fiber 200 service, and that promotion ended on March 15th. Your rate has moved to the regular pricing, which is $127.95 per month.

Customer: Wait, wait. I never agreed to any promotional rate. I've been a customer for like... I don't know, three years maybe? And I've been paying $79 the whole time. Nobody told me anything was going to change.

Agent: (pause) Okay, let me look into this a bit more. Sometimes these promotions are applied at the time of installation or during an upgrade. Do you remember when you started service with us, or if you've made any changes to your account in the past couple years?

Customer: I mean, I've been with you guys for about three years. I signed up online, I think. Or maybe someone came to the house... honestly, it's been a while. But my point is, I shouldn't have been surprised with a fifty dollar increase without some kind of notice.

Agent: You know, that's a fair point. And I can see why you'd be upset. Let me check... (typing sounds) According to your account, I do show that we sent a notice to your address about 30 days before the rate change took effect. It would have been sent around the middle of February. Did you happen to receive anything in the mail from us?

Customer: I might have gotten something, but like... I get a ton of mail, and I don't always read every piece of mail I get. You'd think you'd call me or email me or something more direct than just hoping I see some piece of paper in the mail.

Agent: That's definitely fair feedback, and I appreciate you sharing that. We do typically send notices in the mail, but I understand that things can get missed. So what I can do for you today is... let me see what options we have. (pause, typing sounds) 

Customer: What are my options exactly? Because if this is just how it's going to be, then I need to look into switching to someone else. I saw that Comcast is running some specials in my area.

Agent: I totally get it. Let me see what we can do here to keep you as a valued customer. One second... Okay, so looking at your account and your history with us—you've been a customer for three years, you're in good standing, no payment issues—I can offer you a new promotional rate. We have a 12-month promotion for $89.99 per month on the Fiber 200 service. That's not quite the $79 you were paying before, but it's a significant discount from the $127.95 regular price.

Customer: (pause) So you're still raising my rate by ten bucks a month compared to what I was paying before?

Agent: I understand how that feels, but—

Customer: I mean, I'm just saying, if I was grandfathered in at $79, why can't I stay at $79?

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, once a promotional period expires, we can't extend it at the exact same rate. But what I can tell you is that $89.99 is the best rate I can offer you in this situation for a 12-month commitment. And after that 12 months, if you want to call us back before it expires, we can usually work something out for you again. A lot of our long-term customers cycle through promotions that way.

Customer: (sighing) So you're saying I'd be locked into another contract for a year?

Agent: Yes, there would be a 12-month term on this promotional rate. If you left before that, there would be an early termination fee of $99. But if you stick with us, then yes, you'd have that rate for a full year, and then we can look at options again when it's coming up.

Customer: Hmm. And what if I just drop down to a lower speed tier? Do you have anything cheaper?

Agent: (typing sounds) We do. We have our Fiber 100 service, which is our entry-level tier. That would normally be $69.95 per month, but with a current promotion, I could get you that at $59.99 per month for 12 months. That's actually lower than your original rate.

Customer: What's the difference between that and what I have now? I have 200?

Agent: Right, so Fiber 200 gives you 200 megabits per second download speeds, and Fiber 100 gives you 100 megabits per second. For most households, 100 megs is plenty for streaming, web browsing, video calls, that kind of thing. If you have multiple people using the internet heavily at the same time—like gaming and streaming simultaneously—you might notice a difference. But for the average user, it's solid.

Customer: (pause) I mean... I do work from home sometimes, and my wife streams TV while my son's doing schoolwork. So I'm not sure if dropping to 100 would work.

Agent: In that case, honestly, the $89.99 rate for the Fiber 200 is probably your best bet. You keep the faster speeds you're used to, and we bring your bill down significantly from that $127.95.

Customer: (longer pause) Okay, so walk me through this. I'm at $89.99 for 12 months, and then what happens?

Agent: Then after those 12 months are up, your rate would typically go to the regular rate of $127.95 again. But as I mentioned, if you call us before that happens—maybe a month or two before your promotion ends—we can usually work something out with you. We'd prefer to keep you as a customer and negotiate than lose you to a competitor.

Customer: Right, so basically I'm just pushing the problem down the road.

Agent: (pause) I mean, in some ways, yes. But that's pretty standard in the industry. The idea is you get a discounted rate, you're locked in at that price for a year, and then we both can reassess. For a lot of customers, especially long-term ones like yourself, we're able to keep rates competitive. It's better than facing a sudden increase with no warning, which is kind of what happened this time.

Customer: (sighing) Alright, fine. Go ahead and put me on the $89.99 plan for 12 months. But I'm going to write down my promotion end date, and I'm going to call you before it expires, because I'm not dealing with this surprise again.

Agent: Perfect. I think that's the smart move. Let me just confirm a couple of things and get this set up for you. So we're looking at Fiber 200 service at $89.99 per month for 12 months, starting immediately. This will replace your current rate. You're locked in for 12 months, and if you cancel before that, there's a $99 early termination fee. And I'm going to make a note right here on your account that you want to be contacted 30 days before your promotion expires to discuss renewal options. (typing sounds)

Customer: Yeah, thank you. I appreciate that.

Agent: Okay, you're all set. Your new rate of $89.99 will show up on your next billing cycle. So your next bill should reflect that change. You should receive a confirmation email as well within the next hour or so. Your promotion will expire on... (pause) April 15th of next year. Make a note of that.

Customer: April 15th. Got it.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. I think we're good.

Agent: Great. Well, Michael, thank you for being a Frontier customer for the past three years, and I really appreciate you giving us the opportunity to make this right today. If you need anything in the future, feel free to reach out to us anytime.

Customer: Thanks. I will.

Agent: Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
