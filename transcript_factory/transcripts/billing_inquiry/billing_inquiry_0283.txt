# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Plus, my price went up and nobody told me about it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account and take a look. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one second here... I've got your account. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. What charge are you seeing that you don't recognize?

Customer: There's like a $45 charge on here that says "equipment rental fee" but I own my router. I bought that thing three years ago. Why am I suddenly being charged for something I own?

Agent: (pause) Okay, let me look into that. That's definitely something we need to clarify. Can you tell me... do you have a modem and a router, or just the one device?

Customer: I have both. I have the modem that you guys sent me, and then I have my own Netgear router that I bought myself. I'm not renting anything from you.

Agent: (typing sounds) Right, that makes sense. So looking at your account here, it appears that on your last billing cycle, there was an upgrade to your service, and somehow our system flagged your router as a rental unit. That's... that shouldn't have happened. I apologize for that.

Customer: So you're saying that's a mistake?

Agent: It does appear to be a system error on our end. However, before we address that, you also mentioned your price went up. Let me see... (pause) I'm showing that your plan went from $79.99 to $94.99 this month. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yes! Exactly. That's almost fifteen dollars more. I've been a customer for what, five or six years now? And I never got any notice about this.

Agent: I understand your frustration. (pause) Okay, so we do have... let me explain what happened here. You were on a promotional rate that was set to expire after twelve months. That promotional pricing just ended, so you've moved to our standard rate for the Fiber 500 plan.

Customer: But nobody told me about that. I didn't sign up for a price increase.

Agent: I hear you. You should have received a notice about the promotion ending... typically 30 days before the rate change takes effect. Let me check if that notice was sent. (typing sounds) Hmm, it looks like we may not have your current email address on file, so the notification might not have reached you. I apologize for that. That's on us.

Customer: So what am I supposed to do? I can't just absorb a fifteen-dollar increase. That adds up.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what options we have. (pause) What I can do is credit back the $45 equipment rental charge since that was a system error—that's definite. As for the price increase, let me look at what promotions we currently have available... (typing sounds) We do have a retention offer I can apply to your account. We can bring your rate down to $84.99 for the next twelve months. How does that sound?

Customer: So that's still like five dollars more than what I was paying before.

Agent: Yes, so there would be a $5 increase, but that would lock in your rate for another year, and after that promotional period ends, we'd give you advance notice so you can make an informed decision.

Customer: (pause) What if I shop around? I know Comcast has fiber in my area now.

Agent: That's certainly your choice. I'd hate to lose you as a customer though. You've been with us for six years, and I want to make sure we're taking care of you. Let me see if there's anything else I can do... (typing sounds) Okay, what if I could get you our Fiber 500 plan for $79.99 for six months, and then it goes to $87.99 for the following six months? That way you get a little more time at your original rate, and a smaller increase when it adjusts.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's... that's better. But I want that in writing, you know? I don't want to get surprised again.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all of these details before we end this call. You'll have documentation of the new pricing, the timeline, and the $45 credit. And that $45 credit should appear on your next bill.

Customer: Alright. And I'm going to update my email address while I'm on the phone with you, just so I get those notices next time.

Agent: That's smart. (pause) What email would you like me to update that to?

Customer: It's jennifer.torres at gmail dot com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got that updated. Jennifer, is that correct?

Customer: Yes.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) So just to recap what we've done here: I'm crediting the $45 equipment rental fee to your account, I'm applying a promotional rate of $79.99 for the first six months and $87.99 for the next six months, and I'm updating your email address to jennifer.torres@gmail.com so you'll receive all future notifications about your account. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for working with me on that.

Agent: You're very welcome. And again, I apologize for the confusion with the notification and the equipment rental charge. We appreciate your business, and I hope you'll stick with us. Is there anything about your service itself—the internet speed or anything like that—that you'd like to discuss?

Customer: No, the service has been great actually. It's just the billing stuff that's been frustrating.

Agent: I totally get it. Well, thanks again for calling Frontier, and we'll get that confirmation email over to you in just a few minutes. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: Thank you!
