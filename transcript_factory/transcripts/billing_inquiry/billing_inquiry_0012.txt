Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my rate went up. I've been a customer for like four years and I'm pretty frustrated right now.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you're frustrated. Let me pull up your account and take a look at what's going on. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now... and I'm seeing an account for Sarah Mitchell at 42 Oakwood Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned a charge you don't recognize and a rate increase. Let me look at your most recent bill here. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your account. Can you tell me which charge you're questioning?

Customer: Well, there's a $49.99 charge that just showed up last month. I've never seen that before. And then my monthly service went from $79.99 to $99.99, which is a twenty dollar jump. That's ridiculous.

Agent: I hear you. Twenty dollars is definitely a significant increase. Let me look into both of those for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so the $49.99 charge... can you tell me approximately when that appeared on your bill? Was it on last month's statement or this month's?

Customer: This bill I just received, so it would be... the statement date is like three days ago.

Agent: Got it. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing that charge here. That appears to be... it looks like a router rental fee. Were you provided a new router or modem recently?

Customer: What? A router rental? I didn't ask for a new router. I've had the same one for... I don't know, years. Why would I suddenly be charged for that?

Agent: That's a great question, and I understand the confusion. Let me look into your account notes here to see if there was any service visit or equipment change. (typing sounds) (pause) I'm not seeing anything recent in your account that would explain this charge appearing. It's possible this was added in error, or there may have been a system issue. I can definitely look into this further for you.

Customer: Can you just remove it? I don't want to rent a router. I have my own equipment.

Agent: Absolutely, I can help with that. Before I do though, let me also address the rate increase you mentioned, because those two things might be connected. (pause) Looking at your account, I'm seeing that your service package changed about two months ago. It looks like you were automatically moved from our Fiber 50 plan to our Fiber 75 plan. Do you remember that happening?

Customer: No, I definitely don't remember that. Why would that happen without me asking?

Agent: That's... that's a really good question. It appears there may have been an auto-upgrade on your account. I'm not seeing any notes about you requesting this change. (typing sounds) Let me pull up what actually triggered this. (pause) I apologize—it looks like this may have been a system error on our end. The good news is I can absolutely revert you back to your original Fiber 50 plan, which would bring your rate back down to the $79.99 that you were paying.

Customer: Okay, well yeah, I want to go back to what I was paying before. And what about that router charge?

Agent: You got it. So I'm going to do two things for you right now. First, I'm going to remove that $49.99 router rental charge from your account—that's being credited back to you effective immediately. And second, I'm going to downgrade you back to the Fiber 50 plan, which will bring your monthly rate back down to $79.99 starting with your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay, good. So I'm going to see credits on my next bill?

Agent: Yes, exactly. You'll see the $49.99 credit applied to your next statement, and then your rate will adjust back to $79.99 going forward. (pause) Now, I do want to let you know that normally we would notify customers about any plan changes, so I'm going to put a note on your account to make sure this doesn't happen again. And if you ever want to upgrade in the future, we'll always contact you first to confirm.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. But I'm still frustrated that this happened in the first place without my permission.

Agent: And you have every right to be, and I sincerely apologize for that. This shouldn't have happened. Is there anything else I can do for you today?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that's it. Just make sure this doesn't happen again.

Agent: I will absolutely make sure of that. I'm going to have a supervisor review your account to make sure everything is set correctly, and I'm putting a clear note that no changes should be made without your direct authorization. Your confirmation code for these changes is 447829. Would you like me to email that to you or text it?

Customer: Email is fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'll send that right over. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thank you.

Agent: Well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We really appreciate your business, and we'll make sure this gets taken care of. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
