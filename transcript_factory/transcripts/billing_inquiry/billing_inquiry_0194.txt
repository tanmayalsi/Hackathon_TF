# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, Derek. Yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. My bill went up like thirty dollars, and I'm not sure why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Uh, yeah it's 555-0147. That's the number on my bill.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up for you here. One moment... (pause) Alright, I've got your account. I'm seeing your account is under the name Michael Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So I'm looking at your most recent bill here from December, and I can see the increase you're referring to. Can you tell me what the charge is that you don't recognize? Or is it the overall bill amount that went up?

Customer: The overall thing went up. Last month I was paying like $89.99, and this month it's showing $119.99. That's almost thirty bucks more. I haven't changed anything, so I'm not sure what's going on.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me take a closer look at what services you're on. (typing sounds) Okay, so you're currently on our Fiber 500 plan, is that what you signed up for?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. I've been with you guys for about two years now, and my bill has always been around ninety bucks. So something changed.

Agent: Right, okay. So I'm seeing here that your promotional rate expired at the end of November. You were on a promotional rate of $79.99 for the first year, and then it adjusted to $89.99 for your second year. But now that we're into month 25 of your service, your promotional pricing has ended completely, and you're at our standard rate of $119.99 for the Fiber 500 plan.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me the price just... changed? Without telling me?

Agent: (pause) Well, we do send out notifications when promotional rates are set to expire. Let me check your account here to see what notifications were sent out. (typing sounds) I'm seeing that we sent you an email notification on November 15th about the rate change effective December 1st. Did you happen to receive that?

Customer: I... I don't know. Maybe? I get so many emails. But that's pretty frustrating. I wish there was more of a heads up or something. Is there anything you can do about this?

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what options we have here. (pause, typing sounds) So typically, once a promotional period ends, customers move to standard pricing. However, I do see that we have a current promotion running for existing customers. I could potentially offer you a discounted rate if you're interested in extending your service agreement.

Customer: What kind of discount are we talking about?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm showing that I can offer you our Fiber 500 plan at $99.99 per month for the next 12 months if you agree to a two-year service agreement.

Customer: So I'd be paying $99.99 instead of $119.99?

Agent: That's correct. That would save you $20 per month, which would bring your bill closer to what you were paying before.

Customer: Hmm. But I mean, I don't want to sign another two-year agreement. That seems like a lot. Why would I do that?

Agent: That's a fair question. Without the service agreement, I'm limited in what I can offer. The promotion we have running does require a two-year commitment. However, you'd save $240 over the year compared to the standard rate, and it's only $10 more than your current bill. Plus, you'd have the peace of mind knowing your rate is locked in.

Customer: (pause) Can I think about it?

Agent: Of course, absolutely. You don't have to decide right now. But I will say that this promotion is available through the end of the month, so you'd want to let us know before then if you'd like to take advantage of it.

Customer: Okay. So if I do nothing, my bill just stays at $119.99?

Agent: Yes, unless you'd like to downgrade to a lower tier plan. We also have a Fiber 300 plan at $99.99 per month without any commitment required, if you'd like to look at that option.

Customer: What's the difference between 500 and 300?

Agent: The Fiber 500 gives you 500 megabits per second download speed, while the Fiber 300 gives you 300 megabits per second. Most customers find that the 300 is more than sufficient for streaming, gaming, browsing, that sort of thing.

Customer: (pause) You know what, I live alone and I'm not a huge gamer or anything. I might be okay with that. How would that work?

Agent: Okay, so if you'd like to make that change, I can go ahead and process that for you right now. Your new bill would be $99.99 per month starting with your next billing cycle on January 5th. There's no commitment required, so you could always upgrade back to the 500 plan later if you need the faster speed.

Customer: Yeah, let's do that. That makes more sense than paying $120.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm processing that change now. (pause) Alright, that's all set. Your service tier has been downgraded from Fiber 500 to Fiber 300, and your new rate of $99.99 per month will take effect on your next billing date. You should see that reflected on your next bill.

Customer: Great. So my bill next month should be around $100 instead of $120?

Agent: Yes, exactly. It'll be $99.99, so approximately $100. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for helping me out, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael. I'm glad we were able to find a solution that works for you. If you have any other questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to give us a call. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
