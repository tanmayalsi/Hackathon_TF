Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize. Or actually, I do recognize it, but it shouldn't be there.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having an issue with your bill. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment while I pull up your account here... All right, I've got you. I'm showing an account under the name Michael Torres. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize or you have a question about. Can you tell me which charge that is?

Customer: Yeah, so I've been paying $79.99 a month for my Fiber 300 plan, right? And this month my bill came in at $99.99. That's a twenty-dollar increase, and I was never notified about any price change.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Mr. Torres. Let me take a look at what's going on here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history, and it looks like your promotional pricing expired.

Customer: Promotional pricing? I've had this service for like... three years now. I didn't think that was promotional. I thought that was just my rate.

Agent: I completely understand why you'd feel that way. So what happened is when you first signed up three years ago, you were enrolled in a promotional rate of $79.99 for the first twelve months. That promotional period has since ended, which is why you're seeing the increase to our standard rate of $99.99 per month.

Customer: Well, that's... okay, but shouldn't you guys have sent me something about that? Like a notice or... I mean, I've been a customer for three years. Shouldn't that count for something?

Agent: You know, that's a really fair point. And I apologize that you didn't receive a notification. Let me see what I can do here for you. (pause) I'm going to be honest with you—I can't retroactively go back and change the charge on this month's bill because the service has already been provided. However, what I can do is I can apply a one-time courtesy credit of $20 to your account to cover this month's increase.

Customer: So you're putting me back to $79.99?

Agent: For this month, yes. But I do want to be upfront with you—going forward, your rate will be $99.99 per month unless we can find you another promotion or plan option. But let me check what we have available for loyal customers like yourself. (typing sounds) Are you interested in potentially bundling services? Do you have cable or phone services with us?

Customer: No, it's just the internet.

Agent: Okay, and are you currently locked into a contract?

Customer: I don't think so? I mean, I don't think I am. I've just been month-to-month for a while now.

Agent: Great, that's actually helpful. So here's what I can offer you. We have a loyalty promotion where I can put you on our Fiber 300 plan at $84.99 per month for the next twelve months. That's still lower than the standard rate, and it's only five dollars more than what you were paying. After that twelve months, the rate would go back to standard pricing, but at least you'd have a year to... (trailing off)

Customer: So it's just going to go up again in a year?

Agent: Potentially, yes. Unless promotional pricing is available at that time. I know it's frustrating. The telecommunications industry changes rates pretty frequently based on market demand and cost structures, but I want to make sure I'm giving you the most honest picture I can.

Customer: (pause) Okay, well, I mean... $84.99 is better than $99.99, so... can you just do that? Put me on that plan?

Agent: Absolutely. I can set that up for you right now. I'll go ahead and apply the $20 courtesy credit to your current bill, and then I'll enroll you in the twelve-month promotion at $84.99 per month. The change will take effect on your next billing cycle, which would be... (typing sounds) ...next month on the 15th.

Customer: Okay, that works. Thank you.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: My pleasure. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer for the past three years. We really do appreciate your business. You should see the credit reflected on your account within 24 hours, and you'll receive a confirmation email about the new promotion. If you have any questions, feel free to call us back. Is there a good number to reach you at?

Customer: Yeah, it's the same number on the account—555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, Mr. Torres. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
