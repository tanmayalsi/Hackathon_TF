Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um... I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and there's a charge on here that shouldn't be there.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment... Alright, I've got your account here. It's under the name Jennifer Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned there's a charge you'd like to dispute. Can you tell me a little more about what you're seeing?

Customer: Well, I've been with Frontier for... gosh, I think about three years now? And my bill has always been the same—$79.99 a month. But this month it jumped up to $109.99. That's a $30 increase! I didn't authorize that, and I want to know why.

Agent: I understand your concern, Ms. Martinez. That would definitely catch my attention too. Let me take a look at your account details here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate has expired. You had an introductory rate of $79.99 for the first 24 months, and that ended with your billing cycle that started on the 15th of this month.

Customer: Wait, what? Promotional rate? Nobody told me about any promotional rate. When I signed up, the representative said it was $79.99 a month. That's what I've been paying.

Agent: I completely understand the frustration there. Let me pull up your account notes... (typing sounds) Okay, so according to our records, the promotional terms were explained at the time of signup. However, I do see that there may not have been a courtesy notice sent prior to the rate change. That's something we typically try to do.

Customer: No, I definitely didn't get any notice. And honestly, if I had known this was coming, I would've... I don't know, I would've done something about it. What am I supposed to do now? I can't just absorb a 37% rate increase.

Agent: That's a fair point. Let me see what options we have here. (pause) So, Ms. Martinez, what I can do is I can apply a one-time courtesy credit to your account for the overage this month—that would be $30. However, going forward, the standard rate for our fiber internet service in your area is $109.99 per month.

Customer: Just... just one month? That's it? I'm going to be paying that $109.99 from now on?

Agent: Well, let me check if we have any current promotions available for your address. (typing sounds) Do you happen to know if you have any competing internet providers in your area? That sometimes helps me determine what promotional offers we can extend.

Customer: I think there's cable internet, but... I mean, Frontier's been good, you know? The speeds are solid. I've had maybe one outage in three years. I just feel blindsided by this.

Agent: I hear you. And I appreciate your loyalty. Let me see what I can do. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so what I'm able to offer you is this: I can lock in a rate of $89.99 per month for the next 12 months if you'd like to stay with us. That's a reduction from the standard $109.99, though it would be $10 more than your promotional rate.

Customer: Hmm... (pause) So that's $89.99 for a year, and then what happens after that? Does it jump again?

Agent: After the 12-month period, it would go to the standard rate unless another promotion is available at that time. But if you'd like, I can make a note on your account that you'd like us to reach out before any rate changes take effect.

Customer: Okay... I guess that's better than nothing. But I'm still upset that I wasn't notified before the increase happened. And I feel like you all should've been more upfront about this when I signed up.

Agent: You know, that's valid feedback, and I really do apologize for the lack of communication on our end. Promotional terms can sometimes get buried in the fine print, and we should definitely do a better job of making sure customers are aware. I'm going to make a note here about your experience, and I'm also going to apply that $30 courtesy credit we discussed.

Customer: Okay... yeah, alright. So to confirm—I get the $30 credit this month, and then my rate is $89.99 starting next month for the next year?

Agent: That's correct. The $30 credit will show up on your next bill, and the new rate of $89.99 will be effective with your next billing cycle on the 15th of next month. You should see both of those reflected when you receive your statement.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. I just... I wish this had been handled better from the start.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you've had this experience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for at least trying to work with me on this.

Agent: You're welcome, Ms. Martinez. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business. If you have any other issues, please don't hesitate to give us a call back.

Customer: Will do. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day.
