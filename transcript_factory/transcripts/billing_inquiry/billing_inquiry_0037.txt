Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I don't know, something doesn't seem right. My internet bill went up like thirty dollars, and nobody told me about this.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about a charge increase. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my home phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing your account for... is this Sarah Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Sarah. So you mentioned your bill increased by about thirty dollars. When did you first notice this?

Customer: I got the bill yesterday, so this is the first I'm seeing it. My last bill was like... I want to say $89.99, and now it's showing $119.99. That's a huge jump. I've been a customer for almost three years now, and I haven't had any changes to my service. I'm still on the same internet plan.

Agent: (pause) I completely understand your frustration, Sarah. Let me look at your billing history here. (typing sounds) Okay, so looking back, I do see that your rate did increase on your most recent billing cycle. Let me find the details on why that happened.

Customer: Okay... like, I feel like you guys should have sent me a notice or something before charging me more money. Did I miss an email? I don't remember getting anything about a price increase.

Agent: That's a really fair point. Let me check on that. (pause) So according to your account, you should have received an advance notice. It looks like it was mailed to you about thirty days before the change took effect. Did you happen to receive anything in the mail from us around... let me see... about a month ago?

Customer: (pause) You know, I'm not sure. I get a lot of mail. I might have missed it. But still, this seems like a really big increase for no reason. What changed? My speeds are the same, right?

Agent: Your speeds are the same, yes. So what we have here is a promotional rate expiration. You were on an introductory rate for the first... let me see here... for thirty-six months, and that promotional period ended with your last billing cycle. Your plan was the 500 megabit fiber internet service, and your promotional rate of $89.99 has now moved to the standard rate of $119.99.

Customer: (frustrated) Okay, so basically you guys charged me a promotional rate for three years just to hook me in, and now that I'm locked in, you're raising the price?

Agent: I understand how that feels, Sarah, and I hear your frustration. To clarify though, the promotional period was clearly outlined in your service agreement from when you originally signed up. However, I completely understand that three years later, it can feel sudden. The good news is that I do have some options that might help.

Customer: Okay... like what?

Agent: Well, first, I can check if there are any current promotions or loyalty offers available for you. Since you've been such a great customer for three years without any service issues, we might be able to apply a retention credit or get you on a new promotional rate. Let me check the system here. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I am seeing that we do have a current offer available. I could actually put you on a twelve-month promotional rate of $99.99 per month for the same 500 megabit service.

Customer: So that's still ten dollars more than what I was paying, but it's better than the thirty dollar jump.

Agent: Right, so you'd save twenty dollars a month compared to the standard rate, and it would give you a year to consider whether you want to keep the service or explore other options. And after that year, we could look at your account again and see what options might be available at that time.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. So I'm looking at this bill that's already been charged though. What happens with this current bill?

Agent: That's a great question. I can apply a one-time billing adjustment of $20 to your account for this current cycle as a goodwill gesture, which would bring this month's charge down to $99.99. How does that sound?

Customer: Okay, that's... that's better. So I'd get the $20 credit on this bill, and then going forward, I'd be at $99.99?

Agent: Exactly right. So I'm going to go ahead and apply that promotional rate and the goodwill credit to your account right now. (typing sounds) Let me just confirm everything here... (pause) Okay, so the $20 credit has been applied to your current bill, bringing it to $99.99. And starting with your next billing cycle, your recurring rate will be $99.99 per month for the 500 megabit fiber service, and that rate will be locked in for the next twelve months.

Customer: And then after twelve months, what happens?

Agent: So after twelve months, your rate would revert to the standard rate of $119.99 unless there's a new promotion available at that time, or unless we work something else out. But we'll definitely reach out to you before that happens so there are no surprises.

Customer: Okay. And the $20 credit, when will that show up?

Agent: The credit will be applied immediately to your account, so you should see it reflected on your next bill or in your online account portal within the next 24 to 48 hours.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. Is there anything else I should know about?

Agent: I don't think so. Just to recap, your promotional rate is now $99.99 for the next twelve months, you have a $20 credit on your current bill, and we'll reach out to you around month eleven to discuss what options might be available when that promotion ends. You'll continue to receive your same 500 megabit fiber internet service with no changes to your speeds or service quality.

Customer: That sounds good. Thanks for working with me on this, Marcus.

Agent: Of course, Sarah. I really appreciate your business, and I'm sorry again about the confusion with the rate increase. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we appreciate you being a loyal customer. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
