Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I'm really frustrated with my bill. I've been a customer for, I dunno, like three years now? And my internet bill just went up like thirty dollars out of nowhere.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And just to confirm, is this the account under the name Michael Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. Give me just one second here... (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account. So I see that your service address is on Maple Street in Portland?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. Okay, so I can see your billing history here. Your bill was $79.99 per month, and as of your last billing cycle, it jumped to $109.99. Is that the increase you're referring to?

Customer: That's exactly it. Like, why would it go up that much? I didn't add any services or anything. I'm just using the same internet I've always been using. Did you guys change your pricing or something?

Agent: That's a great question, and I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. (pause) So, looking at your account notes here, I can see that you were on an introductory rate when you first signed up. That introductory offer was for twelve months, and it looks like that period ended on your last billing cycle.

Customer: Oh... (pause) So you're telling me you just... increased it automatically? No one called me or sent me a letter or anything?

Agent: I understand your concern. Typically, customers do receive a notice in the mail about thirty days before a rate change takes effect, but I definitely understand if that got missed or didn't arrive. That happens sometimes with mail. Let me see what options we might have available for you.

Customer: Okay, because this is really steep. Like, I can't justify paying that much more. What are my options? Do I have to pay this or...?

Agent: (typing sounds) Well, let me look at what we currently have available. We definitely don't want to lose you as a customer. Let me check what promotional rates I might be able to offer you right now...

(pause)

Okay, so here's what I'm seeing. We have a current promotion where I could get you back down to $89.99 per month for the next twelve months. That would be our 500 Mbps fiber package, which is actually an upgrade from what you currently have.

Customer: So $89.99? That's still ten dollars more than what I was paying before.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, that's the best rate I have in the system for your area right now. The introductory pricing you had before was, you know, it was really limited-time offer pricing. But $89.99 is definitely better than the $109.99, and you'd also be getting faster speeds.

Customer: (pause) How much faster are we talking?

Agent: Your current plan is 300 Mbps. This would bump you up to 500 Mbps. So you'd have significantly faster download and upload speeds. It's really noticeable if you're streaming or working from home.

Customer: I do work from home sometimes, actually. (pause) How long is this rate good for?

Agent: This promotion would lock you in for twelve months at $89.99, and then it would go back to the regular pricing after that, which I should be transparent with you—we'd want to discuss before that happens.

Customer: Yeah, because I feel like this happened before where I wasn't paying attention and [inaudible].

Agent: No, I totally get it. And that's something we should have communicated better the first time around. So if you'd like, I can make a note on your account for ninety days before the next rate change is set to expire, and someone from our team can proactively reach out to you to discuss your options.

Customer: Okay, that would be helpful. (pause) You know what, let's go with the $89.99 deal. But I want to make sure about this note thing.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to apply that promotion right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so that's being applied to your account. Your new rate of $89.99 will show on your next billing cycle. And I'm adding a note here that says "Proactive outreach required 90 days before promotional rate expiration." So our team will definitely reach out to you.

Customer: Great. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope, you're all set on my end. Just to recap—your new rate is $89.99 for the next twelve months with upgraded speeds of 500 Mbps. You'll see that reflected on your next bill. And we'll be in touch before that rate expires.

Customer: Alright, thank you for that. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course, I'm glad we could find a solution. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, Michael. We really appreciate your business, and we apologize again for the confusion with the rate change. You have a great day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
