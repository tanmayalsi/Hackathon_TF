Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Actually, two things. First, my bill went up like thirty dollars, and nobody told me about that. And second, there's a charge for something called "premium support" that I never signed up for.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account real quick so I can take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now... And what's the best name to have on file?

Customer: It's James Martinez.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, James. I've got you here. So you're saying your bill increased and there's a charge you're not familiar with. Let me look at your current plan first. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing you've been on our standard fiber plan at 79.99 a month. Is that what you've been paying?

Customer: Yeah, that's what I've been paying for like... I don't know, two years maybe?

Agent: Right, so I'm looking at your most recent bill, and I see the rate did increase to 109.99. And I do see the premium support charge for 9.99 a month. Let me explain what happened here. It looks like your promotional rate expired. You were on a two-year promotional period, and that ended last month. So your rate went back to our standard pricing.

Customer: Okay, but nobody called me or sent me a letter or anything. This is the first I'm hearing about it.

Agent: I apologize for that. Typically, we do send out notifications about rate changes, but I understand that can sometimes get lost. As for the premium support, did you... do you remember having any conversations with a representative about adding that? Sometimes it can get added during a service call or—

Customer: No. Absolutely not. I never asked for that. I don't even know what premium support is.

Agent: (pause) Understood. So premium support is basically a service that provides you with priority technical support and faster response times. But if you didn't authorize it, that shouldn't be on your account. Let me go ahead and remove that for you right now.

Customer: Thank you. But I'm still upset about the rate increase. I mean, that's a thirty-dollar jump. That's huge.

Agent: I completely get it, James. That is a significant increase. Let me see what options I can find for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so we do have a promotion running right now for existing customers. I can put you on a discounted rate for another twelve months. That would bring your monthly bill down to 89.99 instead of the 109.99.

Customer: So that's still twenty dollars more than what I was paying before.

Agent: Yes, so it would be ten dollars more than your original promotional rate. I know that's still an increase, but it does help offset some of that jump. The reason is that the standard pricing has gone up due to infrastructure improvements we've made in your area, and the newer pricing reflects that.

Customer: (sighs) I don't know... Is there anything else you can do? Can I get a different plan or something?

Agent: That's a fair question. Let me pull up what other options are available to you. (pause, typing sounds) So we have our basic fiber plan at 59.99, but that's a slower speed—150 megabits instead of the 500 you currently get. Then we have the plus plan at 99.99, which is the same speed you have now, 500 meg.

Customer: So the plus plan is 99.99?

Agent: Yes, that's right. And that would be with the same promotional discount I mentioned, so it would actually be a bit less than what I quoted you for your current plan. Let me be honest with you though—from a value perspective, you're getting a really good deal with the current plan at 89.99 for those speeds.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so if I do the 89.99, how long is that rate locked in for?

Agent: That would be for twelve months, and then it would go back to the standard rate after that. But typically, we do offer promotions when rates are about to adjust, so you'd have options at that time too.

Customer: Alright. Can you credit my account for that premium support charge that was added without my permission?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm actually removing the premium support charge entirely, and I'm going to credit you back one month of that fee—so 9.99 should appear as a credit on your next bill. And I'm going to go ahead and apply that twelve-month promotional rate of 89.99 for you, effective immediately.

Customer: Okay, good. Thank you.

Agent: (typing sounds) And just to make sure there are no other surprises, I'm going to add a note to your account that you do not want any additional services added without your explicit verbal consent. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. I'm sorry for the frustration with the bill. We really do appreciate your business. Is there anything about your service itself—the internet speed or anything—that's been giving you any issues?

Customer: No, the service has been fine. The speed is good, no complaints there.

Agent: Great to hear. Well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications. You should see those changes reflected on your next bill. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
