# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm... I'm pretty upset about it, to be honest. My bill went up like forty dollars from last month, and I have no idea why.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I completely understand how frustrating that can be. Let me pull up your account here and take a look. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. The phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it here. And can I verify the name on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's David Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account now. So I can see last month you were at $89.99, and this month it's showing $129.95. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm seeing. I don't... I didn't authorize any changes to my service or anything. I've had the same plan for like two years. I just want to know what happened.

Agent: Okay, totally fair question. Let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) So I'm checking your account history, and it looks like... yes, so this is actually related to a promotional period ending. You were on an introductory rate for 12 months, and that promotional pricing just expired at the end of last billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about this. I mean, I read the fine print when I signed up, but it was literally two years ago. I didn't get any kind of notice that it was expiring or anything.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize that you didn't receive a notice. Let me just double-check our records here... (typing sounds) It looks like you should have received a notice via email about 30 days before the expiration. Did you happen to see anything in your email?

Customer: I... I don't think so? I mean, I get a lot of emails. But honestly, that's not really the point. The point is I'm now paying forty dollars more a month for the exact same service. That's... that's not right.

Agent: No, I hear you, and I completely understand your frustration. This is actually something I can help with. Let me see what options we have available for you. (pause, typing sounds) Are you still interested in keeping your service with us?

Customer: Well, yeah, I mean... I like your service. The internet has been really reliable. But at this price point, I'm going to have to look at what else is out there, you know?

Agent: I totally get that. Let me see... you're currently on our Gigabit Pro plan, is that right?

Customer: I think so? I have the 500 megabit plan, I believe.

Agent: Okay, so that would be our Gigabit Tier 1. So here's what I can do for you. I have a special retention rate that I can offer, which would bring your monthly bill back down to $99.99. That would be for a 12-month commitment.

Customer: So it's still going to go up by ten dollars from what I was paying before?

Agent: Right, so the promotional rate you were on was $89.99, and this would be $99.99. So yes, there would be a ten dollar increase, but that's significantly better than the $129.95 you're seeing now. And this rate is locked in for 12 months, so you won't see another increase during that time.

Customer: (pause) I don't know... that still feels like you're basically punishing me for being a loyal customer. I mean, I've been with you guys for two years without any issues.

Agent: I completely understand how that feels, and I appreciate your loyalty. Let me see if there's anything else I can do. (typing sounds) Hold on just one second... (pause) Okay, so I'm actually able to apply a one-time account credit of $40 to your current bill to make up for the first month of the increase. So you'd pay $89.95 this month, which essentially gives you another month at the promotional rate, and then the $99.99 rate would kick in after that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, well... that's better. I mean, that's something at least. So I'd get the $40 credit this month, and then starting next month it would be $99.99?

Agent: Exactly right. And again, that $99.99 is locked in for 12 months, so no surprises after that.

Customer: And you said it's for a 12-month commitment? What if I need to cancel before that?

Agent: If you cancel before the 12 months is up, there would be an early termination fee of $150. But honestly, at $99.99 per month, I think you'll be pretty happy with the rate and the service.

Customer: (pause) Alright, yeah, I mean... I'm not thrilled about the whole situation, but I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's do it.

Agent: Great, I'm really glad I could help. Let me just get this set up for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm applying the $40 credit to your account right now. That should process within 24 hours and show up on your next statement. Your new rate of $99.99 will begin on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay. And I'll get something in writing about this, right? Like an email confirmation?

Agent: Absolutely. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour or so detailing the $40 credit and the new rate with the 12-month commitment terms.

Customer: Alright, that sounds good.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you for... well, for actually trying to work with me.

Agent: My pleasure, and again, I really appreciate your business. If you have any issues with your service or any other questions, please don't hesitate to give us a call. Is there a preferred phone number for you?

Customer: No, the one on file is fine.

Agent: Great. Well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, David, and have a great day.

Customer: You too. Thanks again.

Agent: Bye now.
