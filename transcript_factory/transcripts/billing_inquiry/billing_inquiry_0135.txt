Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I need to talk to someone about my bill because I was just charged like fifty dollars more than usual and I have no idea why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing a billing concern. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm seeing the account for Sarah Chen at 2841 Maple Drive, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned there's a fifty-dollar increase. When did you first notice this? Was it on your most recent bill?

Customer: It came in yesterday. My bill is usually like $79.99 a month for the gigabit fiber plan, and this time it was $129.99. I've been a customer for like... three years? And I've never had an increase like that. What changed?

Agent: (pause) I completely understand your frustration. Let me take a look at your account details here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing that your promotional pricing period did expire... 

Customer: Promotional pricing? I didn't think I was on a promotion. I thought that was just my regular rate.

Agent: I can see how that would be confusing. Looking at your account, you were enrolled in a new customer promotion when you first signed up in 2021, which gave you the $79.99 rate for the first 24 months. After that promotion ended about... (typing sounds) ...about three months ago, your rate adjusted to the standard rate of $129.99 for the gigabit fiber service.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me you charged me this higher rate for three months and I'm just now seeing the bill? That doesn't make sense.

Agent: That's a great question. Let me check your billing history. (pause, typing sounds) I'm showing that your rate actually increased starting in July. Did you... did you not receive bills for June, July, and August?

Customer: No, I... I mean, I get them electronically. I just... I haven't really looked at them carefully. I just pay the bill. So wait, this has been going on for three months?

Agent: It appears so, yes. I apologize that this wasn't clearer to you. We typically send notifications when promotional rates are about to expire. Do you remember receiving any communication about this rate change?

Customer: (sighs) I mean, maybe? I get a lot of emails. But nobody called me or anything. And when I set up the account, nobody explained that it was temporary. Like, they made it sound like that was just my rate.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, I'm not able to reverse the charges from the previous three months, but what I can do is escalate this to our customer retention team. They may be able to offer you some options—potentially a new promotional rate or a loyalty credit. Would you like me to transfer you to them?

Customer: How long is that going to take? I don't want to be on hold forever.

Agent: It should only be a few minutes. They handle these situations regularly, and they have more authority to discuss options with you that I don't have access to. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yeah, I guess so. But I'm not happy about this. I mean, I've been a good customer. I've never missed a payment.

Agent: I completely understand, and I really appreciate your business over the past three years. Let me get you transferred over right now. Just one moment. (brief hold music) And Sarah, while I transfer you, your case number is 7849521 in case you need to reference this call.

Customer: Okay, got it. 7849521.

Agent: Perfect. Transferring you now to retention. Thank you for your patience.

Customer: Thanks.

(brief transfer tones)

Agent 2: Hi Sarah, this is Michelle from our retention team. Derek filled me in on your account. I see you received a rate increase from your promotional pricing expiring. I'm really sorry you didn't realize the promotion had an end date. Let's see what we can do for you.

Customer: Okay, so what are my options?

Agent 2: So typically when a promotion expires, I can offer you one of three things. The first option is I can credit back three months of the difference. That would be around $150 back to your account as a courtesy.

Customer: Okay, that's... that's something, I guess.

Agent 2: The second option is I can enroll you in a new promotion where your rate goes back down to $84.99 for the next 12 months, and then it would return to the standard rate. And the third option is we could look at downgrading your service. I see you have the gigabit fiber plan. We do have 400 meg service available at $89.99.

Customer: Hmm. So if I do the second option, after 12 months it goes back up to $129.99?

Agent 2: That's correct, yes.

Customer: (pause) That's kind of frustrating because I'd just go through this again. Can I do the credit and the new promotion?

Agent 2: (pause) Let me check... I can actually apply the $150 credit, and I can put you on the 12-month promotional rate of $84.99. How does that sound?

Customer: That's better. Yeah, I'll take that.

Agent 2: Excellent. I'm going to go ahead and apply both of those now. (typing sounds) Okay, the $150 credit has been applied to your account. You should see that on your next bill. And your new rate of $84.99 will be effective immediately starting on your next billing cycle, which is... (typing sounds) ...October 15th.

Customer: Alright. And you're going to send me a notification or something before it changes again in a year, right?

Agent 2: Absolutely. We'll send you an email notification at least 30 days before your promotional period ends so you're not caught off guard again. I promise.

Customer: Okay. That's good. I appreciate that, Michelle.

Agent 2: You're very welcome, Sarah. I really do apologize for the confusion. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thank you.

Agent 2: Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and for your patience today. You have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent 2: Bye, Sarah.
