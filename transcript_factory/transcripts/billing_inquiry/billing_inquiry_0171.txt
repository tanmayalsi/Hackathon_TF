Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Actually, two things—I want to know what this new fee is, and also my internet bill went up like thirty dollars. That's not right.

Agent: I'm sorry you're experiencing some billing concerns. I'd be happy to help clarify those for you. Let me pull up your account. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the number we use for the internet.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Sarah Mitchell.

Agent: (pause) Okay, Sarah, I'm showing your account here. I can see your most recent bill. Walk me through what you're seeing—what charges are you questioning?

Customer: Well, first of all, my bill was like $79.99 last month, and now it's $109.99. That's almost thirty bucks more. And then there's a line item that says... uh... "Equipment Maintenance Fee" for like $12.99. I don't remember signing up for that.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me break this down for you. (typing sounds) So looking at your account, I can see that you're on our Gig Fiber 500 plan. That's been your plan for about eight months now, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Okay. So what happened is your promotional pricing period ended. You were on an introductory rate when you first signed up, and that was locked in for the first twelve months. We're now nine months into your service, so your promotional period is ending in about three months, and the bill is adjusting. The new rate is $99.99 for the Gig Fiber 500 plan going forward.

Customer: Wait, so you're just... raising my price without asking me? I wasn't told about this.

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. The terms of the promotional pricing were outlined in your original service agreement, and we typically send notifications as customers approach the end of their promotional period. Did you receive any communications from us about this?

Customer: (pause) I mean... maybe? I get a lot of emails. But nobody called or anything. This is pretty sneaky if you ask me.

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate your feedback. We do try to communicate these changes clearly. But let me see what I can do for you here. (typing sounds) Looking at your account history, you've been a great customer—no late payments, solid service record. Let me check what retention options I might have available.

Customer: Okay, so... what about that equipment maintenance thing? The $12.99?

Agent: Yes, so that's actually separate. Let me explain that. That fee is for our advanced network support and equipment protection plan. It covers things like equipment failures, 24/7 technical support priority, and expedited replacements if your modem or router fails.

Customer: But I didn't add that. I have a router already. Why would I need that?

Agent: (pause) That's a good question. Let me look at when that was added to your account... (typing sounds) It looks like this was added about six weeks ago. Do you remember having any conversations with our team around that time? Sometimes it gets added during service calls or technical support interactions.

Customer: I... there was something about a month and a half ago. A technician came out because we were having some connection issues. He might have mentioned something about it, but I definitely didn't say yes to adding it as a regular charge.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, sometimes there's miscommunication in those situations. But here's what I can do—I can remove that equipment maintenance fee for you right now, effective immediately. That'll bring your bill down by $12.99. As for the rate increase, since you're in good standing and have been a loyal customer, I can extend your promotional pricing for another six months at the $79.99 rate. After that, you'd move to the regular rate, but at least you'd have that time to reconsider whether the service is still meeting your needs.

Customer: (pause) Really? You can do that?

Agent: Yes, I can. I have the ability to make those adjustments for valued customers, and as I said, you've been great to have on the network. So if you'd like, I can remove the equipment maintenance fee today and lock in your current promotional rate for another six months. After that, it would be $99.99 per month.

Customer: Okay, yeah. I mean... that's better. At least I'm not getting hit with a surprise price jump right now. But what happens after six months? Will I get a heads up next time?

Agent: Absolutely. When you're approaching the end of this new promotional period—so in about five and a half months—we'll send you notifications via email and mail. And honestly, at that point, you could always call us back to see what other options are available. Sometimes we have other promotions running, or you might be eligible for a different plan that could save you money.

Customer: Alright. And you're removing that equipment fee?

Agent: Yes, that's being removed effective immediately. You won't see that on your next bill. (typing sounds) And I've locked in the $79.99 rate for six more months. Your next bill should reflect both of those changes. You'll see it in about two weeks when it generates.

Customer: Okay, that's good. I appreciate that. Sorry for being short earlier—I was just frustrated when I saw that bill.

Agent: No, I completely understand. If I saw my bill jump like that, I'd be calling too. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thank you for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and if you have any other questions down the road, you know how to reach us.

Customer: Alright, have a good one.

Agent: You too. Have a great day!
