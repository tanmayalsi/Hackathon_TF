Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that shouldn't be there. Or actually, I'm not even sure what's going on. My bill went up like thirty bucks and nobody told me about it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing an issue with your bill. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up for you. One moment... (pause) Alright, I've got your account here. I'm showing a Derek Paulson in the area. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your bill increased by about thirty dollars. When did you last review your bill before this one?

Customer: I don't know, maybe a month or two ago? I usually just pay it without looking too closely, but this time I actually opened the email and was like... wait, that's way more than usual. I've been paying like $89 a month for the last couple years, and now it's saying $119. That's a huge jump.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Let me take a look at your billing history here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that your service was on our promotional rate. That promotion actually expired at the end of last month. Your bill increased because you've transitioned to our standard rate for Frontier Fiber 500 service.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me my promotion was ending. That's... I mean, I would've gotten a notice about that, right?

Agent: You should have received notice. Let me check the account notes here... (pause) I'm seeing that a notification was sent via email on... it looks like September 15th. Do you recall receiving something around that time?

Customer: (pause) Well, I get like a hundred emails a day. I might not have seen it. But still, shouldn't you guys have called or something? I've been a customer for years.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. You're right that we should have been more proactive with that communication. The promotional rate you had was $79.99 for the first 12 months, and after that period ended, you moved to our standard pricing of $119.99 for the same service level.

Customer: Okay, so... is that just how it works? The price goes up and I'm stuck with it?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me see what options we have available for you. (typing sounds) What I can do is explore some current promotions we're running. We do have a loyalty rate I might be able to apply to your account since you've been with us for quite some time. Can you hold for just one moment while I check with my supervisor on what we can offer?

Customer: Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I spoke with my supervisor and I have some good news. Because you've been a loyal customer and given the communication gap, I can offer you a rate of $99.99 for the next 12 months. That would bring your bill down from the $119.99 you're seeing now.

Customer: So I'd go from $89 to $99? That's still like a ten-dollar increase from what I was paying before.

Agent: I understand. Yes, there would still be a ten-dollar increase from your promotional rate. Unfortunately, the promotional period has ended, so we can't go back to that exact price. However, the $99.99 rate would be a significant savings compared to the standard $119.99, and it represents our best loyalty offer at this time. After the 12 months, that rate would adjust to standard pricing again.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. And if I don't take this offer, I'm stuck paying $119?

Agent: Correct. That would be the standard rate going forward.

Customer: Well... I guess ten bucks more is better than thirty. But I'm not happy about this. And honestly, you guys should've done better with notifying me. What happens in a year when this expires?

Agent: That's fair feedback, and I apologize again for the communication gap. In a year, we can absolutely review options with you before that rate adjusts. You'd be welcome to call in and we can look at what promotions we have available at that time. The key is to reach out before the expiration so we can work something out proactively.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, alright. Can you go ahead and apply that $99.99 rate?

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely. I'm applying that now to your account effective immediately. (pause) And just to confirm, this locks in your rate at $99.99 for the next 12 months starting this billing cycle. You should see the adjustment on your next bill.

Customer: Okay. Thanks. I mean, I'm still not thrilled, but at least it's something.

Agent: I really do appreciate your patience and understanding. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and thank you for being a loyal customer. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
