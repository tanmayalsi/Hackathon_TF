Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. My bill went up like thirty dollars out of nowhere, and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking here... and I see your account under the name... is this Patricia Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your bill increased by about thirty dollars? Let me take a look at what's changed here. (pause) I see here that on your last billing cycle, you were charged for an equipment rental fee of $14.99, and then there's also a... it looks like a price adjustment on your fiber service plan of $15.00. Is that what you're seeing?

Customer: Wait, an equipment rental? I didn't rent any new equipment. I've had the same router for like two years. And a price adjustment? Nobody told me about any price adjustment.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Patricia. Let me look into both of those for you. (typing sounds) So regarding the equipment rental—do you currently have a Frontier-provided modem and router combo unit, or are you using your own equipment?

Customer: I have... I think it's a modem and router together? It's a white box. Honestly, I don't even know if it's Frontier's or mine at this point. When I signed up two years ago, I think they just sent it to me.

Agent: Okay, so that's likely our equipment. The $14.99 would be the monthly rental fee for that. It's possible that fee wasn't showing up before, or there may have been a promotional credit that expired. Do you happen to remember getting any promotional offer when you first signed up?

Customer: Oh, um... yeah, actually, I think there was something about the first year being free or discounted or something. Is that... is that what expired?

Agent: That could very well be it. (pause) And then regarding the $15 price adjustment—let me see here. It looks like your introductory rate for your Fiber 300 plan ended. Your rate is going from $59.99 to $74.99 per month going forward.

Customer: That's... that's a huge increase. Why would they do that? Nobody called me or sent me a letter or anything. I just got surprised with this bill.

Agent: I can definitely understand why you'd be upset about that. We do typically send out notifications before a promotional period ends, but let me check your account notes here. (typing sounds) It looks like a notice was mailed to you about sixty days ago, but I completely understand if that got lost or overlooked—it happens all the time.

Customer: I mean, maybe? I don't know. But still, that's a lot more than I'm paying now. Can I just go back to my old price?

Agent: Unfortunately, the promotional pricing is only available for new customers during their first year of service. However, let me see what options I can explore for you here. (pause) I can absolutely put in a retention offer to see if we can adjust your rate. It might not be the exact same price, but I may be able to get you something better than the $74.99. Can you hold for just one moment while I check what promotions are currently available?

Customer: Yeah, okay, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Thank you for holding, Patricia. Great news—I can actually offer you a special promotional rate of $64.99 per month for your Fiber 300 plan if you're willing to sign up for another twelve months of service. That's $10 off the standard rate.

Customer: (pause) So that's still ten dollars more than what I'm paying now, but it's better than the seventy-five?

Agent: That's right. It would be $10 more than your current promotional rate, but $10 less than the regular rate. And it locks in that pricing for a full year, so you won't see any unexpected increases.

Customer: And what about this equipment rental fee? Can we do anything about that?

Agent: That's a great question. The rental fee is typically $14.99, but I can waive it for you for the next three months as a courtesy. After that, it would go back to the regular fee, but at least it gives you a little break while you adjust to the new rates.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I guess that's... that's better than nothing. So if I say yes to this, I'm locked in at $64.99, and then I get three months without the equipment fee. Then what—everything goes back up?

Agent: So what happens is, after three months, the equipment rental fee would resume at $14.99 per month. And then after twelve months from when we make these changes, the $64.99 rate would expire and it would go back to standard rates unless we reach out to you again with another offer. Does that sound reasonable?

Customer: I mean... I guess it has to be, right? (slight laugh) It's not ideal, but I don't really have a lot of options here.

Agent: I really do appreciate your understanding, Patricia. I know these rate changes can be frustrating. Before I make these changes to your account, is there anything else about your bill that I can address for you today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... maybe next time you guys could make these things a little clearer upfront instead of surprising people with huge bills?

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I hear you. That feedback is really valuable. Let me go ahead and get these changes processed for you right now. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm applying the promotional rate of $64.99, waiving the equipment fee for three months, and you're good to go for another twelve months. You should see these changes reflected on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there a phone number where we can reach you if we need to follow up on anything?

Customer: The number you already have should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. Well, Patricia, thank you so much for choosing Frontier Communications, and thank you for being a customer with us for two years. If you need anything else in the future, please don't hesitate to give us a call.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. Have a good day.

Agent: You too! Take care.
