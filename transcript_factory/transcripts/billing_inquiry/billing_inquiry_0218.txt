Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I've been a customer for like, three years, and my bill has never been this high.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. And just to confirm, can I get your name?

Customer: Yeah, it's James Mitchell.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, James. I'm pulling up your account now. (typing sounds continue) Alright, I've got you here. I'm seeing your current bill is $129.99. Is that the amount you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Last month it was like... ninety-something? I think it was around ninety-five dollars. So basically, I'm paying forty bucks more for the same service. That doesn't make sense.

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. Let me take a look at what changed here. (pause, typing) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate expired on the 15th of last month. You were on an introductory pricing of $89.99 for the first year, and that's now rolled over to our standard rate of $129.99 for the 500 Mbps fiber plan.

Customer: Wait, what? A promotional rate? I wasn't told about that. Nobody told me my rate was going to jump like that. That's... that's crazy.

Agent: I completely understand your concern, and I apologize that this wasn't communicated better to you. When you first signed up, the promotional offer was for twelve months, and then it would move to the regular pricing. That should have been outlined in your service agreement.

Customer: (frustrated) Well, it wasn't outlined very well because I certainly didn't expect it. Look, I can get service from Charter for like, a hundred and ten bucks for twice the speed. Why would I stay with you?

Agent: That's a fair point, James, and I appreciate your loyalty over the past three years. (pause) Let me see what I can do for you here. I do have some options available. I can't restore the original promotional rate, but I can offer you a discounted rate for the next six months if you'd like. We could bring you down to $99.99 per month.

Customer: So for six months, and then what? It goes back up?

Agent: That's... yes, that would be correct. Unless we're able to work something out when that period ends, or if you'd like to renew your service agreement, there may be other promotional options available at that time.

Customer: (sighs) How much is that saving me?

Agent: (typing) Okay, so at the discounted rate of $99.99, over the next six months that would be $599.94 versus the regular rate of $779.94. So that's a savings of $180 over that period.

Customer: That's... I mean, it's something, but it's still not great. Can you do any better than that?

Agent: Let me check what other options I have available. (pause, typing sounds) I'm looking at a few different promotions we're running. I can also offer you our 300 Mbps plan at $79.99 per month for twelve months if you're interested in stepping down in speed. That would be a lower rate for a longer commitment.

Customer: No, no. I need the 500 Mbps. I've got multiple people streaming in my house. Dropping the speed isn't going to work for me.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I understand. So let's stick with the 500 Mbps plan. The best I can do is the $99.99 for six months that we discussed. And I can also apply a one-time credit of $35 to your account to help offset the increase. That would bring your next bill down to around $95.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay. Okay, I mean, that helps. But I want to be clear—I'm going to be shopping around. If my rate goes up like this again, I'm switching. I'm serious.

Agent: I completely understand, James, and that's fair. I appreciate your business, and I don't want to lose you. When that six-month promotional period is coming to an end, I'd recommend giving us a call at least a few weeks before, and we can discuss what options might be available to you at that time. Sometimes we have new promotions running, or we may be able to work something else out.

Customer: Yeah, alright. Will I get a notification about that? I don't want to just have my bill jump up again without warning.

Agent: That's a great question. You should receive a letter in the mail about 30 days before the rate change takes effect, but I'll also make a note on your account that you'd like to be contacted before that happens. Would a phone call or email be better for you?

Customer: Email is fine. I check that more often.

Agent: Perfect. I'll put that in here. (typing) And just to recap what we've done today—I've applied the $35 credit to your account, and I've set you up with the promotional rate of $99.99 per month for the next six months on your 500 Mbps fiber plan. That credit should show up on your next bill.

Customer: Okay. And that starts right away?

Agent: Yes, it should take effect with your next billing cycle. You should see both the promotional rate and the credit reflected on your bill by the beginning of next month at the latest.

Customer: Alright, Derek. I appreciate you working with me on this. I was pretty frustrated when I called in.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm glad I could help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
