# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my internet bill went up like thirty dollars. I've been with you guys for three years and this is ridiculous.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. My name is David Chen.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, David, I'm looking at your account now. So you mentioned a charge you don't recognize and also a price increase? Let's start with that. When did you first notice the change?

Customer: This month. My bill was normally around $79.99, and now it's showing $109.99. Plus there's like a $15 charge for something called "Premium Router Rental." I never agreed to that.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I see what's happening here. Let me explain both of these. First, regarding the price increase—you were on our promotional rate for internet service, and that promotion ended last month. Your 12-month promotional period has completed, so your rate has gone back to our standard pricing for the 500 Mbps fiber service.

Customer: What? I mean... nobody told me about that. Shouldn't someone have called me or sent me a notice or something?

Agent: That's a fair point. We do send notices, typically about 30 days before a promotion ends, but I understand it's easy to miss those. Let me see here... (typing sounds) It looks like the notice was sent via email on September 15th. Did you receive that?

Customer: I... I don't know. I get so many emails. But the point is, I never signed up for any price increase. I signed up for $79.99 and that should stay that way.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, that promotional rate was specifically for the first 12 months of service, so when that period ended, the rate does adjust to our standard pricing. However, I do want to help you out here. Let me look at what options we have available. (pause) Okay, so I can't guarantee the original promo rate, but I can see if we have any current promotions I can apply to your account.

Customer: Okay, well what about this router rental charge? I definitely didn't agree to that.

Agent: Right, so about that—when we upgraded our network infrastructure in your area back in July, our technician installed a new gateway router. This is actually our newer model that provides better coverage and faster speeds, especially for fiber. However, there is a monthly fee for that equipment if you're renting it from us. You have the option to either continue renting it, or you can purchase your own compatible router if you prefer.

Customer: So you're just... charging me for equipment I didn't ask for? How is that even allowed?

Agent: I understand the frustration. The technician should have explained the rental fee at the time of installation and given you options. Let me make a note on your account here about that. (typing sounds) So, moving forward, we have a few options. One, you can continue renting the gateway at $14.99 per month. Two, you can purchase your own compatible router. Or three, I can actually remove the gateway rental and we can go back to your older equipment if you prefer, though you might not get the same signal strength.

Customer: How much would it be to buy my own router?

Agent: For a compatible gateway router, you'd be looking at somewhere between $200 to $300 depending on the model. You'd own it outright, so after that initial purchase, there's no monthly rental fee.

Customer: (pause) That seems like a lot. So you're saying I either pay fifteen bucks a month or buy a router outright? Why can't I just get the old one back?

Agent: You can definitely go back to your old equipment, and I can arrange that for you. It would just mean potentially slower speeds in certain areas of your home, but it would eliminate this rental charge entirely.

Customer: What about the price increase though? Can you do anything about that?

Agent: Let me check our current promotions. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so we do have a 6-month promotional offer right now for returning customers. I could apply that to your account, which would bring your internet service down to $89.99 for the next six months. After that six-month period, it would go back to the standard rate of $109.99 unless another promotion becomes available.

Customer: So it's only for six months? That's not really helping me long-term.

Agent: I understand, and I wish I had a longer-term option for you. The six-month promotion is actually what I'm able to offer right now, and it does save you $20 a month during that period. Alternatively, if you wanted to look at bundling internet with TV or phone services, we do have some longer-term package deals that might be more cost-effective overall.

Customer: I don't really want to add more services. I just want my internet bill to go back to normal. I've been a good customer for three years.

Agent: And I really do appreciate your loyalty, David. Let me do this—I'm going to apply the six-month promotion, and I'm also going to credit your account $15 for the router rental charge this month as a gesture of good faith. That way, this month you'll see $94.99 instead of $109.99. And regarding the router, what would you like to do? Should I arrange to have the older equipment sent back?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Go ahead and do that. And apply the promotion. But I'm not happy about this long-term. Once that six months is up, I'm gonna look at other providers.

Agent: I completely understand, and I don't blame you for feeling that way. If your situation changes or if you want to revisit options before that promotion ends, please don't hesitate to call back. We'd be happy to work with you. Let me just confirm what we're doing: I'm applying the six-month promotion bringing your rate to $89.99, I'm crediting $15 for this month's router rental, and I'm initiating a request to have a technician remove the gateway and reinstall your original equipment within the next three to five business days.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Can I ask you something though? Why didn't anyone mention any of this to me before I was charged?

Agent: That's a very valid question, and honestly, we should have done a better job of proactively reaching out. I've made a note on your account about the email notification that was sent, and I do apologize that this came as a surprise to you. 

Customer: All right. Well, thank you for at least trying to help a little bit. When should I expect the technician?

Agent: You should see a window within the next three to five business days. We'll send you an email with the appointment details, and you can also manage that through your online account portal if you need to reschedule. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I hope this goes smoothly.

Agent: I hope so too, David. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and I'm sorry for the confusion with your bill this month. If you have any issues with the technician visit or anything else, feel free to reach out to us anytime.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, and have a great day.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
