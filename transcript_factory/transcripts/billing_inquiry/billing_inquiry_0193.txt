Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm seeing a charge that wasn't there before. My internet bill just jumped up like thirty dollars, and I don't know why that happened.

Agent: I understand your frustration. I'm sorry to hear you're seeing an unexpected increase. Let me pull up your account here and take a look. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get your name please?

Customer: It's David. David Chen.

Agent: Great, David. Thanks for that. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I can see your most recent bill is for $94.99. Is that the one you're looking at?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. Last month it was 64, 65 dollars maybe? And now it's almost 95. That's almost a 50% increase. I didn't agree to anything like that.

Agent: I completely understand why you'd be concerned about that. Let me look into what might have caused this. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that you currently have our Frontier Fiber 100 plan at $49.99 a month. That's been consistent. But I'm also noticing a promotional discount that expired on your account.

Customer: A promotional discount? What promotional discount? I've had this service for like... three years now.

Agent: (pause) Yes, it looks like you had a twelve-month promotional rate that was applied when you first signed up. That was offering you $15 off your monthly bill. That promotion ended last month, so that's where the $15 increase is coming from on your base service.

Customer: Okay, so that's... wait, that's 15. Where's the other 15 dollars going?

Agent: Good question. Let me see here. (typing sounds) Ah, I see there's also a new modem rental fee that's been added to your account. That's $12.99 a month.

Customer: A modem rental fee? I already own my modem. I bought one years ago. Why would I be renting a modem?

Agent: That's a great question, David. Let me check the notes on your account. (pause) I'm not seeing any specific reason documented for why that fee was added. It's possible it was applied during a billing system update, but I apologize—this should not have been done without your knowledge or consent.

Customer: Yeah, I mean... I'm definitely not paying for something I don't need. Can you just remove that?

Agent: Absolutely. I can definitely help you with that. Before I do though, can I ask—do you have your own modem, or are you currently using one that we provided?

Customer: I have my own. I bought a Netgear one back in... I don't know, 2021 maybe? And it's working fine. I don't know why you guys would be charging me for a rental.

Agent: Perfect. In that case, I'm going to remove that modem rental fee from your account effective immediately. That will bring your bill back down to $64.99 a month, which is just the service itself.

Customer: Okay, good. But what about the promotional discount? Can we do anything about that?

Agent: That's a fair question. The promotional period has ended, so that discount is no longer available under the original terms. However, let me see what I can do for you. (typing sounds) You know what, you've been a loyal customer for three years, and I appreciate your business. Let me check what current promotions we have available.

Customer: I mean, yeah, that would be great. I don't want to switch providers or anything, but I also can't just absorb a 30-dollar jump without getting something in return, you know?

Agent: I totally get it. (pause) Okay, so I'm able to offer you a new promotion. We have a current offer for returning promotional pricing of $44.99 a month on the Fiber 100 plan for the next six months. That would actually be $5 less than your original promotional rate. How does that sound?

Customer: For six months? What happens after that?

Agent: After six months, it would go back to the regular price of $49.99 a month. But at that point, we can always revisit your account again and see if there are other options available.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah. I mean, that's better than paying $64.99. So that would be... $44.99 plus tax, I'm assuming?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Plus tax. So with the modem fee removed and this new promotion applied, your bill will be significantly lower than what you're seeing this month. Much closer to what you were paying before.

Customer: Alright. Yeah, that works for me. Can you get that set up right now?

Agent: I can absolutely do that for you. (typing sounds) Just give me one second here... okay, so I've removed the modem rental fee, and I've applied the promotional rate. You should see these changes reflected on your next billing cycle. You'll get a new bill statement, probably in about five to seven days, showing the updated amount.

Customer: Great. And is there anything else I need to do, or is that it?

Agent: That's all set on my end. I do want to ask though—is there anything else I can help you with today? Any questions about your service or anything like that?

Customer: No, I think we're good. I appreciate you taking care of that.

Agent: You're very welcome, David. I'm sorry again for the confusion with those charges. If you notice anything else unusual on your account in the future, please don't hesitate to give us a call back. We're here to help.

Customer: Okay, will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
