# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, your prices keep going up and I'm getting pretty frustrated.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... hold on... (rustling sounds) it's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account right now. Just give me one second here... (pause) Alright, I've got you here. I see your account is under the name David, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize? Walk me through that for me.

Customer: Yeah, so my bill this month is $129.99, and last month it was like $99.99. That's a thirty dollar jump, Derek. I didn't authorize any upgrades or anything. I'm still getting the same internet speeds I've always had.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I see that. Let me take a look at what changed on your account. (brief pause) I'm actually seeing here that you were on a promotional rate that expired. You were on our introductory pricing for twelve months, and your promotion ended at the end of last billing cycle.

Customer: A promotional rate? I didn't even know I was on a promotional rate. I mean, I knew the price seemed pretty good, but nobody told me it was going to jump up like this. That's... I mean, that's kind of deceptive, don't you think?

Agent: I hear what you're saying, and I apologize for the confusion. Typically, when you sign up for an account, the promotional period and the regular rate after that should be disclosed, but I understand it can be overlooked. What I can do is... let me see what options I have here. (typing sounds) Are you open to discussing different plan options or any other services that might help offset the cost?

Customer: No, I don't want to add more services. I just want to pay a reasonable price for the internet I already have. I've been a customer for... I don't know, almost three years now? And I feel like loyal customers should get better rates, not punished with price increases.

Agent: That's a fair point, and we definitely value your loyalty. (pause) Let me check something. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at current promotions we have available. We do have a plan that's comparable to what you're on now, and I could potentially move you to a different plan with a new promotional rate of $89.99 a month for the next twelve months. That would actually be ten dollars less than what you were paying before.

Customer: Wait, so you're saying I could get it cheaper than the original promotional price?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. It would be $89.99 per month for the next twelve months, and then after that it would go to the regular rate. I want to be transparent with you—after that twelve-month period, it would increase, similar to what happened this time.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. Well, at least that's honest. But this is still frustrating. The regular rate seems really high for just internet service.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Can I ask what speed you're currently on?

Customer: I think it's the 500 megabit plan? Maybe? I'm not entirely sure to be honest.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, checking here... yes, you're on our 500 Mbps fiber plan. That's actually one of our best plans and it's really high-speed service. For comparison, a lot of providers don't even offer speeds that fast.

Customer: Yeah, I guess that's true. I mean, the internet works great, I'm not complaining about the service itself. It's just... you know, money's tight and these surprise price increases are rough.

Agent: I completely get it. So, would you like me to go ahead and apply that $89.99 promotional rate for you? That would take effect on your next billing cycle, and you'd save ten dollars a month compared to your current bill.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Yes, let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm putting that through now. Let me just confirm the details with you. You'll be moving to the 500 Mbps fiber plan at $89.99 per month. The promotion is valid for twelve months from today, and then the regular rate of $129.99 will apply after that. You'll receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all these details.

Customer: Okay, and is there anything else I should know? Like, will there be an early termination fee or anything if I decide to cancel?

Agent: Great question. No, there's no early termination fee on this plan. You're month-to-month, so you can cancel anytime without any penalties.

Customer: Alright, that's good. Thank you for that.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I appreciate you working with me on this, Derek. I know it's not really your fault that the rates went up.

Agent: I appreciate that, and I'm glad I could help make this right for you. We really do appreciate your business, and if you have any issues with your service or need anything in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here for you.

Customer: Thanks. Have a good one.

Agent: You too, David. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and thanks for being a loyal customer.
