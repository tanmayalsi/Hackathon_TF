Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm pretty upset. My bill just jumped up like thirty dollars and I don't know why. I haven't added any services or anything.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that, and I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account and take a look at what's going on. Can I get the phone number or account number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. I've got you here. (pause) So I'm looking at your account and I can see your bill this month is $129.99. Is that the bill you're concerned about?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. Last month it was like ninety-nine dollars, and now it's almost one-thirty. I didn't sign up for anything extra, so I'm really confused.

Agent: Okay, I hear you. Let me look at what might have caused that increase. (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm seeing that you had an introductory rate that expired. You were on our promotional pricing for twelve months, and that period ended last month, so your rate went back to the standard pricing for the Gig Fiber plan.

Customer: Wait, what? I was supposed to be grandfathered in or something. When I first signed up, the rep told me—I mean, I specifically asked about what happens after a year, and they said something about keeping the price... I don't know, but definitely not almost thirty dollars more.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for the confusion. Promotional rates do have an end date, and unfortunately after that period, the standard rate applies. However, let me see what options I have for you. (pause) When did you sign up for your service?

Customer: It was like... fourteen months ago? Maybe fifteen. It was right after you guys expanded into my neighborhood.

Agent: Okay, so it sounds like your twelve-month promo period ended, and starting this month you're on the standard rate. I completely understand why that would be frustrating, especially if there was any miscommunication when you first signed up. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) 

Customer: Can you just go back to the other price? Or like, at least meet me somewhere in between?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me look at what promotions or retention offers I have available to you right now. (pause, typing sounds) So Jennifer, I do have some good news. I can offer you a price reduction back to $109.99 a month for six months. That would bring your rate down from the $129.99. How does that sound?

Customer: Six months? And then what happens after six months? It goes back up again?

Agent: That's a fair question. After the six-month period, the rate would adjust back to the standard rate unless we can put another promotion on the account at that time. But six months from now, you'd be in a good position to either renew a promo or we could discuss other options depending on what's available.

Customer: (sighs) I mean... that's better than the thirty-dollar jump, but it's still frustrating, you know? I've been a good customer. I pay my bill on time. I don't have any issues with the service. You'd think that would count for something.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I really do appreciate your loyalty. That's exactly the kind of customer we value. And I want to be transparent with you—if I could lock in a lower rate permanently, I would, but our system doesn't allow me to do that. However, if you stay with us and we make sure you're aware of your promo end date next time, we can look at renewing something before it expires instead of after. Does that make sense?

Customer: I guess so. Yeah, okay. Let's do the six-month thing at $109.99. But can you like... put a note on my account or something so I get reminded before it expires?

Agent: Absolutely, I can do that. I'm going to put a note right now. (typing sounds) I'm flagging your account to send you a courtesy notice ninety days before your promotional rate expires. That way you'll have time to reach out and we can discuss your options before any changes happen.

Customer: Okay, thank you. That actually helps a lot. So when does this new rate take effect?

Agent: It'll be effective on your next billing cycle, which should be... (pause) December 15th. So you should see the $109.99 charge on your next bill. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Jennifer?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: It's my pleasure, and again, I'm sorry for the confusion on the front end. We really do appreciate your business, and if you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Take care, Jennifer. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
