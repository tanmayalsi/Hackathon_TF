Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my internet bill has gone up like crazy.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your charges. I'd be happy to help you sort that out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And what's the best phone number to verify with you?

Customer: It's the same number—555-0147.

Agent: Perfect, I have that. So I'm seeing an account for David Chen at... (pause) ...an address on Maple Street. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, David. Now you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize and also concerns about the price going up. Let me take a look at your most recent bill here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your statement from this month. Can you tell me which charge is standing out to you?

Customer: Well, first of all, my bill jumped from like $89.99 to $119.99. That's thirty dollars more a month. And then there's this... it says "equipment upgrade fee" for like $15. I never asked for any equipment upgrade.

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. So you're seeing two issues here. Let me address both of those. (pause) Okay, so looking at your account, it looks like back in March—that would have been about two months ago—there was a service plan adjustment. You were previously on our standard Gig fiber package, and it appears... hmm, let me see here... (typing sounds) it looks like there was an upgrade to our premium Gig package.

Customer: I didn't ask for that! I mean, nobody called me asking if I wanted to upgrade. That just happened on its own?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, David. Let me pull up the notes on your account to see... (pause) Okay, I'm not seeing an explicit note about a customer request for an upgrade, but it does look like the change went into effect on March 15th. Do you recall receiving any promotional communications around that time?

Customer: Hmm... there might have been something in the mail, but I definitely didn't call anyone and ask for an upgrade. And I certainly didn't authorize any $15 fee for equipment.

Agent: Right, and that equipment fee—I'm looking at that now. That appears to be for a modem refresh. Our system shows that your current modem is... (typing sounds) ...it's about four years old, so it would have been automatically flagged for a replacement to ensure optimal service speeds. But typically that's a complimentary service unless the customer had damage to the equipment or...

Customer: (interrupting) Wait, so Frontier just decided to send me new equipment and charge me for it without asking?

Agent: I can see how that would be frustrating. Let me explain what typically happens—when a modem reaches a certain age, we do automatically schedule replacements to keep our network running smoothly, but the fee shouldn't have been applied without authorization. (pause) You know what, let me look into this a little further. Did you actually receive new equipment?

Customer: No, I didn't receive anything. This is the first I'm hearing about it.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. So the charge is on there but no equipment was sent. Let me make a note of that. (typing sounds) Now, regarding the service plan change, I want to make sure we get this right. Can you tell me—are you actually noticing a difference in your internet speeds or service?

Customer: Not really, no. Everything seems pretty much the same as before.

Agent: Okay, so you're not seeing improved service, but you are paying $30 more per month. I can definitely understand why that would be concerning. Here's what I can do for you. First, I'm going to remove this $15 equipment fee entirely because you never received the equipment and you didn't authorize that. (typing sounds) Done. That's removed from your account effective immediately.

Customer: Okay, good.

Agent: Now, regarding the service plan upgrade to the premium package—I'm going to look into how that change was initiated. While I'm doing that, I want to offer you a couple of options. One option is, I can downgrade you back to the standard Gig package you were on before, which would bring your bill back down to $89.99. Or... (pause) ...if you'd like to keep the premium package, I can apply a promotional discount of $15 per month for the next twelve months, which would bring your bill down to $104.99. That's still higher than before, but it gives you a discount while you keep the improved service tier.

Customer: What's the difference between standard and premium again?

Agent: Great question. The standard Gig package provides up to 1-gigabit speeds with our standard WiFi router. The premium package provides the same speeds, but with a prioritized network connection during peak hours, and it includes our advanced WiFi 6 router, which gives you better coverage and faster speeds on your WiFi throughout your home.

Customer: Honestly, I live by myself in a small apartment. I don't think I need all that.

Agent: That makes sense, then. In that case, I'd recommend we just downgrade you back to the standard package. That way you're back to your original price, and we'll investigate how that upgrade happened in the first place. How does that sound?

Customer: Yeah, that works. And what about the $15 charge that's already on there? Will that get refunded?

Agent: Absolutely. I've already removed the charge from your account. You should see a credit applied within one to two billing cycles, or you can contact us and we can process it as an immediate credit to your account if you'd prefer.

Customer: An immediate credit would be better.

Agent: You got it. (typing sounds) Let me process that for you right now... (pause) Okay, I'm applying a $15 credit to your account right now. You should see that reflected on your next bill, or if you check your account online, it should show up within a few hours.

Customer: Great, I appreciate that.

Agent: And I'm going to go ahead and process this downgrade to the standard package as well. That'll take effect on your next billing cycle, so your next bill should reflect the $89.99 rate. (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm also going to add a note to your account about this situation so if you ever have questions about these changes, there's a record here explaining what happened.

Customer: Thank you. I appreciate you taking care of this.

Agent: Of course, David. I'm sorry you had this experience. We definitely want to make sure any changes to your account are authorized by you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and thank you for calling in. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
