Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. My bill went up like thirty dollars and... I mean, I've been a customer for three years and my rate has always been the same, so...

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now... and I'm seeing the account under the name Sarah Martinez, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. Let me just take a look at your recent billing here. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at your statement from December 15th. Can you tell me which charge is concerning you?

Customer: Well, the whole thing is concerning me, to be honest. My internet service was $79.99, which is what I've been paying. But then there's this line item that says "Service Rate Adjustment" for $29.95. What is that? I didn't authorize any changes to my account.

Agent: Ah, okay. Yeah, I see that charge right here. So that would be... (pause) let me just pull up some notes on your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so looking at this, it appears your promotional rate expired in November. You had been on an introductory rate for the first three years of service, and that promotion has now ended. The rate adjustment reflects our standard pricing for that service tier.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Nobody told me that my promotional rate was going to expire. I mean, if I'd known that, I would've... I don't know. That's not fair. Can you put me back on the promotional rate?

Agent: I completely hear you, Sarah. And I apologize that you weren't given more notice about that transition. (pause) Unfortunately, the introductory rate was a limited-time offer, so I'm not able to reinstate it once it's expired. However, let me see what options I might have available for you in terms of alternative pricing.

Customer: So what are you saying? I'm just stuck paying this new rate?

Agent: Well, let me check what current promotions we have available. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I do see that we have a promotional offer available right now. It's not the exact same rate you were on, but it would bring your monthly bill down to $89.99 for the next 12 months. That's still higher than your introductory rate, but it would eliminate that $29.95 adjustment charge and give you some savings.

Customer: $89.99? That's still ten dollars more than what I was paying.

Agent: Yes, I understand. The introductory rate of $79.99 was specifically limited to the first three years as an introductory offer. After that, our standard rates do go up. But this $89.99 promotional rate would be a significant reduction from the full rate of $109.94 that would apply without the promotion.

Customer: This is ridiculous. So you're telling me that you increased my rate without asking me, and now you're offering me a "promotion" that's still more expensive than what I was paying? And I've been a loyal customer for three years.

Agent: Sarah, I really do understand your frustration, and I appreciate your loyalty. (pause) Let me be honest with you—I don't have the ability to override the promotional terms or apply a custom rate to your account. However, what I can do is note this conversation and transfer you to our customer retention specialist. They sometimes have additional options or authority that I don't have access to. Would you like me to do that?

Customer: (hesitant) Well... yes. I mean, I don't know if it'll help, but at this point, what do I have to lose, right?

Agent: Absolutely. And I really do appreciate your patience with me. Before I transfer you over, let me just verify your preferred callback number.

Customer: It's the same number, 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, this shouldn't be a long wait. Our retention team is pretty responsive. I'm going to stay on the line with you while I transfer you over, so you shouldn't hear any weird hold music or anything like that. One moment please.

(pause, background noise of typing)

Agent: Okay, I'm connecting you now... and you should be speaking with Marcus in just a moment.

(brief hold tone)

Agent: Thanks for holding, Sarah. Marcus is going to take excellent care of you.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: You're very welcome. Have a great day.
