Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up quite a bit overall. I'm not happy about it.

Agent: I understand. I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's the number you just called me on, actually. 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street in Riverside?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great, I've got you here. So you mentioned your bill went up and there's a charge you don't recognize. Let me take a look at your current statement. (pause) Okay, so your bill this month is $127.49. Is that higher than what you were paying before?

Customer: Yeah, I was paying like $89.99 for the past... I don't know, couple years? And now it's jumping up to like $119 base, plus there's this extra $15 charge I've never seen before. What is that about?

Agent: Okay, I see what you're referring to. So you have two things going on here. First, let me address the price increase. You've been on our promotional rate for twenty-four months, and that promotion expired this month. Your service is now transitioning to our standard Gigabit Fiber rate, which is $119.99 a month. I apologize that we didn't notify you more clearly about this increase.

Customer: Well, that's... that's frustrating. Why would nobody tell me about this? I've been a customer for years.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. You should have received a notification about thirty days before your promotional period ended. Let me see if I can find a record of that. (pause) It looks like a notice was sent to your email on October 15th. Did you happen to receive that?

Customer: I... I don't check that email very often, honestly. But still, you could've called or sent something in the mail. Email isn't reliable.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that. That's fair feedback. Now, regarding the $15 charge—that's actually a modem rental fee. It looks like at some point your equipment was upgraded, and this fee wasn't previously applied to your account. Can I ask, did you recently receive any new equipment from us?

Customer: (hesitating) Um... maybe? There was a tech who came out about three months ago. He said something about upgrading my modem for better speeds or whatever. I didn't think I was going to be charged extra for that.

Agent: I see. So that equipment upgrade did trigger the modem rental fee. I should mention, though—we do offer the option to purchase the modem outright instead of renting it. The modem costs $199.99 as a one-time purchase, and then you'd eliminate that $15 monthly rental fee. Over time, that would save you money.

Customer: So wait, I have to pay for the modem either way?

Agent: Well, let me clarify. The modem is necessary equipment for your service. You can either rent it month-to-month for $15, or purchase it outright for $199.99. If you rent, you'll continue to pay that fee. If you purchase, you own it and won't have any rental charges going forward.

Customer: (frustrated) Okay, so I'm basically just... stuck paying for it either way. That doesn't seem right. I didn't ask for a new modem in the first place.

Agent: I understand your position. Let me see what I can do to help make this right. (pause, typing sounds) What I can do is this: I can waive the modem rental fee for your account for the next three months. That'll give you time to decide if you want to purchase the modem or continue renting. Additionally, because you were on that promotional rate and we could have done a better job notifying you about the increase, I can offer you a $20 credit to your account this month.

Customer: (pause) So the $20 credit would bring my bill down to...?

Agent: Your bill would go from $127.49 down to $107.49 this month. And then for the next three months, the $15 modem fee will be waived, so you'd be looking at approximately $119.99 per month. After that promotional period ends on the modem waiver, you'd either need to purchase the modem or the rental fee would resume.

Customer: Hmm. Okay, I guess that's... that's better than nothing. But I'm still not thrilled about the overall increase. Why is the base rate so much higher now?

Agent: That's a good question. Our Gigabit Fiber service is actually a premium product—you're getting speeds up to 1 gigabit per second, which is significantly faster than standard broadband. The pricing reflects that upgrade. Now, I will say, if you find it's more than you need, we do have other plans available at lower price points, like our 100 Mbps plan, which would be $59.99 a month. But you'd be stepping down from the gigabit speeds.

Customer: No, I... I actually need the fast internet for work. I work from home and I do video calls all day. So the gigabit plan is fine, it's just... you know, unexpected.

Agent: I completely understand. And again, I apologize for the lack of clear communication on our end about the rate change. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you on your bill today?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that's... I think we're okay. So just to make sure I have this right: I'm getting a $20 credit this month, the modem fee is waived for three months, and after that, I'll be paying $119.99 a month unless I buy the modem, which costs $199.99.

Agent: That's exactly right. You've got it. And just to remind you, if you do decide you want to purchase the modem, just give us a call back and we can set that up. It's a one-time charge and you'll own the equipment.

Customer: Okay. Alright, thanks. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course. I really do apologize again for the confusion. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and we hope you continue to enjoy your service. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
