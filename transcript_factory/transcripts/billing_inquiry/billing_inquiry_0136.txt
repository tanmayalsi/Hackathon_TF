Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that doesn't make any sense. I need to know what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my account number... well, actually, I'm not sure if that's the account number or my phone number. Let me grab the bill real quick.

Agent: (typing sounds) No problem, take your time.

Customer: Okay, so my account number is 4-8-2-7-9-1-5-3-2.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: Sarah Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. I've got you pulled up here. So what charge are you seeing that's concerning you?

Customer: Okay, so my bill last month was $79.99, which was already a little higher than what I was expecting, but I figured... I don't know, whatever. But this month it jumped to $109.99. That's a thirty dollar increase out of nowhere. I haven't added any services or anything. What is that about?

Agent: (pause) I understand, that is a significant increase. Let me take a look at what's happening on your account here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing you're on our standard Fiber 200 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's... that's what I've had for like two years now.

Agent: Right. So what I'm seeing is that you were enrolled in a promotional rate that expired. Your promotional pricing was $79.99 per month for the first 12 months, and that period ended with your last billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me I got a promotional rate and nobody told me it was going to jump up thirty dollars? That's... that's not fair. Why wouldn't someone have contacted me about that?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Sarah. You should have received a notice in your billing statements prior to the rate adjustment. Let me pull up your account notes here to see what we have documented.

Customer: I mean, I get a lot of mail, but I don't remember seeing anything about this. Couldn't you guys have called me or sent an email or something?

Agent: (pause) That's a fair point. Our typical notification process is through mail, but I can see how that might get missed. And looking at your account, I'm not seeing a note that indicates a courtesy call was made. The standard Fiber 200 plan is now $109.99 per month after the promotional period ends, so that's the rate that's been applied.

Customer: So what, that's just it? I'm stuck with it? I mean, I like your service, the internet is fast, but I can't just swallow a thirty dollar increase every month. That's almost four hundred dollars a year.

Agent: I hear you, and I really do appreciate your business over these past two years. What I can do is look at what other options are available to you. (typing sounds) We do have some retention offers that might be applicable here. Let me check if there's anything I can work with for you.

Customer: Okay, well... what kind of offers are we talking about?

Agent: (pause) Alright, so I'm looking at our current promotions. Unfortunately, you would not qualify for a brand new customer promotional rate. However, I do see that I could potentially offer you a loyalty rate on the Fiber 200 plan at $94.99 per month for the next 12 months. That would be a reduction from the $109.99 you're currently looking at.

Customer: So I'd go from $79.99 to $94.99? That's still a fifteen dollar increase from what I was paying.

Agent: It is, but it's significantly lower than the standard rate. The fifteen dollar increase is really just reflecting the difference between our introductory promotional pricing and our loyalty pricing. It's the best rate I can offer in your situation.

Customer: (sighs) Can I ask you something? What if I called and threatened to cancel? Would you give me a better rate?

Agent: (brief pause) Sarah, I appreciate the question. Honestly, the loyalty rate I'm offering is already one of my best options for you. If you were to cancel and reactivate, the earliest you'd be eligible for a new promotional rate would be after a period of time, and even then, those promotional rates change. You'd likely be paying more overall. The loyalty offer I'm presenting to you right now is really your best value.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) I mean... I guess that's better than $109.99. But I'm not happy about this. This feels like a bait-and-switch.

Agent: I understand it feels that way, and I'm sorry you're frustrated. I know price increases are never fun. What I can do is apply this loyalty rate to your account effective with your next billing cycle, and I'll also make sure to put a note on your account so that if this comes up again, we have documentation that we discussed this with you.

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, okay. Okay, do that. Apply the loyalty rate. But I'm gonna be honest, I'm definitely shopping around at this point. My neighbor has been telling me about some other providers in the area.

Agent: That's completely fair, and I totally understand. Just so you know, if you do have questions about your service in the future or if you want to revisit your plan, please don't hesitate to reach out. We value your business.

Customer: Yeah. Okay, so just to confirm, my new rate is $94.99 starting next month?

Agent: That's correct. You'll see it reflected on your next billing statement. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's everything. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, Sarah. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Yeah, bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
