Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like thirty dollars from last month and nobody told me about it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having billing concerns. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm getting that here... And just to confirm, is this for the service address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm looking at your account now. I can see your most recent bill here. Walk me through what you're seeing that concerns you?

Customer: Well, so my bill last month was like... I don't know, around $89 or so? And this month it's showing $119. That's almost thirty bucks more. And then there's this line item I've never seen before. It says "Service Plan Upgrade Fee" for like fifteen dollars. I never asked for any upgrade.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I see that. Let me take a look at what happened here. (typing sounds) So it looks like... oh, I see. Did you happen to contact us in the past thirty days about increasing your internet speed or anything like that?

Customer: No, absolutely not. I'm happy with my internet. Why would I pay more for something I didn't ask for?

Agent: No, you're right to question that. Let me investigate this because that shouldn't have been applied without your authorization. Can I put you on a brief hold while I look into your account history?

Customer: Yeah, okay. How long is this gonna take?

Agent: Shouldn't be more than two or three minutes.

Customer: Alright.

Agent: (hold music, then returns after approximately 90 seconds) Okay, I'm back. So I looked into this, and I found something. It looks like there was an automatic upgrade that was applied to your account on the 15th of last month. This can sometimes happen if there's a promotional offer that expires or... (pause) Actually, let me see here. Were you by any chance on a promotional rate?

Customer: I mean, maybe? When I signed up like two years ago, they said I had some kind of promotion going on. But nobody told me it was gonna end.

Agent: Right, that's exactly what happened here. So you were on a promotional pricing of $89.99 for your Fiber 100 plan, and that promotion expired on the 15th of last month. The system automatically moved you to our regular pricing, which is $104.99. And then separately, there was a... (typing sounds) ...actually, I'm seeing here that a technician visited your location on the 12th and documented that your modem was outdated and recommended an upgrade to our newer equipment, which would have been an additional fifteen dollars monthly.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about that. I wasn't even home on the 12th.

Agent: Let me see what notes are here... (pause) Okay, so it says the technician left a door hanger notification but didn't actually complete the installation or anything. It looks like this was just a recommendation. The system shouldn't have auto-applied that charge.

Customer: So you're telling me I'm getting charged for something I didn't even agree to?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and you're absolutely right. That's not how this should work. The equipment upgrade charge should not have been applied without your explicit consent. What I'm going to do is remove that fifteen-dollar upgrade fee from your account immediately. (typing sounds) Done. That's been removed.

Customer: Okay, well, what about the price increase? I mean, I get that the promotion ended, but nobody ever told me it was ending. Why don't you guys send out notifications or something?

Agent: That's actually a really fair point, and I apologize for that. We should have sent you a notification before the promotion expired. Typically it's in the fine print of your agreement, but I understand that's frustrating. Let me see what I can do here. (pause) So your promotional rate was set to expire, but given that you've been a good customer for two years and this situation wasn't handled as well as it should have been, I can extend a promotional rate for you.

Customer: Really? What kind of rate?

Agent: I can put you back on a promotional rate of $94.99 for the Fiber 100 plan for another year. That would be five dollars more than your previous promotional rate, but it's significantly less than the $104.99 standard rate. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) That's... yeah, okay, that's better. So that would be $94.99 plus taxes?

Agent: Yes, exactly. So with taxes, you're looking at roughly $103 or so depending on your area, but that's still going to be significantly less than the $119 you're seeing this month. And I'm going to remove that fifteen-dollar equipment charge that was applied in error.

Customer: Alright. So what's my bill going to be?

Agent: So for this month, because we're removing the $15 charge and applying the new rate retroactively, your adjusted bill should come to approximately $104 with tax. And then going forward, your monthly bill should be around $103 to $105 depending on any taxes or fees.

Customer: Okay, and this is for a year?

Agent: Yes, this promotional rate is good for 12 months from today. After that, it would revert to our standard pricing unless we have another promotion available at that time. But we can definitely discuss options when we get closer to that date.

Customer: And you're removing the fifteen-dollar thing?

Agent: Yes, that's already been taken care of. It's been removed from your account.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. Um, is there anything else I should know?

Agent: Well, the one thing I do want to mention—that technician who came by did recommend the newer modem equipment. It's not necessary, but if you're experiencing any slow speeds or connectivity issues, that newer equipment might help. But again, it's completely optional and won't be charged to you unless you specifically request it.

Customer: No, my internet's been fine. I don't need it.

Agent: Perfect. Then you're all set. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. I'm sorry again for the confusion on your bill. You should see an adjusted bill within the next few days, and the new rate will start on your next billing cycle. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
