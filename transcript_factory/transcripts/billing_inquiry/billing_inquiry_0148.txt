# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Or actually, I mean, I recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it and nobody told me about it.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account and see what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my home phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. One moment... Alright, I've got your account here. Your name is David Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great, David. And which charge are you concerned about? What's showing on your bill?

Customer: Okay, so my bill went from $89.99 to $119.99. That's a thirty dollar increase. I've been a customer for... I don't know, four years? Five years? And I've never had to pay that much. Nobody called me, nobody sent me a letter. It just... it just appeared.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me look into this for you. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your service plan was updated. It looks like you were on our Fiber 300 plan, and it was automatically upgraded to our Fiber 500 plan about... (typing) ...about two weeks ago.

Customer: An automatic upgrade? I didn't request that. Why would I be automatically upgraded without my permission?

Agent: That's a great question, and I appreciate you asking. Let me check the notes on your account to see if there was any communication about this. (pause) (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm looking through here and... it appears that when you were billing with us last month, there was a promotional period that ended. You were actually on a promotional rate of $89.99 for your Fiber 300 service, and that promotion expired.

Customer: But that doesn't explain the upgrade. I was fine with Fiber 300. I don't need 500.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion. What appears to have happened is that our system auto-enrolled you into the next tier when your promo ended. It shouldn't have done that without your explicit consent. That's actually... that's on us. I'm really sorry about that.

Customer: So what do I do? I don't want to pay $119.99 a month. I want to go back to what I was paying before.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so here's what I can do for you. First, I can definitely downgrade you back to Fiber 300, which will bring your monthly rate down. However, I do need to let you know that the promotional rate you were on has ended, so the rate won't be exactly $89.99 anymore.

Customer: How much would it be?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see... The regular rate for Fiber 300 is $109.99 per month.

Customer: (pause) Wait, so even the regular price is more than what I was paying?

Agent: I understand. Yes, we did adjust our pricing structure over the past year. But listen, what I want to do here is make this right. I can offer you a promotional rate. We have a current offer for Fiber 300 at $99.99 per month for the next twelve months. After that, it would revert to the regular rate of $109.99. How does that sound?

Customer: $99.99? That's still ten dollars more than what I was paying before.

Agent: I hear you. And I'm sorry about that. I know that's still an increase. But given what happened with the auto-upgrade, I want to see if there's something else I can do. Let me check if I can add anything to help offset that cost. (pause) (typing sounds) What if I waived your first month at the new rate? So you'd pay nothing for February, and then your rate would be $99.99 starting in March?

Customer: (long pause) I... I mean, I guess that's better than nothing. But I'm really upset about this. I've been loyal to Frontier for years. I never miss a payment. And then you guys just automatically upgrade me and charge me more without even letting me know?

Agent: You're right, and I'm genuinely sorry. That's not how we should treat our customers, especially someone who's been with us as long as you have. We shouldn't have auto-enrolled you without clear communication. I can note this on your account, and I'm going to make sure this doesn't happen again. I'm also going to credit that first month for you. Does that help?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Yeah, I appreciate that. Will I get a new bill or something showing the credit?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. You'll see the credit on your next bill, and then your new rate will start after that. I'm also going to put a note on your account flagging this so that you won't be automatically changed again without your permission. If there are any future promotions or changes, we'll contact you first.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I appreciate you taking care of this.

Agent: Of course, David. I'm sorry again for the frustration. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help, Marcus.

Agent: Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and for calling in today. We really do appreciate you. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
