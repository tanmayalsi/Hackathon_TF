Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm seeing a charge that I don't think should be there. My bill basically jumped up like forty dollars from last month, and I need to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your bill. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. One moment please... Alright, I've got your account. I'm seeing your service address is on Maple Street in Portland, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, I'm speaking with... the account holder's name?

Customer: This is Sarah Chen.

Agent: Great, Sarah. So you mentioned your bill increased about forty dollars. Let me take a look at your last couple of statements. (pause, typing) Okay, so I'm seeing last month you were charged $89.99, and this month it's showing $129.99. Is that... is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yes! Exactly. That's a forty dollar jump, and I haven't changed anything. I didn't add any premium channels or anything. I'm just getting the basic fiber internet package like I always have.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me look into what might have caused that. (pause) So I'm seeing here that your promotional rate expired. It looks like you were on an introductory rate for the first twelve months of service.

Customer: Wait, wait... a promotional rate? I mean, nobody told me that was going to happen.

Agent: I can see how that would be frustrating. Let me explain what I'm seeing here. When you signed up—looks like that was about a year ago—you were enrolled in our New Customer Promotion, which gave you internet service at $89.99 per month for the first year.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, so that was just... temporary?

Agent: Yes, it was a promotional rate that was set to expire after twelve months. So once you hit that one-year mark, you'd automatically move to our standard rate, which for your speed tier is $129.99 per month.

Customer: That's... I mean, I get that now, but that seems like something they should have reminded me about before just charging me the extra forty bucks. Like, a heads-up email or something?

Agent: (pause) You know what, Sarah, that's actually a really valid point. We should have sent you a notification before that rate change took effect. Let me make a note of that here. (typing) And let me see what options we have available to you.

Customer: Okay... I mean, are there any... I don't know, can I get a better rate? This is a pretty big jump for me.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) So, I'm looking at our current retention offers, and I do see that I can help you out here. We have a promotion available for existing customers where I can offer you twelve months at $99.99 per month for your service tier. That would be a savings of thirty dollars compared to the standard rate.

Customer: Thirty dollars? So that's still ten dollars more than what I was paying before.

Agent: I understand. So the promotional rate you had was really our best new customer offer. However, this retention rate at $99.99 would actually be about ten dollars less than our standard rate. It's not quite back to what you were paying, but it is a significant savings compared to where you'd be otherwise.

Customer: (long pause) Hmm. And that would be for twelve months?

Agent: Yes, twelve months. And then after that, it would go back to the standard rate unless we have another promotion available at that time. But at least it gives you a year at a better price, and we can definitely look at other options when that period is coming up.

Customer: But honestly, Derek, I shouldn't have even been put on the standard rate without any warning. I mean, I would have called in before this happened if I'd known.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that. That should have been communicated to you better. I'm going to add a note to your account about this, and... let me see if I can do something else here for you. (pause, typing) Actually, you know what? I'm going to apply a one-time credit to your account for this month to cover the difference—that's the thirty dollars. So your bill for this month will be just the $99.99 instead of the $129.99. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Really? Okay, that... yeah, that helps. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. So just to make sure we're clear on everything—I've applied that one-time credit, and I'm getting you set up on our twelve-month retention promotion at $99.99 per month starting next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay. And then after the twelve months, what... I just call back and we deal with it again?

Agent: Ideally, we'd reach out to you before it expires, but yes, definitely feel free to give us a call around that time frame, and we can discuss options. There may be other promotions available, or we can work out something else. But I will make sure my notes are very clear on your account so that next time any agent is looking at it, they can see this situation.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate that. And I guess I just want to know... for future reference, how do I make sure I don't miss these things? Should I be checking something online?

Agent: Great question. You can always log into your online account portal, and that'll show you your current plan details and rates. You can also call us anytime if you have questions about your bill or want to review your account. And I'd recommend, as we get closer to any promotional periods ending, just give us a call to make sure you're aware of any changes coming up.

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. Alright, Derek, I think that covers it. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: My pleasure, Sarah. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye.
