# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Marcus, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and my internet rate went up like... thirty dollars? I've been a customer for three years and I thought my promotional rate was locked in or something.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Okay, pulling that up now... And just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, 412 Maple Street.

Agent: Perfect, I've got you here. So I'm looking at your billing history, and I can see that you've been on our Fiber 500 plan at $79.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Right, that's what I've been paying for the last... I dunno, two or three years maybe.

Agent: So what happened is your promotional pricing period ended. (pause) I'm seeing here that you had a promotional rate that was set to expire on November 1st, and as of your November billing cycle, you've been moved to our standard rate, which is $109.99 a month. Did you not receive any notification about this?

Customer: I mean... maybe? I get so many emails from you guys, I don't know. But nobody told me directly, like, that my rate was going to jump that much. That's crazy. Why would you let it jump so much?

Agent: Yeah, I hear you. I apologize that you weren't aware. We do send notices typically around 60 days before the promotion expires, but I understand that can get lost in your email. (pause) The good news is I can definitely help you with some options here.

Customer: Okay, what kind of options?

Agent: Well, first let me see... (typing sounds) if there are any current promotions I can apply to your account. Hold on just one second. (brief pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that we do have a current offer for returning customers. I can get you back down to $84.99 a month for the next 12 months. Would that work for you?

Customer: Wait, so my rate would go back down? Or is that just another promotional rate that's gonna expire?

Agent: That's a great question. Yes, this would be another promotional rate for 12 months. After that, it would return to the standard rate unless we extend it again or you're on a different plan.

Customer: (sighs) So basically in a year I'm gonna be right back here having this same conversation?

Agent: I understand your concern. That's a fair point. What I can tell you is that rates do typically stay more stable after the first promotion, so we may not see as large of an increase, but I can't guarantee that. However, if you'd like, we could explore some other plan options that might work better for your long-term budget.

Customer: Like what?

Agent: Well, we have our Fiber 300 plan, which is a bit lower speed but it comes in at $69.99 a month standard rate. Would that speed be suitable for your needs, or do you really need the 500?

Customer: I mean, I use Netflix and stuff, work from home sometimes. I don't really know if I need 500, to be honest. Would 300 be enough for that?

Agent: Absolutely, yes. The 300 Mbps plan is more than sufficient for streaming video in 4K and having multiple devices online at once. It's really a solid plan for those use cases.

Customer: Okay, so if I switched to that, what would my bill be?

Agent: So if I moved you to the Fiber 300 plan right now, I could get you set up at $64.99 a month for 12 months as a promotional rate. (typing sounds) And then after 12 months, the standard rate would be $69.99.

Customer: (pause) So that's actually less than what I was paying before my rate went up.

Agent: Exactly. That way you'd actually save money compared to where you started, and the standard rate after the promotion is still lower than what your new rate would have been.

Customer: Yeah, okay... I think I want to do that. But I'm not thrilled about having to go through this again in a year, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. And here's what I want to do for you—I'm going to make a note on your account that you're a long-term customer and you've been a good customer with us. When your promotion is about to expire, I'm going to flag it for our retention team to reach out to you proactively with renewal options before your rate goes up. That way you won't be caught off guard again.

Customer: Oh, really? Okay, I appreciate that. That would help.

Agent: Absolutely. (typing sounds) So let me just confirm the changes here. I'm switching you from the Fiber 500 plan to the Fiber 300 plan, promotional rate of $64.99 for 12 months starting with your next billing cycle. Your standard rate after that would be $69.99. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all of these details. Is the email on file still valid?

Customer: Yeah, [inaudible]@gmail.com, that should be fine.

Agent: Great, you should receive that within the next few minutes. And just so you know, there's no service interruption—this change will take effect automatically on your next billing date. You should see the new rate on your December bill.

Customer: Okay, good. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: Of course! I really appreciate your patience, and I'm sorry again that the initial rate increase caught you off guard. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
