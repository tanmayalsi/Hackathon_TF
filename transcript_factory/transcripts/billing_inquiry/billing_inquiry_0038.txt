Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged... I mean, I received my statement for this month and there's a pretty significant increase that wasn't explained to anybody.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having billing concerns. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's the number we use for the internet service.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. Let me pull that up real quick here... (pause) Alright, I've got your account. I'm seeing the service is in the name of David Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned there's an increase on your bill. What are we talking about here? How much of a jump are we looking at?

Customer: Well, last month I was paying $79.99 for the Gig Speed plan, and this month it's showing $109.99. That's a thirty-dollar increase, Derek. I haven't authorized any changes to my plan, and nobody called me about this.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. That is a significant jump. Let me look into your account history here. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I'm looking at your account, and I can see that you were on a promotional rate that expired. It looks like your 12-month promotional pricing ended on September 30th, and your rate adjusted to our standard pricing on October 1st.

Customer: Hold on. Nobody told me about any promotional pricing. I've been with Frontier for... what, like four years now? This is the first I'm hearing about this expiring.

Agent: I hear you. I know that's frustrating. And I apologize that we didn't reach out to you before the promotion ended. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) Looking at your account, I do see that we sent a notification about the rate adjustment. It would have gone out about 30 days before the change...

Customer: I don't recall getting anything. And frankly, even if I did, that's not enough notice. I mean, I was locked into one price, and now suddenly it jumps to another. That doesn't seem right.

Agent: You know what, I completely understand where you're coming from. Let me see what options are available for you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so normally when a promotional period ends, we do have the ability to offer... hold on just one second. (pause) Actually, I'm showing that you might qualify for a new promotional offer. We have a current promotion for existing customers on the Gig Speed plan...

Customer: And what would that be?

Agent: It looks like we could get you set up with a 12-month promotional rate at $84.99 per month. That's not the same as your original $79.99, but it's a better rate than the standard $109.99 you're being charged now.

Customer: So I'd go from $79.99 to $84.99. That's still a five-dollar increase.

Agent: (pause) Yes, that is an increase, but it's significantly better than the $30 jump you're experiencing. And I want to be transparent with you—the market rates have gone up quite a bit over the past year. Fiber infrastructure costs have... well, they've just increased across the board. But this promotion should help bridge that gap.

Customer: Hmm. And this is guaranteed for 12 months?

Agent: Yes, sir. The promotional rate of $84.99 would be locked in for 12 months from when we apply it. After that, you know, we'd be looking at the standard rate unless another promotion becomes available at that time.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, so what happens if I don't take this? I'm just stuck paying $109.99 going forward?

Agent: That's the standard rate, yes. Unless you'd like to explore other plans that might fit your budget better. We do have the 500 Mbps plan that comes in at $69.99, which would be lower than what you're currently paying...

Customer: No, I need the Gig Speed. I work from home and I have multiple devices. The faster speed is important.

Agent: Totally understood. Gig Speed is perfect for that. So, would you like me to go ahead and apply this promotional rate of $84.99 per month?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. But I'm not happy about this, Derek. I've been a loyal customer, and I feel like I should have been contacted before my rate jumped like that.

Agent: I completely hear you, and I genuinely apologize for that experience. Honestly, this is feedback I hear from time to time, and I do think our retention team should be reaching out proactively in these situations. Would you mind if I made a note on your account about this? Sometimes that can help our management team identify where we can improve our processes.

Customer: Sure, go ahead.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm adding a note here about your concerns regarding the promotional rate expiration notification. And now let me process this promotion for you. (pause, typing sounds) Alright, so I'm applying the promotional rate effective... actually, I can backdate this to October 1st, so it would cover you for this month as well. You'll see the adjustment on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, so what do I owe for this month then?

Agent: Great question. So for this month, since we're backdating it, you would owe $84.99. The system will automatically adjust the charge from the $109.99 down to the promotional rate. You might see a credit on your account depending on whether you've already paid this month's bill.

Customer: [inaudible] ...already paid. So I should call back and ask about that?

Agent: Actually, no need to call back. The credit will be applied automatically. You might see it show up as a pending credit on your account within 24 to 48 hours, and it'll be reflected on your next billing statement. But let me give you my reference number for this ticket just in case you want to follow up. Ready?

Customer: Yeah, go ahead.

Agent: The reference number is 7-8-2-4-6-1-9-X. That's X as in xylophone. So if you have any questions about the credit or anything else, that'll help our team locate your case right away.

Customer: Alright, 7-8-2-4-6-1-9-X. Got it.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Chen?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that's it. I still don't love the situation, but I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: I really do appreciate your patience and your business. And again, I'm sorry we didn't handle the notification better on our end. If you ever need anything in the future, please don't hesitate to give us a call. We're here to help.

Customer: Will do. Thank you, Derek.

Agent: Thank you, Mr. Chen. Have a great day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: (call ends)
