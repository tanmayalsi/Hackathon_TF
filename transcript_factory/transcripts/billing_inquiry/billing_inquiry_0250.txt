Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged... I mean, I got my statement yesterday and there's like a $35 increase on my monthly payment and nobody told me about this.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about a charge increase. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... um, 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. Let me pull that up here. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account for Sarah Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Sarah. So I can see here that your bill did increase this month. Your previous bill was $79.99 and your current bill is $114.99. Is that the increase you're referring to?

Customer: Yes! Exactly. Thirty-five dollars more. And like I said, I didn't get any kind of notice about it. I've been a customer for... gosh, probably four years now, and I've always paid on time. So what's going on?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me see what happened here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your service plan. It looks like you were on our promotional rate of $79.99 for the Fiber 500 package, and that promotional period ended last month. Your account has now moved to our standard rate of $114.99 for the same service.

Customer: What? Nobody said anything about a promotional period ending. I thought that was just my rate. That's not fair.

Agent: I apologize for the confusion there. You know, we do send out notifications about the end of promotional periods, typically 30 days before the rate change takes effect. Let me check... (typing sounds) It looks like a notice was mailed to your address on file on September 15th.

Customer: September 15th? I mean... I get a lot of mail, I might not have seen it. But still, shouldn't you guys call or email people about something this important?

Agent: That's actually a really good point, and I understand where you're coming from. We do have the option to send email notifications as well. It doesn't look like you had an email address on file for account alerts, but I'd be more than happy to add that for you going forward so you don't miss anything like this in the future.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, well... I mean, is there anything you can do about the rate? Like, this is a pretty big jump. Fifty percent more? That's a lot.

Agent: I hear you. Let me look at what options we have available. (pause, typing sounds) Alright, so we do have a retention offer I can apply to your account. I can get you back down to $89.99 per month for the next 12 months. That's still a bit higher than your promotional rate was, but it's definitely better than the standard rate.

Customer: How much better? That's still ten dollars more than what I was paying.

Agent: Right, so you'd be looking at an additional ten dollars per month, which comes out to $120 more per year. But after that 12-month period, if you... if you call back before your rate is set to increase again, we can look at other promotional options that might be available at that time.

Customer: (pause) ...I don't know. I don't like feeling like I have to call in and negotiate every year to get a decent rate. Why don't you just lock it in?

Agent: I wish I could lock it in permanently for you, I really do. The promotional pricing we offer does have an end date—it's kind of how we structure our new customer offers. But I can definitely make a note on your account that you'll want to reach out before your 12 months are up, and we can discuss options at that time. A lot of customers do that and are able to get on another promotional offer.

Customer: (sighs) So basically I'm just getting locked into something else that's going to expire. This feels like you guys are trying to squeeze more money out of me.

Agent: I understand why you feel that way, and I really appreciate your loyalty as a four-year customer. That matters to us. The $89.99 offer is genuinely the best I can do right now, but if you'd prefer, I can also keep your account at the standard rate while you think about it. No pressure.

Customer: No, no... I mean, I'm not going to pay $114.99. Do you have any other customers service packages I could downgrade to? Like, do I really need the 500 speed? I mostly just stream Netflix and check email.

Agent: (typing sounds) That's a fair question. So we do have the Fiber 300 package, which is $64.99 per month, or the Fiber 100 option at $54.99. For Netflix streaming and browsing, honestly, either of those would work just fine. 300 is probably more comfortable if you have multiple devices going at the same time.

Customer: So if I downgrade to the Fiber 300, I'd be paying $64.99?

Agent: Yes, ma'am, that would be the standard rate for that package.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Okay, so I could either pay $89.99 for what I have now, or downgrade and pay $64.99. Is that the choice here?

Agent: That's exactly right. Although I should mention—if you downgrade, you'd lose some of the speed you currently have. But for your usage, like you mentioned, it should be more than adequate. And you could always upgrade back down the line if you felt you needed it.

Customer: (chuckles) You mean upgrade back? You meant downgrade back up?

Agent: (laughs) I'm sorry, yes—upgrade. Yes, you could upgrade back to the 500 package whenever you want.

Customer: Okay, um... I think I want to downgrade to the Fiber 300 for now. And then you'll put a note on my account that I should call before any changes happen?

Agent: Absolutely, I can do both of those things for you right now. Let me just confirm—you want to move to the Fiber 300 package at $64.99 per month, and I'm going to add a note to your account that you'd like a courtesy reminder before any rate changes take effect. And I'm also going to add your email address, if you'd like to provide that, so we can send you notifications going forward.

Customer: Yeah, that'd be good. It's sarah.chen.1982@emailmail.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. Okay, Sarah, all of that is set up. Your new rate of $64.99 will start on your next billing cycle, which looks like it's November 1st. So you should see that reflected on your next bill.

Customer: Okay. (pause) I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm sorry if I came in a little hot.

Agent: No, no, don't apologize at all. Your concerns were completely valid, and I'm glad we could find a solution that works better for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, Sarah. We really do appreciate your business. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
