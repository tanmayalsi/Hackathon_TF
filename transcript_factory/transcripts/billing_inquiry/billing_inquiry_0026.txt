Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged way more than usual this month and I don't understand why.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Sarah Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. Got your account right here. So you're saying your bill came in higher than normal? Let me just take a look at what we have. (pause) Okay, so your previous bill was $89.99, and this month's bill is $119.99. Is that the charge you're seeing?

Customer: Yes, exactly! That's a thirty dollar increase! I don't remember authorizing any changes to my plan, and honestly, that's just too much. Can you tell me what happened?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Sarah. Let me see what's going on here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history, and it looks like you were on our introductory rate. You had the Fiber 500 plan at $89.99 per month for the first 12 months, and that promotional period has just ended.

Customer: Wait, what? No one told me about this. I mean, I knew there was a promo rate, but I thought... I don't know, I thought someone would call me or something before just raising my price like that.

Agent: I see. I apologize that you weren't expecting that. You should have received a notice in your bill about 30 days before the rate change took effect. It's possible it may have gotten mixed in with other mail or...

Customer: (interrupting) Well, I didn't see it. And now I'm being charged thirty dollars more a month? That's almost four hundred dollars a year! Why would I want to keep the service at that price?

Agent: (pause) I totally understand where you're coming from, Sarah. That is a significant increase. Let me see what options I have available for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so the standard rate for Fiber 500 after the promotional period is $119.99. However, I do have the ability to look at what other promotions or packages might work better for your needs.

Customer: Well, what are my options? Can you lower my speed or something?

Agent: Absolutely. We have a few options. I could move you to our Fiber 300 plan, which would be $79.99 per month. That's actually a little lower than your original promotional rate. Or, I could see if you qualify for a different promotional offer.

Customer: The 300 plan... would that be fast enough? I mean, I use the internet for working from home. I have Zoom calls, I do a lot of downloading...

Agent: The Fiber 300 plan gives you 300 megabits per second download speeds, which is actually really solid for video conferencing and general work from home usage. Most people find that more than sufficient. The Fiber 500 is more if you have multiple people using the internet heavily at the same time, or if you're doing things like 4K streaming simultaneously while working.

Customer: Hmm, but I do have a roommate who works from home too. And we both like to stream...

Agent: Ah, okay. Yeah, with two people, the 500 plan might actually be better for you. Let me see... (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at a promotion I can offer you. I can get you back on the Fiber 500 for $99.99 per month for the next 12 months. That would save you twenty dollars a month compared to the standard rate. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) So it's still more than the $89.99 I was paying, but it's better than $119.99?

Agent: That's right. It's a ten dollar increase from your promotional rate, but it's twenty dollars less than the regular rate. And it locks in that price for another full year.

Customer: Is that the best you can do?

Agent: (pause) Let me check one more thing for you. (typing sounds) I'm looking at our loyalty offers... Okay, so I can actually extend that promotion. I can give you Fiber 500 for $97.99 per month for 12 months. That's the best offer I have available in your area right now.

Customer: So $97.99. That's... okay, I guess that's reasonable. That's still eight dollars more than what I was paying before though. Why should I accept a rate increase at all?

Agent: I understand your point, Sarah. The reason for the increase is that the promotional rates we offer are designed to be introductory offers for new customers or to win back customers. Once that period ends, the standard pricing does go up. However, the offer I'm providing keeps you well below our standard rate. If you were to cancel and come back as a new customer, you could potentially get another promotional rate, but that would involve canceling your service and going through the enrollment process again.

Customer: (laughs) So you're saying you want to charge me more money or I lose my service entirely?

Agent: I understand it feels that way, and I'm sorry for that. It's not ideal, I know. But the $97.99 rate is genuinely the best price I can get you locked in for the next 12 months. After that, we can look at your options again when that promotion ends.

Customer: (pause) Okay, fine. Let's do the $97.99. But I want this noted on my account that I'm not happy about this price increase.

Agent: Absolutely, I can absolutely make a note of that. And, if you don't mind, can I just set an alert for your account for next year? That way, I can make sure someone reaches out to you 30 days before your promotion ends, so you're not caught off guard again.

Customer: Yes, please do that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've made that note and set up the reminder. So your new rate of $97.99 per month for the Fiber 500 plan is effective immediately. You should see that reflected on your next billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... I think that's everything. I just wish the promo rate could've lasted longer, but I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: I appreciate your patience, Sarah. And I'm sorry again that the communication about the rate change wasn't as clear as it should have been. If you ever have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can always call us back at this number, or you can manage your account through our website or mobile app.

Customer: Okay, thanks Derek.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer, Sarah. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
