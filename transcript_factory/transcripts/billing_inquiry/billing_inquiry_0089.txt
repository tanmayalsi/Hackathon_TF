Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. It's for like, forty-five dollars, and I'm pretty sure I didn't authorize that.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... uh, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, give me just one second here... and I'm pulling up your account for Sarah Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned a forty-five dollar charge that you're not sure about. Let me take a look at your most recent bill here. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your standard fiber internet service at $79.99, and then... I do see a charge here for $45 that's labeled as "Service Upgrade Fee." Is that what you're looking at?

Customer: Yeah, that one. I didn't ask for any upgrade. My internet's been working fine. Why am I being charged for something I didn't want?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up the details on that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history, and it looks like about two weeks ago, there was an adjustment made. Do you remember if you contacted us or if there was any reason you might have requested a service change?

Customer: No, I didn't call you guys. I mean, my internet got a little slow last week, but I didn't call about it or anything. I just... I don't know, maybe it's just been the weather or something.

Agent: That makes sense. Well, let me explain what I'm seeing here. It looks like your service was upgraded from our standard 200 megabit plan to the 500 megabit plan. That's where the $45 increase per month is coming from.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't authorize that. How did that even happen?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me check to see if there's a note in the system... (pause, typing sounds) Hmm, it doesn't look like there's a record of a service request. That's unusual. Is it possible someone else on your account might have called in?

Customer: No, it's just me. My ex-boyfriend used to have access to the account, but we broke up like six months ago. Could he have... no, that doesn't make sense either. Wouldn't you need like, a password or something?

Agent: We typically do verify account information, yes. Can I ask—have there been any other changes to your account recently? Like an address change or a password reset?

Customer: (hesitating) Um... well, now that you mention it, I did get an email like three weeks ago asking me to verify my account information. I didn't click on it because it looked like spam, but I remember it seemed pretty official.

Agent: Okay, that could be it. Unfortunately, there are a lot of phishing emails out there that try to look like they're from us. It's possible someone may have accessed your account that way and made this change. I'm really sorry that happened.

Customer: So what do I do? Can you reverse this? I can't afford an extra forty-five dollars a month right now.

Agent: Absolutely, I can help you with that. First, I'd recommend changing your password as soon as we're off this call—make sure it's something strong and unique. And as for the charge, I'm going to go ahead and remove that upgrade fee from your bill. (typing sounds) That's being reversed as of today. You'll see that credit on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay... I mean, I appreciate that. But like, is the service actually upgraded right now? Like, am I getting the faster internet?

Agent: That's a good question. Yes, your service was upgraded, so you are currently getting the faster 500 megabit speeds. So you have two options here. We can keep the upgrade in place at the standard price, which would be $124.99 per month instead of your current $79.99. Or, if you'd prefer, I can downgrade you back to your original 200 megabit plan at $79.99, and there would be no additional charges.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Well, honestly, I didn't notice a huge difference in the week or so that it's been upgraded. And I really can't afford the extra forty-five dollars. So yeah, let's just downgrade me back to what I had before.

Agent: Perfect. I'll get that processed for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, the downgrade is scheduled to take effect at the start of your next billing cycle, which would be... (pause) next Tuesday, June 11th. Is that okay?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. So just to confirm, the forty-five dollar charge is coming off this bill?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. The upgrade fee will be credited to your account. You should see that reflected on your next statement in about five to seven business days. And we'll also be sending you a confirmation email of all these changes.

Customer: Great. Um, one more thing—should I call back or do something to make sure my password is changed? Or can you do that?

Agent: You'll need to change that yourself for security reasons. You can go to our website, log in, and there should be an "Account Settings" section where you can update your password. If you need any help walking through that, I can stay on the line with you.

Customer: No, I think I can figure that out. I'll do it right after we hang up.

Agent: Excellent. And Sarah, I want to apologize again for the inconvenience. It looks like someone did try to access your account fraudulently, and we want to make sure this doesn't happen again. If you see any other unauthorized charges in the future, don't hesitate to give us a call.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thank you for taking care of this. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, Sarah. Have a great day, and again, don't forget to change that password.

Customer: Will do. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
