Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm really frustrated about my bill. It went up like... thirty dollars a month, and I have no idea why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that you're frustrated. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Jennifer Walsh.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. Thank you. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account now. So you're saying your bill increased by about thirty dollars?

Customer: Yeah, it was like $89.99 last month, and this month it's $119.99. I didn't change anything. I didn't add any services or... I don't know. I'm on the same internet plan I've always been on.

Agent: I completely understand why that would be concerning. Let me take a look at what happened here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate expired. You were on a promotional pricing of $89.99 for twelve months, and that promotion ended with your last billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, a promotional rate? Nobody told me about that. I've had this service for like two years now.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for any confusion. A lot of times these promotions are applied when you first sign up, and sometimes customers aren't aware of the end date. Let me check your account history here... (pause) Yes, so it looks like you signed up for service back in March of 2022. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: So the promotion was for twelve months from that date, which would have ended in March of this year. However, I'm seeing that you were continued at that promotional rate through... (typing sounds) ...through last month. So actually you got an extra nine months at that discounted rate.

Customer: Okay, but... I mean, why am I just now being told about this? Shouldn't there have been some kind of notification?

Agent: That's a fair question. We typically do send out notifications before a rate changes. Let me see if there's a record of that... (pause) Okay, so I'm showing that a notification was sent to the email address on file about thirty days before the change took effect. Did you happen to receive an email from us around the beginning of last month?

Customer: (hesitation) Um... I mean, I get a lot of emails. I might have, but I definitely don't remember it. And shouldn't you also call or send something in the mail? Like, thirty days isn't even that much notice for something like this.

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate the feedback. You know, while I can't speak to our notification policies, I can definitely help you with your current bill. Let me see what options might be available for you. (typing sounds) So your new rate is $119.99 for our Fiber 500 plan, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Okay. And just out of curiosity, have you looked at what other internet providers in your area are charging for comparable service?

Customer: No, not really. I mean, my internet works fine. It's just the principle of it, you know? The price jump is huge.

Agent: I totally get it. Well, the good news is that I do have some options for you. We actually have a current promotion running right now for Fiber internet customers. I could offer you a rate of $99.99 per month for twelve months. That wouldn't be quite as low as what you were paying, but it's better than the $119.99, and you'd get another year of locked-in pricing.

Customer: (pause) Really? So I'd save... what, twenty dollars a month?

Agent: Yes, exactly. So that's $240 per year in savings, and you'd have the peace of mind of knowing your rate won't increase for another twelve months.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that's better. But what happens after the twelve months? Do I get bumped up again?

Agent: That's a good question. Honestly, we'd have to see what promotions are available at that time. But you'd get a notification well in advance of any changes, and you'd have the option to explore other plans or call us to discuss options at that point.

Customer: I mean... I guess that's fair. Can you at least note on my account that I should have been told about this sooner? Like, so it doesn't happen again with some other offer I didn't know about?

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely, I can add a note to your account right now. Let me just... (pause) Okay, done. I've documented that you want additional communication about any rate changes or promotional expirations in the future.

Customer: Okay, good. So you'll set me up with that $99.99 rate?

Agent: Yes, I can definitely do that for you. The new rate will take effect with your next billing cycle, which would be... (typing sounds) ...your next bill would be generated on the 18th. So you should see the new rate reflected there. You'll receive a confirmation email as well.

Customer: Alright. And just to confirm, this is locked in for a year?

Agent: Yes, twelve months from your next billing cycle. After that, your rate would go back to standard pricing unless another promotion is available or you contact us.

Customer: Okay, I can work with that. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Great. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I sincerely apologize again for the confusion with the rate change. We appreciate your business, and if you have any issues with your service or your bill in the future, please don't hesitate to give us a call.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye.
