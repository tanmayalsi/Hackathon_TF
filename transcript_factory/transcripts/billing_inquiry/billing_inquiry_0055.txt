# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. So I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and I'm pretty sure I'm being overcharged anyway. Can you help me with that?

Agent: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm getting that here... Okay, I've got you. Your name is Michael Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great, thank you. So you mentioned a charge you don't recognize and that you believe you might be overcharged. Let me take a look at your current bill. (pause) Can you tell me which charge is concerning you?

Customer: Well, first of all, my bill went up like twenty bucks this month for no reason. I'm paying $79.99 now when I was paying $59.99 last month. That's a huge jump. And then on top of that, there's this charge for like $14.99 for something called "Premium Support" that I definitely did not sign up for.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Michael. Let me look into both of those things for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing the price increase... (pause) It looks like your promotional rate expired. You were on our introductory offer of $59.99 for the first twelve months, and that ended with your last billing cycle. So you've been moved to our standard rate of $79.99 for our Fiber 200 service.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about that. How is that fair? I've been a customer for... (pause) ...well, over a year now, and I thought that was just my normal rate.

Agent: I totally understand that can be surprising. Unfortunately, promotional rates do have an expiration date, and it should have been noted in your welcome materials when you signed up. However, I do have some options that might help. But first, let me address that Premium Support charge. (typing sounds) I'm looking at when that was added to your account. It appears that was added about... ten days ago?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds about right. I definitely didn't do that. Did someone call me or something? Because I would remember that.

Agent: Let me check if there's a note on the account about how that was added. (pause, typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing any notes here about a phone call. Is it possible you may have added it online? Sometimes when customers log into their account portal, there can be promotional banners or it gets added during an upgrade process.

Customer: I mean, I guess I could have done it by accident, but... I really don't think so. I don't go on that portal very much. Can you just remove it?

Agent: Absolutely, I can remove that for you right now. That's no problem. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm taking that $14.99 Premium Support charge off your account as of today. You should see that reflected in your next billing cycle.

Customer: Thank you. I appreciate that. But I'm still stuck with this price increase, and honestly, I'm considering switching to another provider if I can't get that resolved.

Agent: I completely understand, and I want to help make this right. Let me see what I can do. (pause) So, I don't have access to apply a new promotional rate directly, but I can see that we do have a retention offer available for loyal customers like yourself. What I can do is transfer you to our retention specialist, and they'll have more flexibility to work with you on pricing. Would that be helpful?

Customer: How long is that going to take? Because I don't really want to be on the phone all day.

Agent: It should only be a few minutes. They're usually pretty quick to pick up. And Michael, just so you know, they'll have options that I don't have access to, so it's really worth the transfer.

Customer: [inaudible] ...okay, fine. Yeah, go ahead and transfer me.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I get them on the line. Your wait should be less than two minutes.

Customer: Alright.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Thank you for holding, Michael. I've got our retention specialist, Sandra, ready to help you. I'm going to go ahead and get you transferred over now.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. And thanks for being a Frontier customer. Have a great day.

Sandra: Hi Michael, this is Sandra from the retention department. Derek told me you've been a great customer and you're looking to work out your billing. How are you doing today?

Customer: I'm doing okay. He filled you in then?

Sandra: He did give me the basics. It looks like your intro rate expired and you'd like to discuss options. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I went from sixty bucks to almost eighty overnight, and that just seems like a lot. I really liked the service—the speed is great—but I can't justify paying that much when I've got other options in my area.

Sandra: I hear you. That's a bigger jump than most people expect. Let me see what I can do for you. (pause, typing sounds) So, what I'm seeing is that I can offer you a new rate of $64.99 per month for the next twelve months. That gets you below where you were before, and it locks in that rate so you won't have any surprises next year. How does that sound?

Customer: That's... actually pretty good. But why couldn't the first person just tell me that?

Sandra: That's a fair question. Derek doesn't have the authority to make those changes, but this is exactly what the retention team does. We work with customers in your situation. So does that rate work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that works. That's only five dollars more than I was paying, which is... that's reasonable. And this is guaranteed for a year?

Sandra: Absolutely. This is a twelve-month commitment at $64.99 per month. After that, we can revisit and look at options again. And we'll make sure to reach out to you before anything expires this time.

Customer: Okay, great. I appreciate that. So what happens now?

Sandra: So I'm going to lock that in for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, done. That will take effect on your next billing cycle. You should see the new rate reflected in your bill about five to seven business days from now. And Michael, I also want to make sure we don't add any services accidentally. Is your account set up the way you want it?

Customer: Yeah, I just need the basic internet. No phone, no TV. Just the fiber internet.

Sandra: Perfect. You're all set. Just the Fiber 200 internet at $64.99 per month. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thank you for working with me on this.

Sandra: You're very welcome. We appreciate your business, and thanks for giving us another chance. Have a great day, Michael.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Sandra: Bye now.
