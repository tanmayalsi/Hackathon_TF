Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my monthly rate went up. I've been a customer for like three years and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with your bill. Let me pull up your account and take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to verify, is this account under the name Michael Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great, Michael. I'm looking at your account now. So I see your service address is on Maple Street in Salem, correct?

Customer: Yes, correct.

Agent: Okay, perfect. Now, let me address your concerns here. I'm looking at your most recent bill from the 15th. Can you tell me which charge seems unfamiliar to you?

Customer: Well, I see a $15 charge for something called "Advanced Router Rental" and I... I don't remember agreeing to that. I've always had my own router.

Agent: Okay, I understand your concern. Let me look into that. (pause, typing sounds) So it looks like... hmm. I'm seeing a note here in your account that indicates you were upgraded to our Advanced Mesh WiFi system about a month ago. Do you recall having a conversation with one of our representatives about that?

Customer: No, I really don't. I mean, I haven't talked to anyone about upgrading anything. My internet's been working fine. I don't need a mesh system or whatever.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the confusion. Sometimes during routine account maintenance calls, additional services can get added. But let me make a note here that you don't want this service, and I can absolutely remove that charge from your account today.

Customer: Okay, good. But what about the price increase? My monthly bill went from $79.99 to $94.99. That's a fifteen dollar jump. Why would that happen?

Agent: (pause) Let me look at that for you. So I'm seeing that your promotional rate expired at the end of last month. You were on an introductory offer for the first two years of service, which was the $79.99 for our Gig Speed fiber plan. Now that that promotion has ended, the standard rate for that plan is $94.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, wait. So you're telling me that the deal I got when I signed up just... expires? Like, nobody told me about this?

Agent: That's a fair question, and I apologize that you didn't receive a courtesy notification about the rate change. Typically, those promotional rates do expire after the introductory period. It should have been mentioned in your initial service agreement, but I understand that's frustrating.

Customer: (sighs) This is ridiculous. I've been a loyal customer for three years. I pay my bill on time every month. And now you're charging me almost twenty percent more? And you're just... adding services without asking?

Agent: I hear your frustration, Michael, and I really do appreciate your loyalty. Those are both valid complaints. What I can do for me is, first of all, remove that Advanced Router charge immediately. That's the $15 monthly fee, and I can actually remove that charge from your last bill as well since you didn't authorize it. So that'll credit back to you.

Customer: Okay, that's something.

Agent: (typing sounds) Second, regarding the rate increase—I want to be upfront with you. That $94.99 is our standard rate. However, I do have the ability to offer you a loyalty rate. Since you've been such a good customer, I can offer you a retention rate of $84.99 per month for the next 12 months on that same Gig Speed plan. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) That's better than $94.99, but it's still higher than what I was paying before.

Agent: You're absolutely right, it is. And I'm not going to tell you it's the same as your promotional rate—I can't do that. But I'm trying to find a middle ground here that's fair to you. After those 12 months, the rate would go back to the standard $94.99, but we can revisit your options at that time. Maybe you've earned another promotional offer by then.

Customer: How do I know that's actually going to happen? Like, is this in writing?

Agent: Great question. Yes, absolutely. I'm going to send you an email confirmation of everything we've discussed today—the removal of the Advanced Router service, the $15 credit back to your last bill, and this new retention rate of $84.99 for 12 months. You should receive that within the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay, that's fine. So just to be clear, my bill next month should be $84.99?

Agent: (pause) Actually, let me clarify that. Your next bill will reflect the removal of the $15 router charge, so it should be $79.99 for this billing cycle. And then starting with your bill after that—so that would be around the 15th of next month—it will be $84.99 per month going forward.

Customer: All right. And the $15 credit for the unauthorized charge?

Agent: That will appear on your next bill as a credit. You should see it itemized as "Service Adjustment Credit - $15.00."

Customer: Okay. I guess I'm... I mean, I'm not thrilled about the overall situation, but at least you're doing something about it.

Agent: I really appreciate your patience, Michael, and I'm sorry that we got off on the wrong foot with that unauthorized service. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your service or your account?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Just... maybe have someone check to make sure no other services got added without me knowing about it?

Agent: That's an excellent point, and I'm going to make a note on your account right now about that. I'm flagging it so that if there are any changes going forward, you'll get a direct call from us before anything is added. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that's good. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you, Michael. I really do appreciate your business with Frontier, and I'm sorry for the frustration today. You should receive that email confirmation shortly. Is there a preferred email address on file for you, or should I send it to the one we have on record?

Customer: The one on file is fine.

Agent: Perfect. You're all set. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great day.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
