Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I don't know, something doesn't look right. My internet bill went up like thirty bucks, and I have no idea why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. One second... (pause) Alright, I've got your account here. Your name is Michael Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. I can definitely understand your concern about a price increase. Let me take a look at your recent billing history. (typing sounds) So I'm looking at your last bill from November, which was $79.99, and your current bill from December is showing as $109.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm talking about. I've been paying seventy-nine ninety-nine for like... I don't know, at least two years. Why would it suddenly jump thirty dollars? Did you guys change my plan without asking me?

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. Let me look into what happened here. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that you were enrolled in an introductory pricing period that expired. You were on our Fiber 100 plan with a promotional rate, and that promo ended at the end of November.

Customer: Wait, wait... I don't remember signing up for any promo. I mean, I've just been paying what I've been paying. Nobody told me this was temporary.

Agent: I understand. Let me check your account notes here. (typing sounds) Looking back at when you signed up in... October of 2021, the promotional rate was for a twelve-month period. So it would have ended around October of this year, but it looks like we extended it for you once, so it went through November.

Customer: Okay, but nobody called me. I didn't get any notification that this was ending. I would've... I mean, if I knew my bill was going to triple, I would've done something about it.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Michael. That's actually a valid point. Let me check if we sent any notifications. (pause, typing sounds) I'm seeing that we should have sent you an email notification about thirty days before the promo expired. Did you happen to receive an email from Frontier?

Customer: (pause) I... I don't know. I get so much email. I probably didn't see it, but still, you know, you guys should call people or something. That's a huge jump.

Agent: That's fair feedback. I hear you. The good news is that I have some options for you. First of all, let me tell you what you're currently paying for. Your Fiber 100 plan now is $109.99 per month, which gives you 100 Mbps download speeds.

Customer: So what, that's just the regular price now?

Agent: Yes, that's our standard rate for that speed tier. However, what I can do is look at other plans and options we have available. We actually have a Fiber 50 plan that would be $59.99 a month, and we also have a Fiber 200 plan at $129.99. Or... (pause) I can also look into some promotional offers we might be able to apply to your account as a courtesy.

Customer: I don't want to downgrade to 50. The 100 is fine for what I need. And I'm definitely not paying more. Can you just... I don't know, can you put me back on the promotional rate?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we can do here. Unfortunately, I'm not able to reactivate the same promotional period, but what I can do is apply a one-time credit to your account for the difference between what you were paying and what you're paying now. That would be about thirty dollars.

Customer: A one-time credit? So you're just going to credit me thirty bucks and then next month I'm back to paying 109.99?

Agent: That's correct. It would help offset the increase for this month, but your going forward rate would be the $109.99 unless we can find another option.

Customer: That's... that's not really a solution. Look, I've been a customer for almost three years. I pay on time. I haven't had any problems. And you guys just bump up my rate without properly notifying me. Is there anything else you can do? Can I talk to a supervisor or something?

Agent: I absolutely understand your frustration, and I appreciate your loyalty as a customer. (pause) Let me see what else I can do here for you. Actually, I do have the ability to apply a promotional rate for a select few loyal customers. Let me check my current promotional inventory. (typing sounds, longer pause) Okay, Michael, I can offer you a six-month promotional rate of $84.99 on your Fiber 100 plan. That would bring your bill down by twenty-five dollars.

Customer: Six months? And then what, it goes back up to 109?

Agent: After the six months, yes, it would go back to our standard rate of $109.99 unless we have other offers available at that time. But this would give you some time, and you'd be paying less than you were before.

Customer: (pause) I mean... that's better than nothing, I guess. But I'm still frustrated about how this was handled. This feels like bait and switch to me.

Agent: I hear you, and I'm sorry you feel that way. We definitely should've done a better job communicating the end of your promotional period. I'm going to make a note on your account about your feedback regarding the notification process. And if you'd like, I can also register a formal complaint that our management team will review.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Add that to my account. And so the six-month promo... when does that start?

Agent: It would start with your next billing cycle, which would be January 1st. So your January bill would be $84.99, and then it would run through June 30th. You'll receive a new bill summary via email once it's applied, which should be within the next 24 hours.

Customer: Alright. I mean, I appreciate you doing something, but I'm still not happy about how this was handled.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry we frustrated you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... that's it. Thank you.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, Michael, and thank you for your patience. We really do appreciate your business. You should see that promotional credit on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Have a great day.

Customer: You too.
