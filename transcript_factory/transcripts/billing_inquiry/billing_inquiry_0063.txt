# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that shouldn't be there. My internet bill went up like thirty dollars out of nowhere.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you figure this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And just to confirm, is this for the service address on Maple Street in Portland?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account here. So I see your bill went from $89.99 to $119.99 this month. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yes! Exactly that. That's a thirty-dollar jump. I've been paying $89.99 for... I don't know, like two years now? And I never agreed to any price increase. Nobody called me or sent me anything about this.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me look into what happened here. (typing sounds) So it looks like on January 15th, your promotional rate expired. You were on a promotional offer that was $89.99 for 12 months, and that period ended, so you're now on our standard rate for Frontier Fiber 500.

Customer: Okay, but... I mean, I don't remember being told about an expiration date. And that's a huge jump. What am I paying for exactly?

Agent: That's a fair question. The $119.99 includes your Fiber 500 internet service, which is our 500 megabits per second download speed, plus we have taxes and regulatory fees included in there as well. But I totally understand—that's a significant increase from the promotional price.

Customer: I mean, I'm not paying $120 a month for internet. That's ridiculous. What other options do I have?

Agent: (pause) Well, I have a few things I can look at for you. First, do you have any other services with us? TV or phone?

Customer: No, just internet. I use streaming services instead of cable.

Agent: Gotcha. Okay, so what I can do is... let me check what promotional offers we have available right now. (typing sounds) Give me just one second here...

Customer: Alright.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so unfortunately our current promotions are pretty limited this month, but I do have one option. I can put you on our Fiber 300 service instead, which is 300 megabits per second, and that would bring your rate down to $79.99 for the first year.

Customer: So I'd have to downgrade my speed?

Agent: You would, yes. It would be 300 megabits instead of 500. But for most people, that's still plenty for streaming, working from home... I mean, unless you're doing something pretty heavy with downloads or you have a lot of people on the network.

Customer: How many people are we talking about? I mean, what's the threshold?

Agent: (pause) So 300 megs is really good for up to... I'd say four to five people streaming simultaneously without any lag. With 500, you're looking at more capacity, so it handles heavier usage better.

Customer: I live by myself, so... (pause) I guess 300 would work. But I'm also looking at what Comcast is offering in my area. They've been sending me offers for like $69.99 a month.

Agent: Oh, I hear you. Okay, so let me be honest with you—I want to keep you as a Frontier customer because our Fiber service is really reliable, and we don't have data caps like some other providers. But I don't want you to feel like you're paying too much. Let me see if I can do a little better for you. (typing sounds) [inaudible] hold on just one second...

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (brief hold music plays, then resumes) Alright, I'm back. So what I can do for you is... I can actually honor the $89.99 rate for an additional 12 months if you're willing to stay with us on the Fiber 500 service.

Customer: Wait, really? How long is that good for?

Agent: That would be one year, so 12 months from now. After that, it would adjust to the standard rate. But I will also send you a courtesy notice 30 days before the promotion ends so you're not surprised again.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's actually pretty good. So I'm locked in at $89.99 for the next year?

Agent: That's correct. Yes. I'm gonna make a note on the account right now, and I'll also send you an email confirmation with all the details of this promotion, including the end date.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. So do I need to do anything, or...?

Agent: No, you don't need to do anything on your end. The rate will just adjust on your next billing cycle. Your next bill should reflect that. And again, you'll get that notice before the year is up, so you'll have plenty of time to make a decision about your service.

Customer: Great. Is there anything else I should know about?

Agent: (pause) Just... honestly, make sure to keep an eye on your emails and statements so you don't miss that notice. A lot of customers do, and then they're surprised by the increase. But as long as you're aware, you should be good.

Customer: Yeah, I will. Thanks for taking care of that for me.

Agent: Of course! And hey, if you ever have any issues with your service or questions, don't hesitate to give us a call back, okay? We're here 24/7.

Customer: Thanks, I appreciate it.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
