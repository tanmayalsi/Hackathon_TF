Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. It's like... it jumped up significantly from what I've been paying.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, sure. It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And can I also get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under Michael Chen.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, Michael. I've got your account here. So you're saying your bill increased? Let me just take a look at your recent charges here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing your account. What amount were you expecting versus what you received?

Customer: Well, I've been paying like $89.99 a month for the last year or so, right? And this month it came through as $129.99. That's like forty bucks more. I don't understand why.

Agent: Wow, okay. That is a pretty significant jump. Let me review your account history here to see what might have changed. (typing sounds, pause) I'm looking at your billing here, Michael, and I can see that you're right—you have been on a promotional rate of $89.99 for the Gig Speed internet service. That promotional period appears to have ended.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't know anything about a promotional period ending. I thought that was just my rate. Like, nobody told me this was going to happen.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me explain what I'm seeing. It looks like you signed up for that plan about fourteen months ago, and the promotion was for twelve months. So after that twelve-month window, the rate adjusts to our standard pricing, which for the Gig Speed service is $129.99 a month.

Customer: But that's crazy. Nobody told me about this. I mean, I would've... I don't know, I wouldn't have signed up if I knew I was gonna get hit with this big increase. Shouldn't you guys send some kind of notice or something?

Agent: That's a very fair point, and I apologize that you're frustrated. We should have sent you a courtesy notice. Let me see what I can do to help make this right. (pause) Can you give me just one second? I'm going to check what options we have available for you.

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, Michael, so what I can do is I can apply a six-month promotional credit to your account that would bring your rate back down to $99.99 a month. That's still higher than what you were paying, but it's a little bit of a middle ground while we get you set up on a better long-term plan.

Customer: Six months? And then it goes back up to $129.99 after that?

Agent: That would be the standard rate, yes. However, once we get you on this new promotional period, we can absolutely reach out to you before it ends and discuss other options that might be available. We could potentially look at bundling services, or there may be other promotions running at that time.

Customer: (sighs) That doesn't really make me feel better, to be honest. I mean, I liked the service and the speeds are great, but I feel like I'm being nickel-and-dimed here. Is there anything else you can do?

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from. Let me check one more thing. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so what I can do is I can actually extend that promotional rate for nine months instead of six. That would give you until... let's see, about nine months from now before we'd need to revisit your pricing. How does that sound?

Customer: Nine months at $99.99?

Agent: Correct. That would bring your July bill down from $129.99 to $99.99, and that would hold through... (typing sounds) ...through March of next year.

Customer: Okay, well, that's better than the six months, I guess. But I still feel like I should've been notified about this change coming.

Agent: You know what, you're absolutely right about that. And I want to make a note on your account about that feedback. It's definitely something that should've been communicated better, and I apologize on behalf of Frontier for that oversight. I'm going to add a comment here so that when we reach out to you in March, we make sure it's a proactive conversation, not a surprise on your bill.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Well, I appreciate that, at least. So when does this credit show up?

Agent: Great question. The credit will apply to your next billing cycle, which should be in the next few days. You should see the adjustment on your bill when that processes. You'll get an email confirmation of the change, and you can also log into your account online anytime to verify it.

Customer: Alright. What's my confirmation number or something?

Agent: (typing sounds) Your reference number for this change is 847-FCI-5591. I'd recommend writing that down in case you need to reference it.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I got it. 847-FCI-5591.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Michael?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm still not thrilled about all this, but... I appreciate you working with me on it.

Agent: I really do understand your frustration, and I genuinely apologize that your experience wasn't better from the start. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. Goodbye.

Agent: Goodbye, Michael, and have a great day.
