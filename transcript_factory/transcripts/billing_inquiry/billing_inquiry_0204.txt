# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I've been a customer for like... three years now? And I need to figure out what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. Just one second... Alright, I've got your account here under Michael Torres. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. And what charge are you seeing that concerns you?

Customer: There's a $15 charge that just appeared on this month's bill. It says "Equipment Rental Fee" but I own my router. I bought it from Best Buy like two years ago. Why am I being charged for equipment I don't even rent from you?

Agent: (pause) I understand your frustration, Michael. Let me look into that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that your account does show an active equipment rental on file. That would typically be for a modem and router combo unit. Do you remember if you ever had one of those from us?

Customer: No, I don't think so. Like I said, I bought my own router. I plugged it in and it worked fine. Why would I rent one from you when I already have one?

Agent: That's a fair question. Sometimes what happens is when customers set up their own equipment, the system doesn't always automatically remove the older rental charges. Let me check your service history here... (typing sounds) Hmm, okay. So according to this, you were originally on a plan that included equipment rental when you first signed up three years ago.

Customer: Right, but I changed that. I mean, I called in before—I think it was about two years ago—and I told somebody that I was using my own equipment and didn't need yours anymore.

Agent: (pause) I'm looking through the notes here, and... I'm not seeing a record of that conversation. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. Our notes aren't always perfect. Can you remember approximately when that was?

Customer: It was... sometime in 2022, I think? Maybe late 2022 or early 2023? I remember because I had just bought the router and it was working great, so I figured why pay you guys for the same thing.

Agent: That makes total sense. And I appreciate you reaching out about this because that's exactly what we want to know about. So here's what I can do for you. I'm going to remove that equipment rental charge from your account effective immediately. And let me see... (typing sounds) I'm going to credit your account for this month's fee since this should have been taken off a long time ago.

Customer: Oh, okay. So I'm getting that $15 back?

Agent: Absolutely. You'll see that credit on your next bill. Actually, let me check something real quick. (brief hold music plays) Okay, I'm back. I'm going to go ahead and credit you for the last two months as well, just to make things right. So that's $45 total that'll show up as a credit.

Customer: Really? Wow, okay. Thank you. That's... that's actually really helpful.

Agent: Of course. I want to make sure we get this squared away. Now, just to confirm—you're definitely using your own equipment and not renting anything from us, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I have my own modem and router, both from Best Buy.

Agent: Perfect. I've removed the equipment rental line item from your account completely, so you shouldn't see that charge going forward. Your bill should just show your service plan now, which is our Frontier Fiber 500 plan at $89.99 a month, correct?

Customer: Wait... hold on. My bill this month was $104.99, not $89.99. Is there something else on here?

Agent: (typing sounds) Ah, okay, let me look at that. Yeah, so you're right. You have the base service at $89.99, and then there's a $15 equipment rental that we just discussed. But that adds up to $104.99. So... hmm. Let me look at your itemized charges here...

Customer: See, that's what I'm saying. When I first signed up, it was like $79 a month or something. And now it's way more. Did my rate go up?

Agent: (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing here that you were grandfathered into an older rate for a while, but that promotional period ended about four months ago. So yes, your rate did increase to the standard pricing for the Fiber 500 plan, which is $89.99 per month. I know that's frustrating when you see a price increase like that.

Customer: Four months ago? Why didn't anybody tell me about this?

Agent: That should have been communicated to you in writing before the change went into effect. We're required to send out notifications at least 30 days in advance. Did you maybe not receive that, or...?

Customer: I mean, I get a lot of mail. I might have thrown it away without reading it. But still, you could've mentioned it.

Agent: I understand. So you're right that there was an increase there. The good news is we do have some options. We could potentially look into a different plan that might be more in line with what you were originally paying. Or if you're happy with the speeds you're getting, we might have some promotional offers available for you as a loyalty customer.

Customer: How much would a different plan be?

Agent: (typing sounds) Well, we have our Fiber 300 plan at $79.99 a month, which would bring you closer to what you were paying before. The main difference is you'd have 300 megabits per second instead of 500. Would that work for you?

Customer: What kind of speeds are we talking about? Like, is that fast enough for streaming and stuff?

Agent: Absolutely. Three hundred megabits is more than enough for streaming, video calls, online gaming, multiple devices streaming at the same time—all of that. Most people don't even use that full speed capacity.

Customer: Yeah, okay. That sounds good. I don't really need super fast internet. I just use it for Netflix and browsing and stuff.

Agent: Perfect. So I can switch you over to the Fiber 300 plan effective on your next billing cycle. That'll bring your monthly rate down to $79.99. And just to recap, I'm also applying those credits we discussed—the $45 for the equipment rental fees—which will show up on your next bill. So your first bill on the new plan would actually be... (typing sounds) ...let me calculate that. You'd owe $79.99 minus $45, so $34.99 for the next month.

Customer: Okay, that's much better. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: My pleasure, Michael. I'm sorry you had to call in about this, but I'm glad we got it sorted out. Just to summarize what we're doing: we're removing the equipment rental charge, crediting you $45, and moving you to our Fiber 300 plan at $79.99 a month. You should see all of that reflected on your next billing statement, which will be sent to you on the 15th of next month.

Customer: Great. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer, Michael. You have a great day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Goodbye.
