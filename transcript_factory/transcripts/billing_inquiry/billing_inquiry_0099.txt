# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I think I was overcharged, or... I'm not even sure what this is.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you figure this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my service number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. Let me pull that up here... And just to confirm, is this for the address on file at 2341 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you. Now, what charge are you seeing that concerns you?

Customer: So I'm looking at my bill here, and last month I was paying $79.99 for my internet service. This month it jumped to $94.99. That's a fifteen dollar increase out of nowhere. I never agreed to any price hike, and... I mean, I haven't changed my service or anything.

Agent: (pause) I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at your account here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate actually expired at the end of last billing cycle. Your account had a twelve-month promotional pricing that started about a year ago, and now you're transitioning to our standard rate for Fiber 500 service.

Customer: Well, nobody told me about that. I mean, shouldn't you guys have sent me a notice or something?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me check... (typing sounds) It looks like a notice was sent to your email address on file about thirty days before the rate change. Did you happen to receive that?

Customer: I... I don't know. I probably didn't see it. I get so many emails. But the thing is, I was told when I signed up that the price wouldn't go up. I remember specifically asking about that because I'm on a fixed income, and my husband just retired last year.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you're going through that. Unfortunately, promotional rates do have expiration dates, and... (brief pause) ...they're required to end at some point. However, I do want to see what options we might have available to you. Let me check our current promotions for your area.

Customer: Well, I appreciate that. I've been a customer for... I want to say close to three years now? And I've never had any issues with the service itself. It's just this price thing that's frustrating me.

Agent: (typing sounds) Three years, that's fantastic. I can definitely see that in your account. You've been a great customer with no service issues or late payments. Let me see here... (pause) Okay, so we do have a promotion available right now for existing customers like yourself. I can offer you a rate of $84.99 for the next twelve months on the same Fiber 500 service. That would be $10 less than what you're currently being charged.

Customer: Hmm. So that's still ten dollars more than what I was paying before, though.

Agent: (pause) Yes, you're right. That's true. The thing is, the promotional rate you had before was at our introductory pricing level. I understand it's an increase from what you were accustomed to paying. Let me see if there's anything else I can do here...

Customer: I just... I need to know if I can get back to the $79.99. That was manageable for us. If not, I might have to look at other providers in our area.

Agent: (typing sounds) I hear you on that. Let me put you on a very brief hold while I check with my supervisor to see if we have any additional options for loyal customers in your situation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yeah, okay. How long do you think?

Agent: It should just be a moment or two. I really appreciate your patience.

Customer: (pause) Okay.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, then fades)

Agent: Thank you so much for holding. Okay, so I was able to speak with my supervisor, and here's what we can do. Because of your three-year tenure with us and your excellent payment history, I'm authorized to offer you a special retention rate of $82.99 per month for the next eighteen months on your Fiber 500 service. That would bring your bill down from the $94.99. Now, this is the best I can offer, but it's a genuine discount that accounts for your loyalty.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so that's thirteen dollars less than the new rate. That's... that's actually better. Can you guarantee that won't go up during those eighteen months?

Agent: That's a great question. Yes, this rate is locked in for the full eighteen months. So you won't see an increase during that period. After eighteen months, you would be subject to our standard rates at that time, but we'll send you notices well in advance so you're not caught off guard like this time.

Customer: Alright. Yeah, I think... I think I can work with that. Can you just make sure that you send me an email reminder or something before that eighteen months is up, so I'm aware ahead of time?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll make a note on your account right now that we should reach out to you at least forty-five days before that promotional period ends. (typing sounds) And I'm going to add your email to the list for proactive customer notifications, so you'll get an email and potentially a letter as well.

Customer: Thank you. I appreciate that. I was just really caught off guard by the increase.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm really glad we were able to work something out for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your account or service?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you again for going to bat for me.

Agent: My pleasure. I've got your new rate of $82.99 set to start on your next billing cycle, which is coming up on the 15th. You should see that reflected on your next bill. Thank you so much for being a valued Frontier customer, and if you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Will do. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Thank you for calling Frontier.
