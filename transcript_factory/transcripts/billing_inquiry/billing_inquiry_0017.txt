# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm seeing a charge that I don't recognize. It's like... it jumped up almost thirty dollars from last month.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. Let me just pull that up here... (pause) Alright, I've got your account. I'm seeing your account under Michael Torres, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned a charge that seems higher than usual. Can you tell me roughly what your normal bill is, and what you're seeing this month?

Customer: Okay, so normally I'm paying like... I think it's around one-oh-five, maybe one-ten? But this month it's showing one thirty-nine. That's, that's a big jump. I didn't change anything. I didn't add any services or anything like that.

Agent: (typing) Mm-hmm, I understand that's frustrating. Let me just look at your billing details here. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at your account, and I do see that we did apply a rate adjustment to your plan effective this month.

Customer: A rate adjustment? What do you mean? Nobody told me about that.

Agent: I understand. So we did send out a notice about thirty days ago regarding updates to our pricing in your area. It looks like your Internet 500 plan increased by... (pause) twenty-eight dollars per month.

Customer: (sighs) That's ridiculous. I've been with you guys for what, like five or six years now? And you just... you just raise the price without really... I mean, I got something in the mail but I thought that was just like junk mail, you know?

Agent: Yeah, I hear you. These notifications can sometimes get overlooked, and I totally understand your frustration. Unfortunately, the rate adjustments are applied across our service area as our infrastructure costs and operational expenses increase. But let me see what options we might have for you.

Customer: What kind of options? Can you just lower it back?

Agent: (pause) So I can't reverse the rate adjustment itself, but what I can do is look at your current plan and see if there are any promotional offers available to you. Let me check... (typing sounds) 

Customer: How much would it be if I... I don't know... if I downgraded or something?

Agent: That's actually a good question. So if you moved down to our Internet 300 plan, that would be ninety-nine dollars per month, which would save you about forty dollars compared to what you're currently paying.

Customer: But that's slower, right? I use the five hundred because I work from home. I'm on video calls all day.

Agent: Right, so the Internet 300 is definitely adequate for video conferencing and most work-from-home tasks, but if you're doing a lot of simultaneous uploads or downloads, the Internet 500 is the better choice.

Customer: Yeah, see, that's... I mean, I need the faster speed. That's why I had it in the first place. So I'm basically just stuck paying more for the same service?

Agent: (pause) I understand the frustration there. Let me see what I can actually do for you. Give me just one moment. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so looking at your account history, I'm seeing that you've been a customer for six years without any service issues, and you're current on all your payments, which is great. 

Customer: Thanks, I guess.

Agent: So what I can do is apply a courtesy credit to your account for the first three months of the rate increase. That would bring your bill back down to around one-eleven for the next three months, and then it would adjust to the full rate after that. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) So you're only helping me for three months? What happens after that? I'm right back to one thirty-nine?

Agent: That's correct, unfortunately. These promotional credits are typically offered on a temporary basis. However, after those three months, if you're interested in discussing your options again, you're welcome to give us a call back, and we can look at what might be available at that time. Things do change, and we might have different promotional offers.

Customer: This is just... I really don't appreciate having to call in to complain to get some help with a charge I didn't authorize. I didn't ask for a price increase.

Agent: And I completely understand where you're coming from. I wish I had more flexibility on this situation. These rate adjustments are determined by our pricing team based on regional factors, but your feedback about the lack of clarity in the notification is really valid, and I want to make sure that's noted on your account. (typing sounds)

Customer: Yeah, okay. So what, the credit applies starting now?

Agent: Yes, so I'm going to apply that three-month credit effective immediately. You should see that reflected on your next billing cycle. Your new bill should show the credit applied, and you'll get an updated statement. You'll still see the base rate of one thirty-nine, but then the credit will subtract out the adjustment for those three months.

Customer: (pause) Alright. I guess... I mean, I guess that's better than nothing. But I'm not happy about this.

Agent: I understand, and your frustration is completely valid. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... yeah, that's it. I just hope you guys don't pull this again next year.

Agent: [inaudible] ...definitely appreciate you bringing this to our attention, and I'm going to add a note to your account that you'd like a courtesy phone call notification in the future rather than just mail notification for any rate changes. How does that sound?

Customer: Yeah, actually that would be... yeah, that's good. Thank you.

Agent: Perfect. You're all set then, Michael. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's everything.

Agent: Alright, well thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and thank you for being a customer with us for the past six years. We really appreciate your business. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: Thanks. You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
