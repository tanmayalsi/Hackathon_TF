Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that doesn't make any sense to me.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's area code 503, then 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And your name?

Customer: It's James Martinez.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, James. I'm pulling up your account now. So you mentioned there's a charge that seems off. Can you tell me which charge you're referring to?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill this month is $127.50, and last month it was $89.99. That's like a $40 increase basically overnight, and I haven't added any services or anything. I want to know why I'm being charged more.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, James. Let me take a look at what's on your account. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm looking at your billing history here. So you're right—last month you were at $89.99 for our Fiber 200 plan. This month, the bill shows $127.50.

Customer: Right, so what's going on? Did you guys raise your rates or something?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me see... (pause, typing) Okay, so it looks like you had a promotional rate that expired. You were on an introductory pricing for your first year, and that ended at the end of last month. So your rate has adjusted to our standard pricing.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. Nobody told me about this. I mean, if I'd known there was a promo rate, I would've... I don't know, at least been prepared for it. This is the first I'm hearing about it.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize that you didn't see that coming. Let me check your account notes here to see if there was any notification sent out. (typing sounds, pause) So it looks like we did send you an email notification about 30 days before the expiration, and there should also have been a notice on your bill.

Customer: I mean... I get a lot of emails. I probably missed it. But still, $40 more a month is a lot. That's like $500 a year extra. Can you help me out here?

Agent: I totally get it. Fiber is a premium service, but I don't want to lose you over pricing. Let me see what options I have available for you. (pause, typing sounds) 

Customer: Okay, because I'm also looking at your website right now, and it says new customers get Fiber 200 for $79.99 a month for a year. So why am I paying more than that as an existing customer?

Agent: That's... that's actually a really good point, James. You're right that we do have promotional rates for new customers. (pause) Let me check what I can do for you. I want to be upfront though—I don't have the ability to match brand new customer pricing, but I do have some loyalty options that might help.

Customer: What kind of loyalty options are we talking about?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so here's what I can do. I can apply a $20 monthly credit to your account for the next 12 months. That would bring your bill down to $107.50, which is still higher than your promotional rate, but it's a significant reduction from the $127.50.

Customer: So that's still $17 more than what I was paying before. That doesn't really feel like loyalty. That feels like I'm getting punished for being a customer.

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate your frustration. (pause) You know what, let me see if I can do a little better. Hold on one second while I check with my supervisor on what additional options might be available.

Customer: Sure, I guess.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Okay, James, I'm back. So I was able to get approval for an additional option. How about this—I can give you $25 a month credit for 12 months, which would bring your bill down to $102.50. That's closer to your original promotional rate.

Customer: (pause) So that's $12.51 more than I was paying. That's still an increase.

Agent: It is, and I recognize that. Unfortunately, that's the best I'm able to offer you within the parameters I have access to. The reality is that promotional pricing is just that—it's promotional. The standard pricing for Fiber 200 in your area is $127.50. What I'm trying to do here is bridge that gap for you.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Okay, well... I guess that's better than nothing. But I want to know—when does this $25 credit end? Because I don't want to be in the same position a year from now.

Agent: That's an excellent question. So the $25 credit is guaranteed for 12 months from today. After that, your rate would go back to the standard $127.50 unless we work something out closer to that time. But here's what I can do—I can make a note on your account that you're a valued customer and that you were concerned about the price increase, so when you call in around month 11 or 12, the team will know your situation and we can explore options at that time.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, that sounds fair. I mean, I like your service—the internet is fast and it's been pretty reliable. I just wish I'd gotten more of a heads-up about this.

Agent: I really appreciate that, and I'm sorry we didn't communicate that better. Going forward, I'm going to make sure you get a better notification before any rate changes. Let me just confirm these details with you. So I'm applying a $25 monthly credit for 12 months, effective immediately. Your new bill will be $102.50 per month for the next year. Does that sound right?

Customer: Yeah, okay. That sounds good.

Agent: Great. (typing sounds) And I'm also going to email you a confirmation of this adjustment right away. Is the email on the account still current?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today, James?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: My pleasure. Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and I'm sorry again for the confusion on the rate change. If you have any other questions or issues, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you. Goodbye!
