Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I mean, I've been with you guys for like three years and my bill just jumped up almost thirty dollars. I want to know what's going on with that.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about a charge on your account. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. One second... Alright, I've got your account here. Your name is Michael Patterson?

Customer: Yep, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your bill increased. Let me take a look at your current plan and your recent billing history. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing that your previous bill was $89.99, and your current bill is now $119.99. Is that the increase you're referring to?

Customer: Yes! Exactly. That's like... that's a thirty dollar jump. Why would it go up that much all of a sudden? I haven't added any services or anything.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) So I'm looking at your account, and it looks like your introductory rate expired. You were enrolled in our promotional pricing for the first year of service, which gave you the Gigabit Fiber plan at $89.99 a month.

Customer: Wait, wait... so you're telling me I'm now being charged the regular price? Nobody told me about that. How is that fair?

Agent: I apologize if that wasn't clearly communicated to you when you first signed up. Unfortunately, most of our promotional rates do have an expiration date—typically after the first twelve months. However, I do understand this is a significant increase, and I'd like to see what options we have available for you.

Customer: This is ridiculous. I mean, I chose Frontier because you guys had the best rates in my area. If I'd known this was gonna happen, I... I don't know, I probably would've locked in a contract or something.

Agent: I hear you. Let me check what promotions or plan adjustments might be available to you right now. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm showing that we do have a customer loyalty rate available for you. I could move you to our standard Gigabit Fiber plan at $99.99 per month, which would be a savings compared to the regular rate you're currently on.

Customer: So that would save me twenty dollars from what I'm being charged now?

Agent: That's correct. It would bring you down from the $119.99 to $99.99 per month. That's still a ten dollar increase from your introductory rate, but it does give you some relief.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Is that the best you can do? I mean, come on, we've been customers for three years. I've never missed a payment, I've been reliable...

Agent: I really do appreciate your loyalty, and you're right—you have an excellent payment history with us. Let me see if there's anything else I can offer. (typing sounds, pause) Actually, I'm going to add a courtesy credit to your account for $29.99 to help offset this billing cycle. And I can lock in that $99.99 rate for you for the next twelve months so you know what to expect going forward.

Customer: A credit? Really?

Agent: Yes, I want to make this right. And moving forward, you'll be at $99.99 per month, and you won't see another increase for at least a year. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's... that's better. I appreciate that. So the credit will show up on my next bill?

Agent: It should appear within one to two billing cycles. I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all these details—the rate change, the credit amount, and the terms of your new rate lock. You should see that within the next few minutes.

Customer: Alright, thank you. I mean, I'm still not thrilled about the increase overall, but at least you're working with me on it.

Agent: I'm glad I could help. And I want to apologize again for any confusion around the promotional rate expiration. If you have any questions about your bill going forward, or if there's anything else I can help you with, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Will do. I appreciate it, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being such a loyal customer. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
