Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I received my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that wasn't on my last bill. It's like a $15 increase and I want to know what that's about.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking that up now. And what name is the account under?

Customer: Sarah Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. I've got your account here. So you're saying there's an increase from your previous bill?

Customer: Yeah, the last two months I was paying $89.99 for my internet service, and now this bill is showing $104.99. That's fifteen dollars more and I have no idea why. Did my plan change or something?

Agent: Let me take a look at what's on your account. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that... yes, it looks like your introductory rate expired. You were on our promotional rate, which was $89.99 for twelve months, and that ended with last month's billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, what? I never agreed to a promotional rate. I thought that was just my regular price. Nobody told me it was going to go up.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Sarah. Let me check your account notes here to see... (pause) Okay, so when you signed up with us back in February, you did receive our Fiber 300 plan at the promotional rate of $89.99 per month for the first year. After that year, it does move to our standard rate, which is $104.99.

Customer: That's ridiculous. I mean, why would they... why would you offer a price for a year and then just jack it up like that? That's not right.

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from. A lot of customers feel the same way. Unfortunately, that promotional period has ended, so your account has transitioned to the standard pricing. However, I do have some options that might help. Let me see what we can do here.

Customer: Okay, well... I mean, can you just put me back on the original price? I've been a customer for over a year now. I don't understand why I should have to pay more.

Agent: That's a great question. Unfortunately, I'm not able to retroactively apply the promotional rate since it's already expired. However, I can offer you a couple of things. First, let me check if there are any current retention offers available for your account... (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that I can offer you a six-month rate reduction to $94.99 per month, which would save you ten dollars a month compared to your current bill.

Customer: So I'd still be paying more than what I was paying before, just... slightly less more?

Agent: I realize that's still an increase from your original promotional rate, yes. But what I can also do is check to see if there are any other plans or promotions that might be a better fit for your needs. Are you currently using the Fiber 300 plan? That's 300 megabits per second download speeds?

Customer: I mean, I guess? I don't really know. I just use it for browsing and streaming Netflix and stuff. I don't need crazy fast internet or anything.

Agent: Okay, perfect. So actually, we might be able to move you to our Fiber 100 plan, which is still great for streaming and web browsing. That plan is currently available at $79.99 for the first year. That would actually save you about ten dollars a month compared to your old promotional rate.

Customer: Really? And it would work just fine for Netflix?

Agent: Absolutely. Fiber 100 gives you 100 megabits per second, which is more than enough for multiple devices streaming at the same time. You'd have no issues with Netflix or regular browsing.

Customer: Okay, that sounds... that sounds better, honestly. But it's still just another promotional rate though, right? So this is just going to happen all over again in a year?

Agent: (pause) That's a fair point. The Fiber 100 plan does come with our current promotional offer, yes. After the year is up, it would go to $94.99. But the way I like to look at it is you'd be saving money for the next year, and then when that promotion ends, you can always give us a call and we can look at what offers are available at that time. Promotions change pretty frequently, so there might be something new available for you then.

Customer: (sighs) I mean, I guess that's... I don't know. This whole thing just feels kind of shady to me, you know? Like, why can't you guys just tell people upfront that the price is going to go up? Why do you have to bury it in the terms and conditions or whatever?

Agent: You know, I hear that feedback pretty often, and I completely understand your frustration. I'm sorry that this isn't clearer in how we communicate with customers. But I do want to help make this right for you. If you want to switch to the Fiber 100 plan, I can process that for you right now and get you set up at that lower rate. You'd see the change on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay... yeah, let's do that. Let's switch to the Fiber 100 plan.

Agent: Great, I'm going to process that change for you now. (typing sounds) I'll just need to confirm a couple of things. Your service address is still 422 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you understand that you'll be on the Fiber 100 plan at $79.99 per month for the first twelve months, and after that promotional period ends, the rate will be $94.99 per month?

Customer: Yeah, I got it. I'll probably call before it expires and see if there's something better available.

Agent: That's a smart idea. (typing sounds) Okay, all set. I've processed the plan change for you. You should see this reflected on your next bill, which will be... (pause) coming on the 15th of next month. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. I appreciate your patience, and I'm sorry again about the confusion with the rate increase. If you have any other issues or questions, please don't hesitate to give us a call back. Is there a preferred number to reach you at?

Customer: The number you already have on file is fine.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
