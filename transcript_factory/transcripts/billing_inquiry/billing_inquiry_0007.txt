Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm really confused about a charge. I've been with Frontier for about three years now, and my bill just jumped up like thirty dollars. I need to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your charges. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... All right, I've got your account. I can see you're on our Gigabit fiber plan in the Springfield area. Can you tell me what your bill was running before, and what it is now?

Customer: Well, it was one hundred and nineteen ninety-five, and this month it came in at one hundred and forty-nine ninety-five. That's thirty bucks more. And I didn't authorize any changes or anything.

Agent: (pause) I understand, that would definitely be surprising. Let me take a look at what happened here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that on the twenty-third of last month, there was a promotional rate that expired on your account.

Customer: Wait, what? A promotional rate? I didn't even know I was on a promotional rate. I thought that was my regular price.

Agent: Yeah, I can see how that would be confusing. It looks like when your account was set up, you were enrolled in our first-year promotional pricing, which gave you a discount of thirty dollars per month. That promotion ended after twelve billing cycles, and your rate adjusted to our standard pricing for the Gigabit fiber service.

Customer: Okay, but... I mean, nobody told me about that. I didn't get any notification or anything.

Agent: Let me check the notes on your account here. (typing sounds) I can see that a notification was sent to the email on file approximately forty-five days before the change took effect. Do you have access to the email address... it looks like it ends in "...@gmail.com"?

Customer: Oh, um, I barely check that email. I set that up forever ago. Why wouldn't you guys send me something in the mail or... I don't know, include it with the bill?

Agent: That's a fair point. We do send notifications to the primary contact email, and we also include information in the billing documents. But I completely understand that email can get missed. (pause) Here's what I can do for you. I can see we have a few options. One, I can provide you with information about some of our other service tiers that might be more budget-friendly. Or, I can see if there's anything we can do about your current rate.

Customer: Well, I don't want to downgrade. I have three roommates and we're always streaming and working from home. The Gigabit is what we need. Can't you just... I mean, can you offer me any kind of discount or credit?

Agent: (pause) I appreciate you asking. Unfortunately, promotional rates are really a one-time offer when you first sign up. However, I do have some flexibility here. Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) What I can offer you is a loyalty credit of fifteen dollars per month for the next six months. That would bring your bill down to one thirty-four ninety-five, so it's not quite back to where it was, but it does help bridge that gap.

Customer: Fifteen dollars? So I'd still be paying fifteen more than I was before?

Agent: Right, so with the loyalty credit, the difference would be fifteen dollars, yes. I know that's... that's not ideal. The standard rate for our Gigabit fiber in your area is the one forty-nine ninety-five. The credit does help offset some of the increase, and after six months, if you want to discuss any other options, we can definitely look at that time.

Customer: (sighs) Can I ask why the promotional price was so much lower? Like, are you guys charging more for the same service, or...?

Agent: That's a good question. The promotional pricing is designed to help new customers get started with Frontier, and it's typically about thirty percent off our standard rate. After that initial period, the price adjusts to our regular pricing for that service level. I know it can feel like a sudden jump, but you are getting the same high-speed service you've been enjoying.

Customer: (pause) Look, I appreciate you trying to help here. Can I think about this? I'd like to shop around and see what other providers are offering in my area before I decide to keep paying this much.

Agent: Absolutely, that makes total sense. You should definitely compare options. Can I just mention that we also have our triple play bundle if you're interested in bundling internet, TV, and phone service? That sometimes brings the overall cost down.

Customer: I just have internet with you guys. I don't really need TV.

Agent: Understood. Well, if you do decide you want to move forward with that loyalty credit, or if you want to discuss anything else after you've looked around, just give us a call back. The offer is good for, let me see here... (typing) it's good for the next thirty days.

Customer: Okay. So my account number is 555-0147, right? Should I reference that if I call back?

Agent: Yes, exactly. That or the phone number associated with the account works too. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for explaining things, anyway. I just wish I had been more aware that the price was going to change.

Agent: I totally understand your frustration, and I'm sorry we couldn't have made that clearer upfront. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer for the past three years, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns.

Customer: All right, I appreciate it. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great day.
