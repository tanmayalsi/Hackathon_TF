Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. My bill went up like thirty dollars out of nowhere and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this account under the name Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your bill now. I see that your current balance is $127.99. Can you tell me what you were paying before, or what you expected to be charged?

Customer: It was ninety-eight dollars. For the last like... I don't know, two years maybe? It's been a steady ninety-eight a month. And now suddenly it's one-twenty-eight. That's, that's not right. Did you guys raise the rates or something?

Agent: I understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. Let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing here that your promotional rate expired about a month ago. You had a twelve-month introductory offer at $98 per month for our Fiber 200 package. That promotion ended, and now you're being charged the standard rate of $127.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. I didn't... I didn't know about any promotional rate. I mean, I knew the price but I didn't realize it was just temporary. Nobody told me it was gonna go up.

Agent: I apologize for the confusion there. When you first signed up, the promotional terms should have been included in your welcome materials and explained during signup. However, I completely understand that these things can sometimes be missed. Let me see what options I have available for you.

Customer: Okay, well, I mean, that's frustrating. Is there anything you can do? I'm on a fixed income and an extra thirty bucks a month is... it adds up, you know?

Agent: Absolutely, I hear you. Let me check what promotions we currently have available. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I do have some options for you. We have a current promotion that would bring your rate back down. We can offer you the same Fiber 200 package at $109.99 per month for the next twelve months. That would be a nice savings compared to what you're being charged now.

Customer: Okay, so that's still more than the ninety-eight I was paying, but I guess it's better than one-twenty-eight. How long would that be locked in for?

Agent: This would be locked in for twelve months at $109.99. After that year is up, the rate would go back to the standard rate unless we have another promotion available at that time.

Customer: (sighs) So I'm gonna have this same problem again in a year?

Agent: That's possible, yes. However, many of our customers call back at that time, and we're often able to find them a promotion to keep their rate competitive. But I can absolutely make a note on your account that you'd like us to reach out to you before your promotion expires so we can discuss your options.

Customer: Okay, yeah, please do that. I'd appreciate that. So what do I need to do to get this promotion applied?

Agent: You don't need to do anything. I can apply this right now for you. (typing sounds) Let me just get some confirmation from you first. You want to continue with the Fiber 200 package, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's fine. I use it for email and streaming mostly. Works great for that.

Agent: Perfect. And you want the twelve-month rate of $109.99 per month?

Customer: Yes.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, I'm applying that promotion now. And I'm also adding a note to your account requesting that we contact you thirty days before your promotion ends so we can discuss your options at that time. Your new rate will be effective on your next billing cycle, which is... (pause) looks like that would be next Tuesday.

Customer: Okay, so I'll see this reflected on my next bill?

Agent: Yes, that's right. Your next bill should show the new rate of $109.99. You'll receive that bill next Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on how quickly it processes.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. Um, one more thing—why wasn't I notified before my rate went up? Like, shouldn't you guys have sent me something saying my promotion was ending?

Agent: That's a really fair question, Mr. Chen. We do send notifications typically around the time a promotion is about to expire. I'm checking here... (pause) It looks like we may have sent a notification to the email address on file, which is [inaudible]. Is that still a current email for you?

Customer: Oh, um, that's actually an old email. I don't check that one anymore. I probably should have updated it.

Agent: Ah, okay. Well, that would explain why you didn't receive the notice. I can definitely update that for you right now if you'd like. What's the best email address to use for your account going forward?

Customer: It's r-o-b-e-r-t dot chen at gmail dot com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I've updated that in your account. And again, I'm making sure that we'll contact you before your next promotion expires.

Customer: Okay, great. Thanks for helping me out with this.

Agent: You're very welcome, Mr. Chen. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. You guys should probably do a better job of letting people know about these rate changes though, just saying.

Agent: You know what, I really appreciate that feedback. I'm gonna pass that along to our customer service management team. Is there a preferred way for us to contact you about your promotion renewal? Phone call, email, text message?

Customer: Email is fine, as long as it's to the right address now.

Agent: Perfect. I've made a note of that. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I apologize again for the confusion with your bill. We really do appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.
