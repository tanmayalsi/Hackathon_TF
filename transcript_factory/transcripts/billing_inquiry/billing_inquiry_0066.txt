Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged... I think there's an error. My bill went up like thirty dollars out of nowhere, and I don't understand why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing an issue with your bill. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's the number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I also get your name, please?

Customer: It's Patricia. Patricia Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, Patricia. Thank you. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account now. I can see your most recent bill is from... looks like it was issued on the 15th. Is that the one you're concerned about?

Customer: Yes, that one. Last month it was like $89, and this month it's $119. That's almost a thirty dollar jump. I haven't added any services or anything, so I don't know what's going on.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you have our Fiber 500 internet plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, the 500 speed plan. I've had that for... I don't know, maybe two years now?

Agent: Great. So looking at your account, I can see that your promotional rate expired. You were on a promotional pricing of $79 per month, and that promotion ended on the 14th of this month, so your new standard rate is $109 per month. That's why you're seeing the increase.

Customer: (frustrated) Wait, wait. Nobody told me about this. I never got any notification or anything. You can't just... I mean, that's a huge jump. I feel like there should have been some kind of warning.

Agent: I absolutely hear you, and I'm sorry you didn't receive notification. Let me check our records here... (pause, typing sounds) It looks like we did send out a notice about the promotion ending, but I understand that doesn't help if you didn't see it. That's frustrating.

Customer: So what are my options here? Because I'm not paying $120 a month for internet. That's too much.

Agent: I totally get that. Let me see what I can do for you. (pause) One option is, I can look at our current promotional offers. We actually do have some competitive packages available right now. Let me see what I can find...

Customer: Like what? I mean, I've been a loyal customer. I just want a fair price.

Agent: That's completely fair. So right now, we're running a promotion where we can get you back on a promotional rate of $89 per month for another 12 months. After that, it would go back to the standard rate, but at least that locks you in at that price for the next year. Would that be something you'd be interested in?

Customer: (hesitant) Okay, so... I'd be back to what I'm paying now? For a year?

Agent: Yes, exactly. For the next 12 months, you'd be at $89, just like your promotional rate was. And honestly, that's the best offer I can get for you in your area right now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I mean... that works for me. But this should've been communicated better. I shouldn't have to call in to find out my rate went up.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize for that. I'm going to make a note on your account about the lack of notification. Is there anything else I can help clarify?

Customer: No, I think that's... yeah, that's good. So when does the new rate take effect?

Agent: The promotional rate will be applied to your next billing cycle, which would be starting on the 15th of next month. So your next bill should reflect that $89 rate. You should see it within the next few days after your billing date.

Customer: [inaudible] Okay, good. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome, Patricia. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all I needed.

Agent: Alright, well thank you so much for calling Frontier, and I really do apologize again for the confusion with the rate change. We appreciate your business, and we'll see you next month with that updated rate.

Customer: Okay, thank you. Bye.

Agent: Thank you, and have a great day!
