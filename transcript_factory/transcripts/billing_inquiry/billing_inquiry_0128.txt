Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like thirty dollars from last month and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having billing concerns. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Torres.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, Michael. I've got your account here. I'm seeing your last bill was $89.99 and your current bill is $119.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. That's like a thirty dollar jump. What happened? I've been with Frontier for three years and I've never had a price increase like this.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me take a closer look at what's on your current bill. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at the charges here. You have your standard Fiber 300 plan at $59.99, which is your internet service...

Customer: Wait, hold on. My plan was $59.99 last month too, right?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. The internet service hasn't changed. But I'm also seeing a premium channel package that's showing up on this bill for $39.99. Was that recently added to your account?

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, so I might've ordered like HBO or something last month during a free trial, but I thought that was supposed to be free for three months. I didn't authorize a charge yet.

Agent: Ah, okay. So you did sign up for a promotional offer. Let me look at the details of that. (typing sounds) I'm seeing here that you activated the HBO Max add-on on December 15th, and yes, there was a three-month promotional period. However, that promotion has ended, so the $39.99 monthly charge has started.

Customer: But that doesn't make sense because... I mean, I got it on the 15th, so three months would be... that would be mid-March. It's only January 20th right now.

Agent: (pause) Let me verify those dates for you. (typing sounds) You know what, you're absolutely right. I apologize. The three-month promotional period should run through mid-March, so this charge shouldn't have been applied yet. That's an error on our end.

Customer: So can you remove it? Or credit it back to my account?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to credit that $39.99 charge back to your account right now. (typing sounds) And I'm going to make a note here to ensure that the promotional period is correctly applied through March 15th, at which time the charge will begin.

Customer: Okay, good. But what about the other charge? There's also like a $20 charge I don't recognize on here.

Agent: Let me look at that. (typing sounds) I'm seeing a modem rental fee of $19.99. Have you been getting a modem from us, or do you have your own equipment?

Customer: Wait, what? I've been paying for a modem this whole time?

Agent: It looks like based on your account, yes. You've been on a modem rental for the duration of your service. Most customers don't realize that's on their bill because it's bundled with the internet charge, but it breaks out here separately. Did you... did you not know about that charge?

Customer: No, I didn't! Why wasn't I told about this? That's ridiculous.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I apologize that this wasn't made clear to you. What we can do is, if you'd like to purchase a modem outright, that's typically a one-time cost of around $99 to $149 depending on the model, and then you wouldn't have that monthly rental fee anymore.

Customer: (pause) So I can just... buy one?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. You can purchase a compatible modem, and we'll provision it on your account. Or, if you prefer, you can return the modem you have and purchase one separately from another retailer. Would you like me to go over some purchasing options for you?

Customer: ...Yeah, actually, can you just email me some information about that? Because I'm still kind of upset that I've been paying $20 a month for something I didn't even know about.

Agent: I completely understand. I'll email you some modem options, and I'll also include a summary of the credits I've applied today. But I do want to acknowledge that—honestly, the modem fee should have been explained to you upfront when you signed up. That's on us. I'm going to add an additional $19.99 credit to your account for this month as a gesture of goodwill, and you can take some time to decide if you want to purchase a modem or continue with the rental.

Customer: Really? Okay, well... I appreciate that, actually. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. So to recap what I've done here: I've credited back the HBO Max charge of $39.99 since the promotional period is still active. I've added an additional credit of $19.99 for the modem fee this month, and I'm sending you information about modem purchase options. Your account should show those credits within the next 24 hours.

Customer: Great. And just to be clear, after this month, if I don't buy a modem, the modem fee is going to start showing up again, right?

Agent: That's correct. Unless you purchase a modem or decide to cancel the rental service. But I'd definitely recommend looking at those options I send you because over time, purchasing one is usually more cost-effective.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I'll take a look. Um, is there anything else I should know about my bill?

Agent: (pause) Let me just do a quick scan here... (typing sounds) No, everything else looks standard. You're all set. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for your help, Derek.

Agent: My pleasure, Michael. And again, I apologize for the confusion on the modem charge and the HBO Max billing. We appreciate your business, and if you have any other questions when you get that email, feel free to reach out.

Customer: Will do. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!
