Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually I recognize it, but I'm pretty sure I'm being overcharged.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Alright, I've got your account. I'm showing it's under the name... Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned a charge that concerns you. Can you tell me which charge we're looking at, and approximately how much it is?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill went from like $89.99 to $124.99. That's a $35 increase! I don't remember authorizing any upgrade or anything. I've just had the basic 300 Mbps plan this whole time.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. Let me see what might have changed here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your account history. It appears that on March 15th, your plan was automatically upgraded to our 500 Mbps fiber plan.

Customer: Automatically? I didn't request that. Why would it automatically upgrade? That doesn't make sense.

Agent: That's a great question, and I understand why that would be confusing. Looking at your notes here, it shows that you were on a promotional rate that expired. When promotional rates end, customers are typically transitioned to the standard pricing for their current plan tier, or sometimes—

Customer: (interrupting) No, no, no. Wait. I've been with Frontier for like three years. You're telling me my promotional rate just expired and nobody told me?

Agent: I apologize, Mr. Chen. Let me look at what communications were sent out. (pause) (typing sounds) It looks like we did send you an email on March 8th notifying you of the upcoming rate change, but I understand that's not always easy to catch.

Customer: I get like a hundred emails a day. I don't remember seeing that. But that still doesn't explain the automatic upgrade. Why did my plan change tiers?

Agent: That's actually a separate issue. Let me clarify—your plan didn't necessarily change tiers automatically. What may have happened is... (pause) okay, I'm seeing here that there was a promotion bundled with your original plan. When that promotion ended, the system may have adjusted your billing. But I'm also seeing that you do have the 500 Mbps plan now, which is different from the 300 Mbps plan you mentioned.

Customer: So you're saying I got upgraded without asking?

Agent: I apologize for the confusion. Let me look into this more carefully. (typing sounds) (longer pause) Mr. Chen, I want to make sure I give you accurate information. Can you hold for just one moment while I check with my supervisor on this account?

Customer: Ugh, okay. How long is this going to take?

Agent: Should be just a couple minutes. Thank you for holding.

Customer: Yeah, fine.

(hold music plays)

Agent: (returning) Thank you for holding, Mr. Chen. I appreciate your patience. So I've reviewed your account with my supervisor, and here's what we found. You were on a three-year promotional rate that began when you signed up. That rate was $54.99 for the 300 Mbps plan. That promotion expired on March 15th.

Customer: Right, and then what?

Agent: Standard pricing for that plan would be $89.99, which is what you were paying before. However, I do see that your equipment may have needed to be refreshed, and it's possible there was a configuration change on our end that may have resulted in the plan adjustment. I sincerely apologize for the lack of clarity on this.

Customer: So can you just put me back on the 300 Mbps plan and back to my old price?

Agent: The promotional rate unfortunately cannot be reinstated as it was tied to your initial service agreement. However, what I can do is offer you an alternative. We do have a current promotion running through the end of the month—$69.99 for the 300 Mbps plan for the first 12 months. Or, if you've been happy with the speeds, we could keep you on the 500 Mbps plan at $99.99 per month instead of $124.99.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. So the $99.99 option—that's still $10 more than I was paying.

Agent: That's correct. Your promotional rate was $54.99, so yes, there would be an increase. But that would be $25 less than your current bill.

Customer: What if I take the 300 Mbps promo? Will that stay at $69.99 for the whole year?

Agent: Yes, exactly. For 12 months it would be $69.99 for the 300 Mbps plan, and then after that year it would go to the standard rate, which is currently $89.99.

Customer: And you'd need to downgrade my service back to that speed?

Agent: Yes, we would need to provision that change, but it's a fairly quick process. You shouldn't experience any downtime, and we could have that updated within 24 hours typically.

Customer: Alright, I'll do that. But I'm not happy about this. I wish you guys would've been clearer about the promotional rate expiring.

Agent: I completely understand, Mr. Chen, and I sincerely apologize for the confusion around that. I will add a note to your account about your concerns, and I can also credit you $35 for this billing cycle to help make up for the frustration—that would cover the difference between what you were paying and the overage.

Customer: (pause) Really? You can do that?

Agent: Yes, I can apply that as a one-time courtesy credit. So your bill for this month would be approximately $34.99, and then going forward it would be $69.99 for the next 12 months.

Customer: Okay, yeah. That's fair. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Let me go ahead and make those changes for you now. (typing sounds) Just to confirm—you want to downgrade to the 300 Mbps plan at the promotional rate of $69.99 per month for 12 months, and I'm applying a $35 credit to your current bill. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) (more typing) Alright, those changes have been applied. You should see the updated plan reflected on your next bill. And the credit should appear within 24 to 48 hours. You'll get an email confirmation of these changes as well.

Customer: Great, I appreciate that.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for taking care of this.

Agent: Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, Mr. Chen. We really appreciate your business, and again, I apologize for the confusion on the billing. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye!
