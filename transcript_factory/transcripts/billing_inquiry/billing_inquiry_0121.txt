# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually, I recognize it, but it shouldn't be there. My bill went up like thirty dollars and nobody told me about it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing billing concerns. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... hold on. (rustling sounds) Okay, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And what's the best name to have on file?

Customer: James. James Morrison.

Agent: Great, James. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your account now. I can see your most recent bill from March 15th. Can you tell me which charge you're concerned about?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill was usually like, I don't know, around ninety-eight bucks a month for, you know, the fiber internet and the basic TV package. This month it's showing $127.99. That's like... that's almost thirty dollars more. I didn't authorize any of that.

Agent: I understand your frustration, James. Let me take a look at the itemization here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing your standard Fiber 200 internet plan at $79.99, which is your regular rate. And then the TV package at $39.99. But I'm also seeing a charge here for $9.99 for HBO Max premium add-on. Is that something you added?

Customer: No. No, I definitely didn't add HBO Max. I don't even watch that stuff. Why would I add something I didn't ask for?

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Let me check your account notes here. (pause) Okay, so it looks like there was an auto-enrollment that happened back in February. Sometimes when customers update their account information or make a payment adjustment, the system can auto-populate promotional add-ons. It looks like that may have happened in your case.

Customer: Wait, I didn't update anything. I just pay my bill online every month. And if it was a promotional add-on, shouldn't that have been free or something?

Agent: That's a great question, and you're right to call that out. The initial promotional period for that add-on was actually three months free. Looking at your account, it appears that promotion was applied, but you weren't notified when it was about to expire. That's our mistake. I'm going to go ahead and remove that charge from your account, and I'll also apply a credit for the current month since you weren't informed of the expiration.

Customer: (pause) Oh. Well, okay. I mean, I appreciate that, but... can you like, make sure this doesn't happen again? I don't have time to call and dispute every charge.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to make a note on your account right now to disable any auto-enrollment settings. (typing sounds) And I'm also going to send you an email confirmation of this adjustment so you have it for your records. Going forward, if there's ever an add-on or promotion, we'll make sure to notify you 30 days before any charges apply. How does that sound?

Customer: Okay, yeah, that's... that's better. So my bill should go back down to what it was?

Agent: Yes, sir. Your next bill should show $89.98, which is your standard internet and TV package. And just to confirm, you'll see a credit of $9.99 applied to your current bill, bringing your March statement down to approximately $118 instead of $127.99.

Customer: Alright, that's fair. Um, one more thing though. Is there any chance my internet price is going to go up again? Because I remember you guys had a price increase a couple years ago and I feel like it keeps creeping up.

Agent: (pause) That's... that's a valid concern, James. I'm not aware of any upcoming rate changes at this moment, but I will say that pricing can be subject to change. However, what I can do is check if there are any current promotional rates we're offering for existing customers like yourself. Let me take a quick look. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that we do have a loyalty promotion available right now for customers who've been with us for more than two years. That would lock in your current rate for another 12 months with no increases. Would you be interested in that?

Customer: Wait, really? How come you didn't mention that before?

Agent: I apologize for not bringing that up sooner. I should have offered that as part of our conversation. Would you like me to go ahead and apply that to your account?

Customer: Yeah, definitely. I mean, that would be one less thing to worry about. And it locks it in for a whole year?

Agent: Yes, for a full 12 months. After that, your rate would be subject to change, but we'll send you a notification at least 30 days before any adjustment. (typing sounds) Perfect. I've applied that promotion to your account as well. You should receive an email confirmation within the next hour with all the details.

Customer: Great. So to recap... you're removing the HBO thing, giving me a credit, and locking in my rate?

Agent: That's exactly right, James. And I've also disabled the auto-enrollment settings and added a note to your account. You should see everything reflected on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, that's... that's good. I appreciate that, Derek. I was kind of frustrated when I called in, but you know, this actually worked out.

Agent: I'm really glad I could help, James. And again, I apologize for the inconvenience with the auto-enrollment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for being a valued Frontier customer, James. Have a great day, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye. (call ends)
