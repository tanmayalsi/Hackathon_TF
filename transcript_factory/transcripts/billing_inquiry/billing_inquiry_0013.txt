Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my monthly rate went up. I've been a customer for like three years and nobody told me about this increase.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing some billing concerns. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147... Perfect, I have your account right here. I see your service address is on Maple Street in Bozeman, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned a charge you don't recognize and a rate increase. Let me pull up your recent billing statement here. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. What specific charge are you seeing that seems unfamiliar?

Customer: There's... um... it's called like "Professional Installation Fee" or something? It's for $89.99. I didn't request any installation. My service has been working fine for months.

Agent: Okay, I see that charge. Let me just pull up the details here. (typing sounds) Hmm, that's odd. Can you tell me what date that charge appeared on your bill?

Customer: It's on this bill, which I think is... it says April 1st through April 30th. So it showed up this month.

Agent: (pause) I see it here. That does seem unusual if you didn't request any service visit. Let me check the notes on your account to see if there was... (pause) Ah, okay, I'm seeing something here. Were you having any issues with your internet connection around late March? Anything intermittent or not working properly?

Customer: No, actually, everything's been great. I mean, that's why I'm confused. The internet's been working perfectly.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. You know what, this might be a billing error on our end. I don't see any corresponding service appointment in your record. I'm going to make a note here that we need to investigate this charge, and I'm absolutely going to remove it from your account today. You shouldn't have been charged for that.

Customer: Oh, okay. Well, that's good. But what about the rate increase? That's actually my bigger concern. I've been loyal to Frontier for three years, and it feels like you guys just keep raising prices without notice.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me look at your service plan here. (typing sounds) Okay, so you're on our Fiber 500 plan, and I'm seeing that your rate did increase from $79.99 to $94.99 effective April 1st. Is that the increase you're referring to?

Customer: Yeah, that's it. Fifteen dollars a month more? That's basically $180 a year! And like I said, I got no notice about this until I saw the bill.

Agent: (pause) That's a substantial increase, and I hear your concern. Let me explain what happened here. We did send out a notice approximately 30 days before the rate change took effect, as required by our terms of service. However, I completely understand that notifications can sometimes get missed or go to spam. (typing sounds) Let me see what options I can offer you here.

Customer: I didn't get any notice. I check my email regularly, and I didn't see anything from Frontier.

Agent: I believe you. Sometimes these things do slip through the cracks. Let me pull up what we have on file. We show it was mailed to your service address on March 1st, and it was also emailed to the address we have for you, which is... [inaudible] ...@gmail.com. Does that match your email address?

Customer: Oh, that one? I hardly ever check that email. That's my old one. I should've updated it. But... I mean, still, shouldn't you guys be more transparent about rate increases?

Agent: That's fair feedback, and I do appreciate you saying that. You know, I can't control our company's pricing policy, but what I can do is see if there are any promotional offerings available for loyal, long-term customers like yourself. Let me check our current promotions. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so unfortunately, the standard promotions that we're running right now are for new customers only. However, let me see if I can speak with my supervisor about potentially reducing your rate for a limited time as a gesture of goodwill.

Customer: That would be great. I mean, I like the service, I really do. It's fast. But I'm not trying to be taken advantage of either, you know?

Agent: I totally get it, and I appreciate your loyalty. Let me just put you on a brief hold while I check with my supervisor. It'll just be a couple of minutes, okay?

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (hold music, about 90 seconds) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I was able to work with my supervisor, and here's what we can do for you. We can honor your previous rate of $79.99 for the next 12 months, and then after that, the standard rate will apply. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Really? For a whole year?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I'm going to apply that as a loyalty credit starting with your next billing cycle, so you should see that reflected next month. And again, I've already removed that $89.99 installation charge from your current bill.

Customer: Wow, okay. Yeah, that definitely helps. I appreciate that, Derek. I was ready to cancel, to be honest.

Agent: I'm so glad we could work this out. I definitely don't want to lose you as a customer. We value your business. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I feel much better about this now.

Agent: Excellent. Just to recap what we've done today: I've removed the disputed installation fee of $89.99 from your current bill, and I've applied a loyalty rate of $79.99 for the next 12 months on your Fiber 500 plan. You should see those adjustments reflected on your next bill. And I'm going to send you an email confirmation of everything we discussed today.

Customer: Great. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. And hey, I'd encourage you to update that email address in your account so you get all our future communications. You can do that online, or I can help you with that right now if you'd like?

Customer: I'll do it online. That's easier.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Thanks again.

Agent: Bye now.
