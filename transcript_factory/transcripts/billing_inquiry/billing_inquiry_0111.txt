# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged... I think there's been a mistake or something. My bill went up like thirty dollars this month and I want to know why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your bill. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's the number you're calling me on right now, actually. Five-five-five, zero-two-seven-three.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. Let me pull that up here. (pause) And can I get the name on the account, please?

Customer: It's James. James Morrow.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, James, I've got your account here. So you're saying your bill increased this month?

Customer: Yeah, it definitely did. Last month I paid... I think it was like ninety-nine dollars, and this month the bill came through at one-twenty-eight. That's almost thirty bucks more for no reason that I can see.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I see your account. So looking at your current plan, you have our Fiber 500 plan with our TV package, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've had that for like two years now, so I don't understand why it would suddenly jump up like that.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at what might have changed here. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that you had a promotional rate on your account that expired. You were on a special offer rate of ninety-nine ninety-nine a month for twelve months, and that promotion ended at the end of last month.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about that. I mean... (pause) ...when I signed up, they said that was the rate. I didn't know it was going to go up after a year.

Agent: I completely understand. I apologize for that not being made clear when you set up your service. The standard rate for our Fiber 500 with TV package is one hundred twenty-eight ninety-nine, which is what you're seeing on your current bill. So the increase you're experiencing is because that promotional period has ended.

Customer: But that doesn't seem right. I mean, I signed up for a service and a price, and now you're just... raising it? I'm a loyal customer. I've been paying on time, haven't had any issues.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I really do appreciate your loyalty, James. (pause) What I can do for you is look at what promotional offers we currently have available. We do have some options for existing customers. Let me see what I can offer you here.

Customer: Okay, well... what kind of options are we talking about?

Agent: (typing sounds) So I'm looking at your history and your account standing, which is excellent, by the way. We have a current promotion for our valued customers where I can reduce your rate for the next six months. I could bring you down to one hundred nine ninety-nine for the next six months on that same Fiber 500 with TV package.

Customer: (pause) So that's like twenty dollars less than what I'm paying now?

Agent: Yes, exactly. That would save you about nineteen dollars per month for the next six months.

Customer: Right, but then what happens after six months? It's just going to go back up again to the one-twenty-eight?

Agent: That's a fair question. After the six-month promotional period, it would return to our standard rate, yes. However, we can look at adjusting your plan closer to that time if you'd like. You could also consider downgrading to just internet service if you wanted to reduce your overall bill, though I know you do utilize the TV package.

Customer: (sighs) I don't really want to downgrade. I use the TV service. It's just frustrating that I wasn't contacted about this before my bill suddenly jumped. Why can't you just keep my rate where it was?

Agent: I hear you. I wish I had the ability to grandfather in that promotional rate indefinitely, but unfortunately, promotional periods do have end dates in our system. What I can do is apply this six-month rate reduction effective immediately, and then closer to when that promotion ends, you can give us a call back and we can review options again at that time. We may have new promotions available then as well.

Customer: (long pause) So the best you can do is knock off some money for six months?

Agent: I understand your frustration, James, and I apologize again that you weren't proactively notified about the promotional period ending. What I'm offering is a discount that should help ease that increase for half a year, and I want to be honest with you—that's the most I can do for you today. But I do encourage you to reach out again before that six-month period ends so we can explore other options that might be available to you at that time.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I guess... I guess I can accept that. Can you make sure that this discount is actually applied? I don't want to see the full amount next month.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to put this promotional offer on your account right now. (typing sounds) And this will take effect on your next billing cycle, which should be... let me see... next Thursday. So you should see that one hundred nine ninety-nine charge on your next bill.

Customer: Okay. And you said to call back in six months?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Or even a month before it expires would be good, so we have plenty of time to review what options are available to you at that point.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. Thanks for helping me out.

Agent: Of course, James. I really do apologize for the inconvenience with the lack of notification on this. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
