# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I was charged like... (pause) ...let me look at this again... I was charged $89.99 for something called "Premium Service Upgrade," and I never authorized that.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you look into that right away. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's area code 206, so 206-555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. One moment... (pause) Alright, I've got your account here under the name... Michael Torres?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm looking at your bill for this month, and I do see that charge for $89.99 for the Premium Service Upgrade. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this?

Customer: Well, I just got the bill yesterday. I looked it over and I don't remember ever agreeing to that. I mean, I've been with Frontier for, what, three years now? And my bill's always been $59.99 a month. Now suddenly it's almost $150, and I have no idea why.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account history here to see what happened. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that the Premium Service Upgrade was added to your account on... March 15th of this month. Do you recall speaking with anyone from Frontier around that time?

Customer: March 15th? Um... (hesitation) ...no, I don't think so. I mean, I might've gotten a call, but I don't remember agreeing to anything. If I did pick up, I probably would've hung up immediately. You know how it is with telemarketing calls.

Agent: That makes sense. Let me look at the notes here to see if there's any context about why this was added. (typing sounds) Hmm, it's showing here that it was added as a promotional offer, but there's not a lot of detail about how that was sold to you. Were you perhaps offered a promotional deal when someone called, or did you access something online?

Customer: I really don't remember getting any call about this. I check my emails too, and I don't see anything about it. That's why I'm confused. Did one of your sales people just add it without asking?

Agent: That would definitely be frustrating if that's what happened. I apologize for that. The good news is that I can absolutely look into removing this charge for you. Before I do that, though, let me just ask—have you noticed any actual difference in your service since March 15th? The Premium Service Upgrade typically adds some features like priority customer support and faster speeds.

Customer: No, I haven't noticed anything different at all. My speed's been the same, everything's been the same. So no, I don't want to pay for something I'm not using and didn't agree to.

Agent: That's totally fair. I don't blame you. Let me go ahead and remove this charge from your account right now. (typing sounds) And I'm also going to flag this so that we can look into how this was added in the first place.

Customer: Okay, thank you. But like, I just want to understand—is this a one-time charge removal, or is my bill going to go back to normal going forward?

Agent: Great question. So what I'm doing is removing the $89.99 charge from this month's bill. Going forward, unless we add anything else, your bill should go back to your regular $59.99. However, I do want to make sure we catch what happened here. (pause) I'm also going to credit you $15 as a courtesy for the inconvenience of having to call in about this.

Customer: (pause) Okay, well... I appreciate that. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Now, I'm also going to make a note on your account that you did not authorize this upgrade, so if anyone from our sales team reaches out to you, they'll see that. Just to double-check everything, what email address do you have on file?

Customer: It's m-torres-2847 at gmail dot com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And I'm going to send you an email confirmation of the removal of this charge and the credit we've applied. You should receive that within the next hour or so.

Customer: Okay, good. And what's my new balance going to be then?

Agent: (typing sounds) So your previous balance on this month's bill was $149.98. With the removal of the $89.99 charge and the $15 courtesy credit, your new total will be $44.99.

Customer: Wait, so my balance is only $44.99 now?

Agent: That's correct. So you're actually getting a credit on top of the removal because of the courtesy adjustment I applied.

Customer: (pause) Oh wow, okay. Yeah, that's... that's good then. I appreciate that, Derek.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I'm glad we got this straightened out.

Agent: Excellent. Well, thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, Michael. We really appreciate your business, and again, I apologize for the confusion with that charge. Have a great day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Thank you. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
