# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually, I do recognize it, but it wasn't supposed to be there.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I just confirm the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got your account open. So you mentioned there's a charge you're disputing. Can you tell me which charge that is and roughly how much?

Customer: Yeah, so my internet has been running me $79.99 a month, which I was fine with. But this month the bill came through at $109.99. That's a thirty-dollar increase, and nobody told me about this. I didn't authorize any upgrade or anything.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, David. A thirty-dollar jump is definitely significant. Let me take a look at what's on your account here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing that on the 15th of last month, there was a rate adjustment applied to your account.

Customer: A rate adjustment? What does that mean? I never agreed to that.

Agent: That's a great question. So looking at the notes here, it appears... hmm. (pause) Let me check something. What plan were you originally on when you signed up?

Customer: I don't... I think it was the 300 megabit plan? I've had the service for like three years now, I think.

Agent: Okay, so you've been with us for three years on the 300 meg plan at $79.99. And according to my notes, it looks like you were on a promotional rate that expired. (pause) That promotional period was originally set to end three years from your installation date, which would have been last month.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me that I've been getting a promotional rate this whole time and nobody warned me? I should have gotten some kind of notice before you just jacked up my bill.

Agent: That's... that's a really fair point, David. And I apologize that you didn't receive advance notification about that. That should have happened. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) Can I ask—have you had any service issues or problems with your connection in the past few months?

Customer: No, actually the service has been pretty good. It's reliable. I don't have any complaints about the actual internet. I just... I feel blindsided by this price increase, you know?

Agent: I hear you. Well, the good news is that I can potentially help you out here. Since you've been a loyal customer for three years and you should have received a courtesy notice about the rate change, I have some options. I can look into putting you on another promotional offer that we have available right now.

Customer: Another promotional offer? How long would that last?

Agent: So we have a twelve-month promotion right now that would bring you down to $84.99 per month for the same 300 megabit service. That's a savings of twenty-five dollars a month compared to what your current bill would be.

Customer: $84.99... so that's more than the original $79.99 I was paying, but less than the $109.99 that just hit my account?

Agent: That's correct, yes. And after the twelve months, the rate would adjust to our standard rate, which... (pause) let me just check what that would be. (typing sounds) It looks like the standard rate for that plan is $99.99 per month.

Customer: Okay, so basically I'm going to end up paying more eventually no matter what.

Agent: I understand why you feel that way. The promotions do have end dates, and rates do adjust. But I can definitely help minimize that impact. What I can also do is, since this rate increase should have been communicated to you in advance and it wasn't, I can credit your account for the overage this month. So that $30 difference between your old promotional rate and what you were just charged—I can put that back on your account as a courtesy credit.

Customer: (pause) Really? You can do that?

Agent: Yes, I can. And then I can apply the twelve-month promotional rate starting with your next billing cycle. So you'd see the credit on your next bill, and then the promotional rate would start after that.

Customer: Okay, that's... that's actually pretty reasonable. I appreciate that. Can I ask you something though? Is there any way to lock in a rate for longer? Three-year plans don't seem to exist anymore?

Agent: That's a good question. Unfortunately, our longest promotional period right now is the twelve months I mentioned. But David, I tell you what—I'm going to put a note on your account with the customer service team that you're a long-term customer looking for rate stability. When your promotional period is about to end, you can call back and we'll make sure we reach out to you in advance with options before any rate change takes effect.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Yeah, I appreciate that.

Agent: Great. So let me just confirm what we're doing here. I'm going to apply a $30 credit to your account for this month. I'm going to enroll you in our twelve-month promotional rate at $84.99 per month starting with your next billing cycle, and I'm going to add a note to your account about reaching out to you before your promotion ends. Does that all sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Can you just... when exactly does the promotional rate start? With my next bill?

Agent: Yes, your next bill, which would be... (typing sounds) approximately 30 days from now. And the credit will show up on that same bill as well.

Customer: Alright. And I'll get some kind of confirmation or email about this?

Agent: Absolutely. You'll receive a confirmation email within the next hour or so with details about your new plan and the credit. You can also check your account online anytime to see the updated information.

Customer: Okay, great. Thanks for working with me on this, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome, David. And again, I do apologize about the lack of notification. That's definitely something we should have handled better. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks again.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier Communications, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
