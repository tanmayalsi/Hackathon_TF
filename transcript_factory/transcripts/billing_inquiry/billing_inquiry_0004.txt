Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm really confused about a charge. My internet bill went up like thirty dollars out of nowhere, and I don't understand why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your bill. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number on file.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Alright, I've got your account. I'm seeing your account is under the name Michael Torres, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So, looking at your recent bill, I can see that your monthly charge did increase. You were previously on our Fiber 300 plan at $59.99 a month, and as of last month, you've been moved to our Fiber 500 plan at $89.99 a month. Is that the increase you're referring to?

Customer: Wait, moved? I didn't ask to be moved to a different plan. Nobody called me about this. I was happy with my speed. Why would I be automatically switched?

Agent: I understand your frustration, Mr. Torres. Let me look at the notes here to see what triggered the change. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you received a promotional upgrade offer in the mail about four months ago. It looks like the promotion period on your Fiber 300 plan expired, and the system automatically upgraded you to our Fiber 500 plan as part of a retention offer.

Customer: A promotion period? I don't remember getting anything in the mail about that. And I definitely didn't agree to anything. I would've just kept what I had if I had to pay more.

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately, it does seem like there may have been a miscommunication about the terms of that promotional offer. The good news is that I can definitely help you here. I have a few options for you.

Customer: Okay, what are my options?

Agent: Well, first, I can downgrade you back to the Fiber 300 plan, and that would bring your bill back down to $59.99 a month. Second, I could look into other promotional pricing options that might be available to you right now. Or, we could work out a compromise where I speak with my supervisor about potentially crediting back some of the overage charges from the past month while you decide what you'd like to do.

Customer: How much would the credit be?

Agent: (typing sounds) The difference between what you were charged and what you should have been charged for the past month would be about thirty dollars. So I could get a credit applied to your account for that amount.

Customer: Okay, so if I get that credit, can I just go back to my old plan? The 300 plan? I don't need the extra speed. I just want my bill to go back to normal.

Agent: Absolutely, Mr. Torres. That's no problem at all. I can downgrade you back to Fiber 300 effective immediately, and I'll apply that thirty-dollar credit to your account as well. That way, you'll see the lower rate starting with your next billing cycle, and you'll have the credit show up on your current bill.

Customer: And this won't happen again, right? Like, I'm not going to get charged a different rate again without being told?

Agent: That's a great question. Once you're on the standard Fiber 300 plan, you won't be subject to any promotional expiration since you won't be on a promotional rate anymore. Your rate will stay at $59.99 per month going forward. Of course, if we ever do decide to make any changes to our pricing, you'll receive proper notice by mail and by email before any changes take effect.

Customer: Okay, good. Um, and I should mention—I'm not really using that faster speed anyway. I just stream Netflix and check email, so the 300 is plenty for me.

Agent: That makes sense. For those uses, Fiber 300 is absolutely sufficient. (pause) Alright, I'm going to go ahead and process these changes for you now. Let me just get those submitted here... (typing sounds) Okay, Mr. Torres, you're all set. I've downgraded your account to Fiber 300, applied the thirty-dollar credit, and you should see everything reflect on your next bill, which would be on the... (pause) ...the 15th of next month.

Customer: Great, thank you. I really appreciate you taking care of this.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. That was really helpful.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and again, I apologize for the confusion with that promotional period. We appreciate your business, and if you ever have any issues in the future, please don't hesitate to give us a call.

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: Have a great day, Mr. Torres.
