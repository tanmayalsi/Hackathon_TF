# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged like thirty-five dollars more this month and I have no idea why.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I also get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. And just to verify, is this for the service at 224 Evergreen Lane?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great, I've got your account right here. So you mentioned you noticed a charge increase of about thirty-five dollars. When did you first notice that?

Customer: When I got my bill yesterday. I've been with Frontier for, I don't know, three years now? And I've always paid the same amount every month—ninety-nine ninety-five. And then this month it shows one thirty-five. That's ridiculous.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, James. Let me take a look at what happened here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so looking at your account... I do see that you were on our promotional pricing for the first twelve months when you signed up. That promotion ended on November 15th of last year, and your standard rate went into effect in December.

Customer: Wait, what? I was never told about any promotional pricing. And I definitely wasn't told that my rate was going to go up like this.

Agent: I understand. Let me check your documentation here. (pause) It looks like there was information sent with your installation confirmation, and we also sent out a notice about the rate change about thirty days before it went into effect. Did you happen to receive either of those?

Customer: I mean, I probably got something in the mail, but I get so much junk mail. I'm looking at my account history here... you're saying my rate just went up out of nowhere after a year?

Agent: I can see how that would be frustrating if you didn't see the notice. The promotional rate was two years of service, excuse me—(clears throat)—the promotional rate was for the first year of service at ninety-nine ninety-five per month. After that, it transitions to our standard fiber internet rate, which is one hundred thirty-four ninety-five for our gig-speed service.

Customer: That's insane. Why would you guys offer a promotion and then just... I mean, you should have called me or something. This seems shady to me, Derek.

Agent: (pause) I hear you, James. I know this is frustrating. You know, what I can do is... let me see what options are available to you. (typing sounds) Okay, so you've been a great customer—no missed payments, three years with us. Let me check if there are any current promotions or pricing adjustments I can apply to your account.

Customer: Yeah, I'd appreciate that because I'm honestly thinking about switching providers. Comcast has been calling me about bundling cable and internet, and—

Agent: I totally understand. Let me see what I can do here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at our current promotions... We do have an option for loyal customers. I can apply a loyalty discount that would bring your rate down to one hundred fourteen ninety-five for the next twelve months. That would be... that would bring your increase down to about fifteen dollars a month instead of thirty-five.

Customer: So you're still raising my rate, just not as much? How is that a solution?

Agent: I understand it's not ideal, James. That's the best discount I have available in our system for your area. Alternatively, if budget is a concern, we do have a lower-tier service—our 500 megabit tier—which runs seventy-nine ninety-five at the standard rate, or sixty-nine ninety-five with the loyalty discount I just mentioned.

Customer: (long pause) But I'm paying for the gig speed. I've been happy with that. I don't want to downgrade my service just because you're raising my rates.

Agent: I completely understand. You know what, let me... let me see if I can do something else here. (pause, typing sounds) Can you hold for just one moment while I check with my supervisor about additional options?

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, sure, I guess.

Agent: Thank you, James. I'll be right back. (hold music plays)

Agent: (returns) Thanks for holding. Okay, so I spoke with my supervisor, and because of your excellent payment history and tenure with Frontier, I'm authorized to offer you a one-time rate adjustment. I can lock you in at one hundred nineteen ninety-five per month for the next twenty-four months. That's about a twenty dollar increase from your promotional rate, but it saves you about fifteen dollars from the standard rate we were charging you this month.

Customer: (pause) So twenty more dollars a month for two years?

Agent: That's correct. And after that twenty-four-month period, the rate would adjust to our standard pricing, but you'd receive advance notice this time. I can also put a note on your account about your promotional period to make sure you're contacted before any future rate changes.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay. Yeah, that's... that's better. I appreciate that. Can you send me something in writing with those terms so I have it for my records?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll send that confirmation to the email address we have on file, which is... (pause, typing) ...j.mitchell.224@email.com. Is that still current?

Customer: Yes, that's good.

Agent: Perfect. You should see that within the next fifteen minutes or so. And just to confirm, I'm applying the loyalty rate of one hundred nineteen ninety-five effective immediately, so your next bill will reflect that change.

Customer: Alright, Derek. Thanks for working with me on this. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. I really do apologize for the confusion with the promotional period. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and thanks for calling. You have a great day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
