Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged like sixty dollars more than usual, and I have no idea why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my service address phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get your name please?

Customer: It's Sarah Chen.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, Sarah. I'm looking at your account now. I can see that your bill this month is $119.99. Is that the charge you're referring to?

Customer: Yeah, that's way more than what I usually pay. I mean, I think I usually pay around sixty bucks, maybe sixty-five?

Agent: I understand your concern. Let me look at your billing history here. (typing sounds) Okay, so looking back at the last few months, I can see that your bill was $59.99 back in March, April, and May. Then in June, it jumped to $79.99, and now this month it's $119.99.

Customer: See, that's ridiculous! What happened? Did you guys raise my rates or something?

Agent: Let me check what changes were made to your account. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing here that... it looks like you had a promotion that was applied to your account. It was a twelve-month promotional rate of $59.99 per month for our Frontier Fiber 500 plan.

Customer: Right, yes, I remember that. That was supposed to be for a year though. It's only been like... five months? Six months?

Agent: Let me check the promotion details. (typing sounds) The promotion was valid from March through... ah, I see. It was actually a six-month promotion, not twelve months.

Customer: What? No, the guy on the phone told me it was a year. I specifically asked about that because I wanted to make sure I wouldn't get hit with some huge bill after.

Agent: I completely understand why that would be frustrating. Let me see what happened after the promotion ended in August. (pause) So after the promotion expired, your rate went to our standard price for the Fiber 500 plan, which is $79.99. But then I'm also seeing a charge here for... it looks like we added the Frontier Secure package to your account on September 15th. That's an additional $39.99 per month.

Customer: I didn't add anything! I never authorized that. I don't even know what that is.

Agent: I apologize. Let me pull up the details on that. (typing sounds) The Frontier Secure package includes antivirus protection, password management, and identity theft monitoring. It looks like it may have been added as a trial... but I'm not seeing a trial end date on this. That's unusual.

Customer: I definitely did not sign up for that. Can you just remove it?

Agent: Absolutely, I can remove that for you right now. That's definitely something that should have had your authorization. (typing sounds) Okay, I've removed the Frontier Secure package from your account effective immediately. So that will bring your next bill down to $79.99.

Customer: Okay, but what about the promotion? I mean, I'm still upset about that. The customer service rep made it sound like it was a full year.

Agent: (pause) You know what, Sarah, I really do understand your frustration there. Let me see what I can do. Unfortunately, I'm not able to verify exactly what was promised to you during that initial call, but I can absolutely see your concern. Let me put in a note here and get a supervisor to review your account. We may be able to extend that promotional rate or offer you something to make this right.

Customer: How long is that going to take?

Agent: A supervisor should review it within one to two business days, and we'll reach out to you. But in the meantime, your bill for this month—can we get that adjusted for you? You were charged $119.99, but now that we've removed the unauthorized package, it should only be $79.99. Would you like me to issue a credit for the difference?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, that would be... yes, please. That would help.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) I'm issuing a credit of $40 to your account right now. That will appear on your next billing statement. And then I'm also adding a note about the promotional rate issue so the supervisor can take a look at that.

Customer: Okay. Thank you. So someone's going to call me back?

Agent: They'll reach out within one to two business days. If you don't hear from anyone by... let's say Thursday, feel free to give us a call back and reference the notes on your account. Can I confirm we have your best number to reach you?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, that's the number on file. Sarah, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I really would appreciate it if someone could help me out with that promotion thing. I feel like I was misled.

Agent: I completely understand, and I've made a note of that. Our team will definitely take a look. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all. Thank you, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I apologize again for the confusion with your bill. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
