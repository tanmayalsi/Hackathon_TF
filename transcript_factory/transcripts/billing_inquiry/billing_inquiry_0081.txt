Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize. My internet bill just went up like thirty dollars and nobody told me about this.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my home phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. And just to confirm, is this for your service at 428 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your recent charges. I can see that your bill from last month was $79.99, and your current bill is $109.99. Is that the increase you're referring to?

Customer: Yes, exactly. That's thirty dollars more. I've been with you guys for like three years and my bill has always been the same. Why did it jump up all of a sudden?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at what's changed on your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 500 plan. It looks like there was a promotional rate that ended on your account.

Customer: A promotional rate? What do you mean? Nobody told me about any promotion ending. I thought that was just my regular price.

Agent: I completely understand. So when you first signed up three years ago, you were placed on an introductory rate of $79.99 for the first twelve months. After that period, the rate should have gone back to the regular price of $99.99, but it looks like... (pause) ...it looks like there may have been a manual override on your account that extended that promotional pricing.

Customer: Okay, so... why is it going up to $109.99 then if it's supposed to be $99.99?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me see... (typing sounds) Ah, I see now. There's also been an equipment rental charge that was added to your account about two months ago. That's $9.99 per month. It looks like that's what's bringing your total to $109.99.

Customer: Equipment rental? I didn't ask for any new equipment. I'm using the same router you guys gave me when I signed up. What equipment am I being charged for?

Agent: (pause) Let me look into that. Can you tell me... do you have a modem and a router, or just one device?

Customer: I have the router that you installed when you came out to set up my service. I don't think I have a separate modem. It's all in one thing, I think.

Agent: Okay, so the equipment charge might be for a gateway device we provided. Sometimes when we update our systems or there's a service call, equipment gets registered to the account. Can you tell me... have we done any maintenance or service calls at your location recently?

Customer: Yeah, actually, about two months ago—wait, that's exactly when you said the charge started—a technician came out because my internet was being really slow. He said something about upgrading my line or something? I don't really remember exactly what he did.

Agent: That makes sense. So it sounds like during that service call, the technician may have installed a new gateway device and added the equipment rental fee to your account. That would explain the timing.

Customer: But why wasn't I told about this charge? He should have asked me first, or someone should have called me. I mean, that's a big fee to just add without asking.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that. That should have been communicated to you. (pause) Let me see what options we have here. I can definitely remove that equipment rental charge and credit it back to your account. That would bring you back down to $99.99 per month.

Customer: Okay, well, that's better, but I'm still upset about the promotional rate expiring. I didn't know it was going to expire. I feel like you should have sent me a notice or something.

Agent: That's fair feedback, and I apologize. Typically we do send notices about rate changes, but I can see from your account that there was a notation about the promotional pricing. It's possible the notice didn't reach you, and I'm sorry about that. What I can do is... (pause) ...let me check what current promotions we have available for existing customers.

Customer: (slight pause) Okay, yeah, I'd appreciate that.

Agent: (typing sounds) So right now, we have a promotion for existing customers where I can extend your rate at $79.99 for an additional twelve months. After that, it would go to the standard $99.99 rate, but you'd have that year at the lower rate.

Customer: So you're basically just putting me back on a promotional rate again? What happens in a year? It goes back up?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. After the twelve months, it would adjust to our standard rate of $99.99, unless another promotion becomes available at that time. I understand that's not ideal, but it's the best option I have available for you right now.

Customer: (pause) Well, I mean, I guess that's something. But honestly, I'm not thrilled about the whole situation. It feels like I'm getting the runaround here.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry you've had this experience. What I'm going to do is apply the promotional rate, remove the equipment charge, and I'm also going to add a one-time service credit of $30 to your account as an apology for the lack of communication. That should bring your next bill down to $49.99 instead of $79.99.

Customer: Oh, okay. Well, that's... that's actually helpful. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. I've also made a note on your account about this situation, and I'm going to make sure that going forward, you receive proper notification about any rate changes or new charges before they're applied. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you taking care of that.

Agent: My pleasure. Your account is all set, and you should see these changes reflected on your next billing cycle. Is there a phone number or email address I should use if you have any other questions?

Customer: My email is [inaudible]@gmail.com, and you already have my phone number.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
