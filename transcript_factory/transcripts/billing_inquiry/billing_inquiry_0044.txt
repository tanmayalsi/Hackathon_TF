# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, I'm calling because I got my bill this morning and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually I do recognize it, but I wasn't told about it, so...

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's the phone number. 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the best name to have on the account?

Customer: James Morrison.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here, James. Just to verify, is your service address still 2341 Oakwood Drive in Denver?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. Now, you mentioned there's a charge you didn't expect. Can you walk me through what you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill is usually, like, $89 a month for the internet, right? And this month it jumped up to $119. That's a thirty dollar increase and nobody told me anything about it.

Agent: (pause) I completely understand your frustration, James. Let me pull up your account details here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. It looks like... yes, I see there was a price adjustment that went into effect on your account.

Customer: What do you mean, a price adjustment? I didn't agree to any price adjustment.

Agent: I understand. So what happens is, after the promotional period ends on your service plan, the rate adjusts to our standard pricing. Let me see here... (typing sounds) It looks like your introductory rate was $89 a month, and that was good for twelve months. That period ended last month, so your account transitioned to our standard fiber internet rate of $119.

Customer: Okay, but like... I mean, I should've gotten a notification about that, right? I've been a customer for years. I feel like they could've just let me keep the same rate, or at least told me it was coming.

Agent: You know, that's a really fair point, James. And I apologize that you didn't receive advance notice. We should have sent you a notification before the rate change took effect. Let me make a note of that here. (typing sounds)

Customer: So what can we do about this? I don't think I should have to pay the extra thirty dollars.

Agent: (pause) Well, I want to help you out here. Let me talk to my supervisor about some options. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays) (approximately 45 seconds pass)

Agent: Okay, James, thanks for holding. So I spoke with my supervisor, and here's what I can do for you. I can extend your promotional rate for three additional months at the $89 price point. That would give you some time to consider your options, and honestly, it's something I don't usually have the authorization to do, but given that we didn't send you proper notice, I think it's fair.

Customer: (pause) Okay, well... that's better than nothing, I guess. But after those three months, it's just gonna go back up to $119?

Agent: Correct. After those three months, yes, the rate would return to $119 unless we work something else out at that time. But I'll also make a note on your account that you'd like to be contacted before any future rate changes, so you're never surprised again.

Customer: (sighs) Alright. I mean, I appreciate that. But I gotta be honest, $119 seems pretty steep. What am I getting for that? Like, what's the speed I'm paying for?

Agent: Great question. You're currently on our 200 megabit per second fiber internet plan, which is one of our middle-tier offerings. That speed is really solid for streaming, working from home, gaming—most everyday activities.

Customer: Yeah, okay. And is there like a... a cheaper option or something?

Agent: We do have a 100 megabit plan that would be $79 a month at our standard rate. It's a step down in speed, but it's still very solid for most households, especially if you're not doing a lot of heavy downloading or multiple people streaming at once.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Can I think about that?

Agent: Absolutely. And honestly, before you make any changes, I'd recommend you try out different speeds on your current plan to see what you really need. But those are your main options. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I think... I think that covers it. So just to confirm, my bill should be $89 for the next three months starting with next month's bill?

Agent: That's right. You'll see that reflected on your next statement. And I'm going to send you an email confirmation of everything we discussed today, including my notes about the rate extension and the advance notice request.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Thank you. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. I really do apologize again for the lack of notification, and I'm glad we could find a solution that works for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and for being a loyal customer. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
