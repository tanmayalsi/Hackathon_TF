Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm seeing a charge that I don't think should be there. My internet bill just jumped up like fifty bucks, and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... (pause) Alright, I've got you here. Your name is Michael Torres?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned you're seeing an unexpected charge. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're seeing? Like, what was your bill usually, and what are you seeing now?

Customer: Well, for the last three years or so, I've been paying $79.99 a month, right? Been pretty consistent. Yesterday I got my bill and it says $129.99. That's almost fifty dollars more. I didn't authorize any changes, I didn't ask for any upgrades or anything. So I just want to know what happened.

Agent: (typing sounds) I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Torres. Let me look at your account details here. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing that you're currently on our Frontier Fiber 300 plan. Is that the plan you've been on the whole time?

Customer: Yeah, that's what I've always had. 300 speeds. That was working fine for me.

Agent: Right, and that plan should be... (pause) I'm seeing here that your promotional pricing actually expired. It looks like you were on a three-year promotional rate that ended with your last billing cycle, so your rate is now adjusting to our standard pricing for that speed tier.

Customer: Wait, wait. A promotional rate? Nobody told me anything about that. I've never heard of any expiration date on my price. Why would that just... I mean, shouldn't Frontier notify people before something like that happens?

Agent: That's a very fair question. (pause) You know, we typically do include that information in the welcome materials and in our terms and conditions, but I understand that can sometimes get lost or overlooked. And I apologize if you didn't receive a notice about it. (typing sounds) Let me check the notes on your account... 

Customer: This is ridiculous. I've been a loyal customer for three years. I pay my bill on time, I don't cause problems, and then you just raise my bill fifty bucks without any heads up?

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate your loyalty. That is frustrating. (pause) Let me see what options I have here for you. One thing I can do is look at what current promotions we have available. We actually have a great offer running right now for existing customers that might help bring that cost down.

Customer: Okay, what kind of offer?

Agent: (typing sounds) So we have a deal where if you commit to another two-year contract, I can get you back down to $89.99 a month for that Fiber 300 plan. That's still a bit more than what you were paying, but it's significantly better than the $129.99.

Customer: (pause) So I have to sign another contract? For two years?

Agent: Yes, that would be the requirement for that promotional rate. However, if you don't want to do that, I can also check if there are any shorter-term offers available... (typing sounds) (pause) We do have some month-to-month flexibility on a different package. We have a Fiber 200 plan at $99.99 with no contract.

Customer: But that's slower speeds though, right? I don't want to downgrade my speeds. I use this for working from home sometimes, and I need the reliability.

Agent: I completely understand. The Fiber 200 is still very solid for most activities, including work-from-home applications, but I get it if you want to stay with the 300. (pause) So your best option to stay on Fiber 300 would be the $89.99 rate with the two-year commitment.

Customer: (sighs) Can I think about it? And also, is there any way you could do anything about this month's bill? Like, the one I just got hit with? This came as a surprise and it's throwing off my budget.

Agent: That's totally understandable. (pause) What I can do is... let me see here... (typing sounds) I can apply a one-time courtesy credit of $40 to your account for this billing cycle. That would bring this month's bill down to $89.99, basically giving you a taste of that promotional rate I mentioned. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) I mean, that helps. That's something. Yeah, okay.

Agent: Great. I'm going to go ahead and apply that credit right now. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, that's been applied. You should see that reflected on your next bill or potentially even within the next 24 to 48 hours in your online account portal.

Customer: Okay. And if I decide to go with that two-year deal at $89.99, how would I set that up?

Agent: You can actually do it right over the phone with me right now if you'd like, or if you want to think about it, you can call us back anytime. My recommendation would be to do it sooner rather than later since this is a promotional rate and those can change. But I don't want to pressure you. What would you prefer?

Customer: (pause) You know what, I think I'll take it. I mean, if I'm going to be paying anyway, might as well lock in that rate. It beats $129.

Agent: Excellent choice, Mr. Torres. I think you'll be happy with that. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to set you up on a new two-year agreement for the Fiber 300 plan at $89.99 per month. I just need to confirm that this address is still correct for you. (pause) I'm showing 2847 Riverside Drive, Apartment 4B?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Alright, and I need your date of birth just to verify your identity for the contract.

Customer: It's 06-15-1978.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. Okay, and I'll need your email address to send you the contract confirmation.

Customer: It's mtorres284@email.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm sending that contract to you right now. (pause) You should receive it within the next few minutes. Just review it, and as long as everything looks good, you can e-sign it right there and we'll get you all set up. Your new rate will take effect on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay, great. And just to confirm, so my bill is going to be $89.99 going forward?

Agent: That's right. $89.99 per month for the next 24 months, and then if you don't cancel, it would go to the standard rate at that point. But we'll definitely reach out to you before that happens.

Customer: Good. I appreciate that. And thanks for the credit on this month, that was helpful.

Agent: Of course! I'm glad I could work something out for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. That's all I needed.

Agent: Alright, perfect. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, Mr. Torres, and thanks for calling in. You should receive that contract email shortly, and if you have any questions, just give us a call back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
