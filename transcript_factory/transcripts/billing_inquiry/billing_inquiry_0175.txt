# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm really upset about a charge that appeared on there. I've been a customer for like three years and my rate just went up like thirty dollars out of nowhere.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated with that. I'd be happy to look into this for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... hold on, let me find the bill. Okay, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. Just one moment... (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account now. Your name is James Patterson?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So I see your account here, and I do see a rate adjustment. Let me explain what happened. It looks like you were on a promotional rate for the first two years, and that promotion expired at the end of last month. Your service tier has now moved to our standard pricing. So you were paying $59.99 for our 300 megabit fiber plan, and now it's $89.99.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. Nobody told me about this. I mean, I feel like I should have gotten some kind of notice or... I don't know, something? This is ridiculous. I didn't agree to pay this much.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Let me check... (typing sounds) I do see that we sent a notification email about 30 days before the rate change took effect. It would have been sent on, let me see, October 15th.

Customer: October 15th? I don't... I mean, I probably get a ton of emails. I might have missed it. But still, this is a huge jump. Is there anything you can do about this?

Agent: Well, I appreciate you asking. What I can do is look into some alternative options that we have available right now. We actually just launched a new customer retention offer. Since you've been with us for three years, I'd be able to offer you a new rate of $69.99 for the same service tier for the next 12 months, which would save you $20 a month compared to the standard rate.

Customer: (pause) So $69.99... that's still more than what I was paying before.

Agent: That's correct. The promotional rate you had was a limited-time offer, so it is higher than that initial rate. However, this retention offer is significantly lower than the standard rate. It's actually a pretty competitive offer compared to what other providers in your area are charging for the same speed.

Customer: Hmm... (pause) What about the other charges on my bill? I'm seeing like a $12.99 equipment fee and then there's like a "regional infrastructure fee" or something? What is that?

Agent: Good questions. The equipment fee is for the modem and router that we provide for your service. That's pretty standard across the industry. And the regional infrastructure fee is... (pause) (typing sounds) that's actually a line item that Frontier uses to help cover maintenance and upgrades to the fiber network in your area. It's separate from the service charge itself.

Customer: That seems like it's just hidden in the name. Like, why can't you just include that in the actual service price? It feels like you're nickel and diming me here.

Agent: I understand how it might feel that way, and I hear that frustration. Unfortunately, these are line items that are set at a corporate level, so I'm not able to adjust those individually. However, what I can help you with is that $69.99 rate for the next year. That would help offset some of the increase you're seeing overall. Would that be something you'd be interested in?

Customer: (pause) I mean... I guess it's better than the $89.99. But I'm not thrilled about it. Do I have to sign a contract or anything? Because I don't want to get locked in.

Agent: That's a fair question. This is a 12-month offer, but it's not technically a contract. After the 12 months, your rate would adjust again unless we have another offer available at that time, which is possible. But there's no early termination fee if you wanted to leave before that year is up.

Customer: Okay, so no penalty if I want to cancel?

Agent: No penalty at all. If you want to cancel at any point, you'd just need to give us notice and we'd disconnect your service without any charges.

Customer: Alright, fine. I'll take the $69.99. But I want it in writing or something. I don't want this to change again without me knowing about it.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to apply this rate to your account right now. (typing sounds) And I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all the details of this offer, including the rate and the 12-month term. You'll receive that in the next few minutes, and you can keep that for your records.

Customer: Okay, good. When does this rate take effect?

Agent: The rate will take effect on your next billing cycle, which would be... let me see here... that would be on the 15th of next month. So your next bill should reflect the $69.99 rate.

Customer: Alright. Well, I appreciate you helping me out here. I'm still not super happy about the whole situation, but at least this makes it a little better.

Agent: I really do appreciate your patience, and I'm glad we could find a solution that works better for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just make sure you send that email so I have proof of this rate.

Agent: I've got it taken care of. You'll have that within the next few minutes. Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer for the past three years, and if you need anything else in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day, James.

Customer: Thanks. You too.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
