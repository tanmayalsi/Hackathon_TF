# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually I do recognize it, but I wasn't told about it, and I think it's wrong.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into this for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Thank you. And what's the best name to have on the account?

Customer: It's Patricia Hendricks. H-E-N-D-R-I-C-K-S.

Agent: Perfect, Patricia. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your most recent bill from... this past Tuesday. I see it's for $127.99. Is that the bill you're concerned about?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. Okay, so my bill used to be $89.99, right? And now all of a sudden it's $127.99? That's almost forty dollars more. I've been with Frontier for like... three years, and my bill has never changed. What happened?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Patricia. Let me look into the details here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your plan was adjusted about six weeks ago. It looks like you were on our promotional rate, and that promotion ended on March 15th.

Customer: A promotional rate? I didn't know I was on a promotional rate. Nobody told me about that. I thought that was just my normal bill.

Agent: I apologize for that confusion. I can see in your account notes that you did receive notification via email on... February 28th, about the upcoming rate change. Did you happen to receive that email?

Customer: Well, I mean... maybe? I get so many emails. But the thing is, if I had known my bill was going to jump up that much, I would have... I don't know, I would have done something about it. This is a lot of money, Derek.

Agent: I hear you, Patricia. That is a significant increase. Let me see what options we have here. (pause) So, I'm looking at your current service package. You're on our Gigabit Fiber plan with our premium router rental and... it looks like you also have our equipment protection plan. Is that correct?

Customer: I don't... I mean, I think I have the internet, yes, but I'm not sure about all those other things. Do I really need all that?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me walk you through what you have. The equipment protection plan is optional, and that's actually $9.99 per month. A lot of customers don't realize they have that. We can definitely remove that if you'd like.

Customer: Yes! Remove it. I didn't sign up for that. How did that even get on my account?

Agent: It may have been added as part of the initial setup. I apologize for that. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm removing that right now. That will save you about ten dollars a month going forward. So your new total would be around $117.99 before taxes.

Customer: That's better, but I'm still paying almost thirty dollars more than I was before. That's... that doesn't really solve the problem.

Agent: I understand. So the increase is primarily due to the end of your promotional pricing. You were on a new customer promotion for the first year. However, let me see what else I can do here. (pause) We do have some loyalty options available. Can you tell me... have you had any service issues with Frontier during your three years with us?

Customer: No, actually your service has been really good. I've never had any problems. That's part of why I'm so frustrated, because I like having the service, but I can't just accept a thirty-dollar increase without any explanation.

Agent: That's fair, and I really appreciate your loyalty. Because you've been a good customer with no service interruptions, I do have the ability to offer you a loyalty rate. I can get you on a plan that's $99.99 per month for the next twelve months, which is still our Gigabit Fiber service—no reduction in your internet speed or quality. After that twelve-month period, we'd reassess, but that would at least give you some time.

Customer: (pause) Really? So it would be $99.99 instead of $117.99?

Agent: That's correct. That's an eighteen-dollar savings per month compared to where you are now. Not quite back to your original promotional rate, but it's substantially better than the current standard pricing.

Customer: Okay... yeah, I mean, that's... that's actually reasonable. How long does that last again?

Agent: Twelve months. So you'd be locked in at $99.99 per month through mid-April of next year. And then we can discuss options at that time.

Customer: And this doesn't change my internet speed or anything?

Agent: Not at all. You'll still have the same gigabit speeds you have now. No change to your service quality whatsoever. It's just an adjusted rate based on your loyalty with us.

Customer: Alright. Yes, let's do that. And I want to make sure nothing else sneaks onto my bill like that equipment plan did.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to make a note on your account that you do not want any optional add-ons without your explicit permission. (typing sounds) Okay, I've added that note and I'm applying the loyalty rate now. You should see that reflected on your next bill, which will be due... (pause) let's see... April 18th. And your new recurring charge will be $99.99 per month, plus any applicable taxes in your area.

Customer: Great. Thank you for actually helping me, Derek. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome, Patricia. And again, I apologize that you weren't clearer about the promotional period ending. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thank you.

Agent: Perfect. We really appreciate your business, and thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer. You have a great day, Patricia.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
