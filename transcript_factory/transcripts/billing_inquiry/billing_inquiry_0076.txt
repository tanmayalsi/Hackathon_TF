Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement online and there's a charge that wasn't there last month. It went up like thirty bucks and nobody told me about it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Mueller. M-U-E-L-L-E-R.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, James. Let me pull that up here... Alright, I've got your account. I can see you're on our Frontier Fiber 500 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one I've had for like two years now.

Agent: Right, so looking at your most recent bill from this month... I can see your bill is $89.99. And you mentioned it went up about thirty dollars?

Customer: Yeah, last month it was like $59.99 or $60, somewhere around there. Now it's almost ninety bucks. I mean, that's a huge jump. I didn't authorize any changes or anything.

Agent: (pause) I understand your frustration, James. Let me see here... (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history and I can see that on March 15th, your promotional rate expired. You had a twelve-month promotional offer that was providing you a discount of $30 a month off the regular service rate.

Customer: Wait, a promotional rate? Nobody told me that was going to happen. I mean, I've been a customer for two years. Why would you guys just... I don't know, just let it expire without telling me?

Agent: Yeah, I can see how that would be frustrating. We should have sent you a notice prior to the expiration. Let me... let me check if we sent any communications out about this. (typing sounds) It looks like we did send an email notification about thirty days before the expiration date, on February 13th. Did you happen to see that?

Customer: I... I don't know, maybe it went to spam or something. I check my email pretty regularly but you know how it is. And honestly, if you're going to charge me an extra thirty bucks a month, maybe you should call or send something more visible than an email, you know?

Agent: (pause) That's... that's actually really fair feedback, James. I appreciate that. And look, I'm going to be honest with you—this is something I hear about fairly often. The promotional period ending can definitely catch people off guard. (typing sounds) So here's what I can do for you. I'm going to apply a credit to your account for the difference between the two rates for this current billing cycle. That would be the $30 difference, so we're going to credit you that amount.

Customer: Okay... well, that helps, but what about going forward? Like, am I stuck paying ninety bucks a month now?

Agent: That's a great question. So our standard rate for the Fiber 500 plan is $89.99 per month. However, I do have the ability to look at retention offers for valued customers like yourself. Since you've been with us for two years and this is your first issue, I might be able to work something out. Let me see what I have available here...

Customer: (background noise, sounds like TV in the background) Yeah, I appreciate that. I mean, I like the service. The internet's been really good, actually. But I can't just absorb a thirty-dollar increase every month, you know?

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely. So, here's what I'm going to do. I have a promotional rate that I can extend to you for twelve months. It would bring your bill down to $69.99 per month. That's $20 off the regular rate. Does that sound more reasonable?

Customer: (pause) Really? So it would be $69.99?

Agent: Yes, sir. For the next twelve months. And I'll send you a reminder notification ninety days before it's set to expire so you won't be surprised this time.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that... that's definitely better. I appreciate that. So you're crediting me the thirty dollars for this month too, right?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I'm applying the $30 credit right now. (typing sounds) There we go. That's processed. You should see that reflect on your next statement. The promotional rate will kick in on your next billing cycle, which based on your account would be April 12th.

Customer: Alright, thank you. I really do appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: My pleasure, James. And I want to apologize again for the frustration with the rate expiration. We should have made that more clear. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
