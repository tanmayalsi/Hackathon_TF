Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my internet bill went up like... I don't know, thirty bucks or something? I need to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated with your bill. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's, um... (pause) it's 555-0847. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm looking at your account for Sarah Mitchell, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So I see your most recent bill is for $127.89, is that the one you're concerned about?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Last month I was paying like ninety-eight dollars, maybe ninety-nine. And now it's jumped up almost thirty bucks. What changed? Did you guys raise your rates again?

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. Let me take a look at what's happening here. (typing sounds) So I'm seeing that last month you were on our standard Gig plan at $89.99 a month. This month, it looks like there was a service change on your account... (pause) Can you tell me—do you remember if you contacted us about upgrading your service or making any changes to your plan recently?

Customer: No, I didn't call anyone. I wouldn't upgrade anything. I don't want my bill to go up. I barely use the internet that much—it's just me and my roommate. Why would I upgrade?

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me check the details here. I'm seeing a note that says... (pause) it looks like there was a promotional period that expired on your account. You were on an introductory rate of $89.99 for the first twelve months, and that promotional period just ended last month. So your rate has adjusted to our standard pricing for that plan, which is $119.99.

Customer: (frustrated) So you're telling me you automatically raised my rate without asking me? That's not—I mean, when I signed up, nobody told me it was just going to jump up like this.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. These promotional rates are typically mentioned at the time of signup, though I know it's easy to miss those details. The good news is that we do have some options available to you. (typing sounds) I'm actually seeing that we have a loyalty promotion running right now for existing customers. I could potentially put you on a different plan that would bring your rate down to $99.99 for the next twelve months.

Customer: Really? That's... okay, that's better than what I'm paying now, but it's still more than what I was paying before. Why can't you just keep me at the $89.99?

Agent: (pause) I appreciate you asking. Unfortunately, that introductory rate was specific to new customers, so I'm not able to reactivate that exact rate. But the $99.99 rate I'm offering is our best rate for existing customers right now, and it would save you twenty dollars a month compared to where you are now.

Customer: Hmm... (pause) Well, that's still an increase from the $89.99 I was paying. I mean, ten dollars a month adds up. Can you do any better than that?

Agent: Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds, longer pause) I'm going to check what other promotions might be available... Okay, I can also see if there's any way to adjust this, but I want to be honest with you—the $99.99 rate is really the best I can offer right now without downgrading your service to a lower tier. Is there anything else on the bill that seemed unusual to you? You mentioned there was a charge you didn't recognize?

Customer: Oh, yeah! There's also a $12.99 charge for something called... (pause) "Advanced WiFi Modem Rental." I don't rent a modem. I bought my own modem years ago. Why am I being charged for something I'm not using?

Agent: (typing) Okay, let me look into that for you. That's definitely something we can address. Do you happen to know when that charge first appeared on your bill?

Customer: I don't know, honestly. I usually just pay the bill without looking at it too closely. But when I saw it spike this time, I actually looked through it line by line, and that's when I noticed it.

Agent: (pause) I'm looking at your account history here, and it looks like the modem rental charge was added about three months ago. I'm not seeing any work order or service request that would explain why that was added. That's unusual.

Customer: Three months?! So I've been charged for three months for something I don't even use? That's like forty bucks down the drain.

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. Let me take care of this for you right now. I'm going to remove that modem rental charge immediately. (typing) And I'm actually going to credit you for the last three months of charges since there's no documentation of why that was added in the first place. That should be about $38.97 that I'm putting back on your account.

Customer: Oh... okay, wow. Well, that helps. Thank you. So what about the rate increase then? Are you saying $99.99 is the absolute best you can do?

Agent: (pause) Let me try one more thing here. I'm going to add a courtesy credit of $10 a month for the next six months to help bridge that gap between your old introductory rate and the current promotion. So effectively, you'd be paying $89.99 for the next six months, and then it would go to $99.99 after that. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Really? You can do that?

Agent: Yes, I can absolutely do that. I want to make sure we keep you as a valued customer, and I understand that unexpected increases can be frustrating. This credit will be applied to your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay, yeah... that's much better. I appreciate that. So just to confirm—I'm getting the forty bucks back for the modem thing, and then I'll be paying $89.99 for the next six months?

Agent: (typing) Yes, that's correct. You'll see the $38.97 credit applied to your account, and the $10 monthly credit will start on your next billing cycle, bringing your rate to $89.99. After six months, the rate will adjust to $99.99 unless another promotion becomes available.

Customer: Alright, that works for me. And you said you'd remove that modem rental charge permanently, right? Because I don't actually need that.

Agent: Yes, I'm removing it from your account completely as of today. You won't see that charge going forward.

Customer: Great. Is there anything else I need to do on my end?

Agent: No, you shouldn't need to do anything. Everything will process automatically on your next billing cycle. Your new bill should reflect the credits and the removed charge. You'll receive an updated bill within the next few days.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you for taking care of this. I really appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. I apologize again for the confusion with the rate increase and that unauthorized modem charge. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to give us a call. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks again, Derek.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
