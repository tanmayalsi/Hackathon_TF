# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. Can I have your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, it's 555-0147. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I don't know, something doesn't look right.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up for you. Can I also get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. Thank you. And just to confirm, is this the address on East Pinewood Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned something looks off on your bill. What seems to be the issue?

Customer: Well, my bill jumped up like forty bucks this month. Last month I was paying 79.99, and now it's showing 119.99. I didn't authorize any changes, and I don't remember anyone calling me about a price increase or anything like that.

Agent: (pause) I understand that's frustrating, James. Let me take a look at your account here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that last month you were on our Fiber Starter plan at $79.99. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's what I've been paying for like two years now.

Agent: Understood. And I'm seeing that this current bill reflects a change to our Fiber Elite plan at $119.99. (pause) Do you remember making that change, or...?

Customer: No! I didn't change anything. Why would I do that? I don't even use that much internet. I just check email, watch Netflix sometimes... that's it.

Agent: Okay, I hear you. (typing sounds) Let me look into this a little further. It looks like according to our system, the plan change was initiated on... the 15th of last month. There's no note here about an agent calling you to confirm it, which... that's unusual. Did you perhaps make any changes yourself online through your account portal?

Customer: No, I didn't touch anything. I just log in to pay my bill. Is this some kind of scam? Can you just change people's plans without asking them?

Agent: No, absolutely not, and I apologize for the confusion here. That shouldn't happen. Let me escalate this to our billing department to investigate how this change got made. But in the meantime, I can absolutely get you switched back to your Fiber Starter plan right now.

Customer: Okay, yeah, do that. And I don't want to be charged for this month either, obviously.

Agent: I completely understand. So I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I reach out to my supervisor to get authorization for a credit. This should just take a minute or two. Is that okay?

Customer: Yeah, fine.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Thank you for your patience, James. Okay, so I've got approval to credit your account for the difference between the two plans for this billing cycle. That's a credit of $40. So you'll only be charged the $79.99 for this month.

Customer: Okay, that's good. But what about next month? How do I know this won't happen again?

Agent: That's a great question. So I'm going to make a note on your account that you did not authorize this change. And I'm going to put a flag here that any future plan modifications need to be manually confirmed by you first. I'll also be sending this over to our billing investigation team, and they'll look into how this happened on their end.

Customer: (pause) Alright. And you're putting me back on the Fiber Starter plan?

Agent: Yes, I'm processing that right now. (typing sounds) Okay, that's all set. Your plan is officially back to Fiber Starter at $79.99. That will take effect on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Good. When will I see the credit?

Agent: The credit of $40 should appear on your account within the next billing cycle, which... (typing sounds) looks like that would be around the 12th of next month.

Customer: Okay, I guess that works. I'm still not happy about this happening in the first place, but at least you're fixing it.

Agent: I completely understand, and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. This definitely shouldn't have happened, and we'll make sure to figure out what went wrong. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. I just... keep an eye on it, okay?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to make sure this is followed up on. Is there any other way you'd like us to contact you if we need any additional information?

Customer: Um, just email me. I don't really want phone calls about this.

Agent: Perfect. We have your email on file, and I'll make a note of that. You should expect to hear from our billing team within the next 3 to 5 business days via email. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for fixing this, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and again, I apologize for the trouble. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
