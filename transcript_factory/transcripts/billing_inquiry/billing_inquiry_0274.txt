Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I've been a customer for like three years and my bill has never been this high.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. Let me pull that up here. One moment, please.

(pause)

Agent: Alright, I've got your account here. I'm looking at your most recent bill. Can you tell me which charge you're concerned about?

Customer: Well, the whole thing is concerning, honestly. Last month I paid $89.99 for my gigabit fiber plan, and this month it's showing $119.99. That's like thirty dollars more. Did you guys raise prices on everyone or... I mean, I don't remember getting a notification about this.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at what's happening here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you were on a promotional rate that expired at the end of last month. You were locked in at $89.99 for 12 months, and that promotion period has now ended.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't agree to any promotional rate. I've just been paying that same price since I signed up. Nobody told me this was going to happen.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me review your account history to see exactly what was set up. (pause) So it looks like when you initially signed up three years ago, you were actually enrolled in a 12-month promotional rate. However, I'm not seeing where we sent you a courtesy notice about the expiration. That's on us, and I apologize for that.

Customer: So you're just... raising my rates? Is there anything I can do about this? I was happy with the price I was paying.

Agent: Well, let me explain what happened here. After your promotional period ended, your account moved to our standard rate for the gigabit fiber plan in your area, which is $119.99 per month. However, because you've been such a loyal customer and we should have notified you about this change, I do have some options available to me.

Customer: Okay, like what?

Agent: I can extend a loyalty promotion for you. I can bring your rate back down to $99.99 per month for the next 12 months. That's a ten-dollar savings from the standard rate, and it's the best I can offer on your plan level right now.

Customer: Hmm... but that's still more than the $89.99 I was paying before.

Agent: I know, and I hear you. Unfortunately, pricing has gone up in general over the past three years, and the $89.99 rate was specific to that initial promotion. The $99.99 is genuinely the lowest I can get you locked in for another year as a loyalty offer. After that, we'd revisit your rate again.

Customer: (sighs) This feels like... I don't know. It feels like you guys are penalizing people who have been with you for a long time. Like, if I were a new customer, what would you charge me?

Agent: That's a fair question. New customers right now are being offered the gigabit plan at $109.99 for the first year. So actually, even our new customer rate is higher than what I'm able to offer you, which is $99.99.

Customer: Well, I guess that's something. But I'm still not happy about how this was handled. I should have gotten a letter or an email or something before my bill jumped thirty dollars.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I genuinely apologize for that. We should have been proactive in notifying you. Is there anything else I can help clarify about your bill or your service?

Customer: No, I... I guess I'll take the $99.99 rate. Can you lock that in for me right now?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to apply that loyalty promotion to your account effective immediately. (typing sounds) Your new rate will be $99.99 per month for the next 12 months, and you should see that reflected on your next billing cycle. You'll receive a confirmation email within the next couple of hours with all the details of this change.

Customer: Okay. And after the 12 months?

Agent: After that, your rate would go to the current standard rate at that time, but you'd have the option to call us back and see what promotions we have available then. Depending on your service area and our current offers, there might be other options.

Customer: Alright, I guess I'll just have to make sure I call you guys before next year so I don't get surprised again.

Agent: That's a smart approach. And honestly, if you give us a call around month 11, we can usually work something out before your rate adjusts. I'm also going to add a note to your account flagging this issue so that if you do call back, the team will be aware of this situation.

Customer: That would be helpful, thanks. I appreciate it, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks for your help.

Agent: Thank you so much for being a loyal Frontier customer for the past three years. We really do appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
