Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm absolutely confused about these charges. My internet bill went up like thirty dollars. Thirty dollars! And I don't understand why, and nobody told me about this.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account and take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up right now. Just one moment... Alright, I've got your account here. Your name is Patricia Malone, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So Patricia, I can see you're on our Frontier Fiber 500 plan. I'm looking at your last bill here... (pause) I see the increase you're referring to. Can you tell me what your bill was previously, and what it is now?

Customer: Well, my bill was 79.99, and now it's showing 109.99. That's almost thirty dollars more! I've been a customer for... I don't know, probably four years now? And I've never had any issues with my service. Why would you just raise my price like that without telling me?

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate your loyalty. Let me break down what I'm seeing here. (typing sounds) It looks like you were on a promotional rate that expired. You were locked in at $79.99 for 24 months, and that promotional period ended last month.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about that. I got a letter maybe... I don't know when, but I didn't read anything about the price going up.

Agent: I understand. Let me check the notes on your account to see what communications we sent out. (pause, typing) Okay, so it looks like we did send you a notification letter about 30 days before your promotion expired. That would have been... mid-November. Did you receive something from us around that time?

Customer: I mean, I get a lot of mail, Derek. I might have thrown it away. I don't know. But that doesn't seem right. You should have called me or sent an email or something. Like, actually notified me, you know?

Agent: You make a fair point. I can definitely see where you're coming from. The thing is, our standard practice is to send a written notice, but I completely understand that things can get lost. So, $109.99 would be our standard rate for Fiber 500 right now. However, I do want to help you here. Let me see what options I have available for you.

Customer: Well, I appreciate that. I mean, I like my internet speed and everything. It works great. I just don't want to pay like $110 a month for it.

Agent: I totally get that. (typing sounds) Alright, so what I can do for you is... I can offer you a new promotional rate. Since you've been such a loyal customer for four years, I can lock you in at $84.99 for 12 months. That's a five dollar increase from your original price, but it's significantly less than the regular rate.

Customer: Hmm. So I'd still be paying more than I was before?

Agent: Yes, unfortunately. The market rates have gone up across the board, and we just don't have promotional rates that match the original one you had. But $84.99 is the best I can do for you. And after that 12 months, we can discuss your options again when that promotion expires.

Customer: (pause) I mean... that's still not ideal, but it's better than $109.99. What if I called around to see what other providers are offering? I'm sure some of the cable companies have deals.

Agent: That's absolutely your right, of course. But I will say that our Fiber 500 service is typically faster and more reliable than a lot of the cable options in your area. Plus, if you do leave, you lose that service quality. But again, you're welcome to shop around if you'd like.

Customer: No, no, I mean, I don't really want to switch. The service is good. I just hate the price increase, you know? It feels like a bait and switch kind of thing.

Agent: I really do understand your frustration, Patricia. And your feedback is valuable. Look, let me see if there's anything else I can do. (typing sounds) Okay, so normally I can't do this, but given your tenure with us, I'm going to credit your account $25 as a one-time customer loyalty credit. That will be applied to your next bill.

Customer: Really? (pause) Okay, well that helps. So if I take the $84.99 rate with the $25 credit, my next bill would be...?

Agent: Right, so your next bill would be $59.99 with that credit applied. And then after that, you'd be at the regular $84.99 per month. The credit is just for this one bill to help ease the transition.

Customer: Okay. Okay, yeah, I think that works. I appreciate that, Derek. I'm sorry for being... I was just really frustrated when I called in.

Agent: Please, don't apologize at all. Your frustration is completely valid, and I'm glad I could help make this right for you. So let me just confirm everything. I'm applying a $25 loyalty credit to your account, and I'm moving you to our Fiber 500 promotional rate of $84.99 per month for 12 months, effective immediately.

Customer: Yes, that sounds good.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm processing that right now. (pause) Alright, it's all set. You should see the changes reflected on your next bill. You'll receive that in about... ten days or so. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: Absolutely, Patricia. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business. If you have any issues with your service or billing, don't hesitate to reach out. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
