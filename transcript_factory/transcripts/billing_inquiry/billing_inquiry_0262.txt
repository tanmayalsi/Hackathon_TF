Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I've been a customer for, I don't know, like three years now, and this has never shown up before.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. Just one moment... Alright, I've got your account. I'm showing the account is under the name Robert Chen. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned there's a charge on your bill that you don't recognize. Can you tell me which charge you're referring to and approximately how much it is?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill was usually like $89 a month, right? But this month it jumped up to $119. That's thirty bucks more. And I don't know why. I didn't add any services or anything like that.

Agent: (pause) I understand your concern, Mr. Chen. A thirty-dollar increase would definitely be surprising. Let me take a look at your account details here... (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing that your promotional pricing plan expired. You had a promotion that was running for 24 months, and it looks like that concluded last month. So your rate has adjusted to our standard pricing for your internet package.

Customer: Wait, wait. What? Nobody told me about that. I mean, I got some emails probably, but... I don't remember seeing anything about this. That seems kind of shady that you just... you know, quietly raise the price after the promotional period.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. And I apologize that wasn't communicated more clearly to you. Typically we do send out notifications before a promotion expires, but I can see how those might get missed. The good news is I have some options for you. Let me see what I can do here.

Customer: Okay... I appreciate that. What kind of options?

Agent: (typing sounds) So right now, you're on our Fiber 500 plan at the standard rate of $119.99 per month. I can actually put you back on a promotional rate. We have a new customer promotion I can apply retroactively to your account—that would bring your rate down to $99.99 a month for the next 12 months. How does that sound?

Customer: That's better than $119, but it's still ten more than what I was paying before.

Agent: You're right. I hear you. After that 12-month period, it would go back to the standard rate again. However, let me check if there's anything else I can do... (pause, typing sounds) So I'm looking at your account history, and I can see you've been a great customer—never missed a payment, no service issues. Because of that loyalty, I can actually offer you an additional $5 discount on top of the promotional rate. So that would bring you to $94.99 a month for the next 12 months.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so that's five bucks less than the original price I was paying. But what happens after the 12 months?

Agent: After the 12 months, your rate would adjust to our standard pricing, which is currently $119.99. However, you'd be welcome to call back at that time and we can look at what other promotions or options might be available to you then.

Customer: And you're not gonna just sneak the rate change on me without telling me?

Agent: No sir, I promise you. We will send you notifications via email before the promotion expires, and you'll get a courtesy call about two weeks before the change takes effect. You'll have plenty of notice.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I guess that works. But I want to make sure—you're gonna credit my account for the overage this month, right? The thirty dollars?

Agent: (pause, typing) That's a fair point. Let me get that set up for you. I'm going to issue a one-time courtesy credit of $29.99 to your account for this billing cycle. It should show up on your next bill within the next 48 hours.

Customer: Okay, yeah. I appreciate that. So to confirm—$94.99 for the next 12 months, and then we'll talk about options before it changes again?

Agent: Exactly right. And I'm putting a note on your account that you'd like to be contacted before any rate changes take effect. You'll definitely hear from us. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you taking care of this. I just... you know, I wish it had been more transparent from the beginning.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the frustration this caused. We'll do better on our end with the communication. Is there a preferred contact method? Phone call, email, or both?

Customer: Email is fine. That's the best way to reach me.

Agent: Perfect. I've got that noted here. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, Mr. Chen, and I really do apologize again for the confusion. If you need anything else in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Alright, thanks. Have a good one.

Agent: You too, and thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day.
