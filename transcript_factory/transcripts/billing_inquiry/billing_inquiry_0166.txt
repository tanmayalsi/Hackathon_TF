Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged... I mean, I got my statement this morning and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like thirty dollars from last month. I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your charges. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's the same as my cell phone number on file. It should be... it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... (pause) Alright, I've got your account. I'm showing your name is Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, I'm looking at your bill from... this would be for your August statement, correct?

Customer: Yes. August. I got it this morning, and I'm looking at it right now. There's a charge for like $34.99 that just says "equipment upgrade" or something. I never asked for an equipment upgrade. I don't know what that is, and then my monthly service went from 89.99 to 119.99. That's thirty dollars more than what I'm supposed to be paying.

Agent: Okay, I understand your frustration. Let me look into both of those for you. (typing sounds) So, I'm seeing the equipment upgrade charge... that appears to be for a modem replacement. Do you remember receiving a new modem recently?

Customer: No, I... wait, actually, maybe? I got a package maybe two weeks ago, but I thought that was something else. I didn't open it. It's still in my closet somewhere. I've had the same modem for like three years and it works fine. Why would they send me a new one without asking?

Agent: That's a good question. Let me check your account notes here. (pause) It looks like our systems flagged your modem as reaching end-of-life. So the equipment was sent proactively to ensure you continue to have quality service. However, we should have notified you before charging you for it.

Customer: So you're saying you just charged me thirty-five dollars for something I didn't ask for?

Agent: I completely understand why that's frustrating. What I can do is, first of all, remove that equipment upgrade charge for you since you didn't authorize it and we didn't give you proper notice. That's on us.

Customer: Okay, that's... that's something, I guess. But what about the service increase? That's the bigger issue here. I've been paying 89.99 for two years. Why did my price just jump?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Let me pull up your service history... I'm seeing here that you're on our Gigabit Plus plan, is that correct?

Customer: I mean, I think so? I don't really... I just know I had 500 meg speeds and it was 89.99 a month.

Agent: Right. So it looks like... (pause) okay, so in July you were on a promotional rate. That promotional period ended with your August billing cycle, so your rate adjusted to the regular pricing for that service tier, which is $119.99.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. Nobody told me about a promotion ending. I was never told that my rate was going to go up. That's... that's not fair. You can't just surprise people with price increases like that.

Agent: You know, I completely hear you on that. And I apologize that you weren't made aware of the promotion terms upfront. Let me see what options I have here for you. (typing sounds) (pause) 

Customer: I mean, if I had known this was coming, I probably would have downgraded or looked at other providers. I only paid 89.99 because that was the deal you offered me when I signed up.

Agent: I understand, and I appreciate your patience. So I'm pulling up our retention options here. Given that you've been a loyal customer for two years, and because of the situation with the equipment charge and the lack of notification on the promotion ending, I can offer you something. We have a promotional rate available right now for your service level. I can put you back on a promotional rate of $99.99 per month for the next twelve months. After that, it would go back to the regular rate, but you would receive notice.

Customer: (pause) Ninety-nine ninety-nine? So that's ten dollars more than what I was paying, but ten dollars less than what you're charging me now?

Agent: That's correct. It's a middle ground, and I know it's not quite the same as your original rate, but it does represent significant savings from the current $119.99, and it gives you a year to plan ahead before any future adjustments.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) And you're removing the $34.99 charge?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I'm removing that right now. (typing sounds) That's done. And then I'll apply the promotional rate for the next twelve months starting with your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay, so my next bill should be... what, should be around $100?

Agent: Yes, approximately $99.99 for your service, plus any applicable taxes and fees in your area, but the service charge will be $99.99. And I'm also going to add a one-time courtesy credit of $15 to your account for the inconvenience with the equipment charge and the promotion notification issue.

Customer: (pause) Alright, well... I appreciate that. I mean, I'm still not thrilled about paying more than before, but at least you're doing something about it.

Agent: I'm glad I could help resolve this for you, Robert. Just to recap everything: I've removed the $34.99 equipment upgrade charge, I've applied a promotional rate of $99.99 for twelve months starting next billing cycle, and I've added a $15 courtesy credit. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?

Customer: No, I think... I think that covers it. But just, going forward, can you like, send me a notice or something when my promotion is ending?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to make a note on your account requesting that we send you advance notification. And honestly, when you get that new modem—you don't have to use it right away, but when you do swap it out, it should provide you with even better speeds and reliability.

Customer: Okay. Well, thank you, Marcus. I appreciate you taking care of this.

Agent: You're welcome, Robert. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: Great. Have a wonderful day, and thanks again for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
