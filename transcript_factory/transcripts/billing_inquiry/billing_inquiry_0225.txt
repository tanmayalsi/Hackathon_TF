# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and I'm seeing a charge that shouldn't be there, and honestly, my monthly rate went up again and I'm getting really frustrated.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm sorry you're frustrated. Let me pull up your account and take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. And my phone number is also on there, it should be 555-0892.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now... Got it. I'm seeing your account here under James Martinez, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, James. So you mentioned a charge that shouldn't be there and also a rate increase? Let me start with the rate increase first. Looking at your account, I can see that your monthly service charge did increase from $79.99 to $94.99 as of your last billing cycle. Is that what you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. That's fifteen dollars more a month. I've been with Frontier for six years, and every time I turn around, the bill goes up. When did they start charging more? I wasn't notified about this.

Agent: (pause) I can definitely understand your frustration, especially when you've been a loyal customer for that long. According to my notes here, we did send out a notification about service plan adjustments about thirty days prior to the rate change. It looks like that would have been in your bill statement about two months ago. However, I want to make sure I understand—did you not receive any notification at all?

Customer: No, I didn't see anything. And even if there was something in the bill, I mean, you guys should be more upfront about price increases. That's a pretty significant jump.

Agent: You know, that's fair feedback, and I really appreciate you saying that. Let me see what I can do for you. First, can you tell me about that other charge you mentioned? What charge did you want to dispute on your current bill?

Customer: Okay, so there's... (typing sounds in background) ...there's a fifteen-dollar charge that says "Equipment Upgrade Fee." I didn't ask for any upgrade. I didn't authorize that. That's got to be a mistake.

Agent: Let me take a look at that. (pause, typing sounds) Hmm, I'm seeing that charge on your account. Do you remember receiving any communication about upgrading your modem or router?

Customer: No, nothing. And my internet's been working fine anyway. I don't need any upgrades. I think someone messed up on your end.

Agent: Let me investigate this for you. It's possible that this could be an error, or there might be a miscommunication. Sometimes if there's an issue with equipment, our technical team can authorize a replacement and that fee gets applied, but I don't see a service ticket or trouble call on your account that would have triggered that. This does seem like it might be an error on our part.

Customer: Well, can you just remove it then?

Agent: I absolutely can help with that. What I'm going to do is I'm going to credit that fifteen-dollar equipment fee back to your account right now. That should appear on your next billing statement. (typing sounds) Okay, that's done.

Customer: (pause) Okay, good. Thanks. But what about the rate increase? That's still an issue for me.

Agent: Right, so here's what I can do about that. Since you've been such a loyal customer with us for six years, I can actually apply a promotional rate reduction to your account for the next twelve months. I can bring you down to... let me see here... I can get you down to $84.99 per month instead of the new $94.99. That would save you ten dollars a month, which amounts to a hundred and twenty dollars over the year.

Customer: So I'm still paying more than I was originally paying?

Agent: (pause) Yes, that's correct. The new service tier does cost more than your previous plan, but this promotion would help minimize that increase. The fifteen dollars we discussed is coming off, so really you'd only be looking at a five-dollar increase from your original $79.99 rate, but with the promotional discount applied, it would be ten dollars less than the standard new rate.

Customer: Hmm. I mean... I guess that's something. But I'm still not happy about it. What if I just want to cancel? Do you have other options available?

Agent: Well, I want to make sure we don't lose you as a customer, James. Before we talk about cancellation, let me tell you what your options are. The rate increase is company-wide and applies to all new service tiers. However, I can also look at whether there are any other promotions or bundling options that might work better for you. Are you currently using any other Frontier services, like phone or TV?

Customer: No, just internet. I use streaming services, so I don't need the TV package.

Agent: Okay, I understand. So the promotion I mentioned—that $84.99 rate for twelve months—that's probably going to be your best option. After that year is up, the rate would go back to the standard $94.99, but at that point we can certainly revisit your account and look at other options or promotions that might be available.

Customer: And what if I cancel before the year is up? Would there be a cancellation fee or anything?

Agent: Good question. Since this is a promotional offer and you don't have a service contract, you wouldn't face any early termination fees if you decided to cancel. However, the promotional rate would only apply for as long as the promotion is active on your account.

Customer: (pause) Alright. So to be clear—you're crediting back the fifteen dollars from this month, and you're putting me on the promotional rate of $84.99 for the next year?

Agent: Exactly right. The fifteen-dollar equipment fee is already credited. And I'm going to apply the $84.99 promotional rate starting with your next billing cycle. You should see both of those changes reflected in your next statement. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... I mean, I'm still not thrilled about the increase overall, but at least this helps. I appreciate you taking care of the equipment charge.

Agent: I'm glad I could help, James. And I really do appreciate your business over these past six years. If you have any other issues or concerns down the line, please don't hesitate to give us a call back. We're here to help.

Customer: Okay, thanks, Marcus.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
