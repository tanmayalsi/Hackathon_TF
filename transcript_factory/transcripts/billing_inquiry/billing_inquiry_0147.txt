Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge I don't recognize. Well, actually I do recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it, and I think it's wrong.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. Let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Sarah Chen.

Agent: Perfect, thank you Sarah. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account now. I can see your bill from this month. What charge are you seeing that doesn't look right?

Customer: So on my current bill, my monthly service charge went up. I was paying $79.99 for my Fiber 500 plan, and now it's showing $94.99. That's like a $15 increase. I wasn't notified about any price change, and I don't understand why it jumped up so much all of a sudden.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Sarah. Let me look into that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that... yes, your plan did change. Can I ask, do you remember receiving any notices in the mail or emails about a rate adjustment?

Customer: No, nothing. I mean, I get emails from Frontier, but I don't remember seeing anything about a price increase. That seems like something you guys should be more upfront about.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that. We should have made that clearer. So what happened here is that your promotional pricing expired. You were on an introductory rate of $79.99 for your first year, and that 12-month period just ended, so you've moved into the standard rate for that plan, which is $94.99.

Customer: (pause) Wait, I... I didn't know I was on a promotional rate. I mean, I've had service with you for like... I think it's been about 14 months now? So the first year was promo pricing?

Agent: (pause) Let me double-check the start date of your service... (typing sounds) Yes, so looking at your account, your service was activated on March 15th of last year. So the promotional period would have ended around mid-March of this year. And it looks like the rate change took effect on your April billing cycle, which is correct.

Customer: Okay, so... when I signed up, I should have been told about this. I don't remember anyone mentioning that my rate would go up after a year. That feels kind of deceptive, honestly.

Agent: I hear you, and I'm really sorry about that. You're right—we should be more transparent about promotional terms upfront. Unfortunately, this is the standard pricing structure for new customers. But here's what I can do for you. Let me look at what options we have available...

Customer: What do you mean, options?

Agent: Well, I have the ability to offer you some promotional pricing as a loyalty offer. (typing sounds) Let me see what I can get approved for you. (pause) So I can offer you an extended promotional rate. I can get you back down to $84.99 per month for another 12 months. That would be a $10 savings compared to the standard rate, and it would give you some time to consider your options.

Customer: So it would go up again after 12 months though?

Agent: Yes, after the 12 months, it would go back to the standard rate of $94.99 unless we extend it again or you switch to a different plan. However, you'd be able to call in again and we could potentially work something out at that time.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. I mean, that's better than the $94.99, but... is there anything else? Like, could I downgrade to a lower plan? What would that cost?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me pull up our current plan offerings for your area. (typing sounds) Okay, so we have a Fiber 300 plan that's currently $64.99 per month for new customers, which comes with 300 Mbps download speeds. Would that be sufficient for your needs?

Customer: I mean, I don't know. I've had the 500, so it seems like a step down. How much slower would it actually be? I work from home sometimes, and I stream a lot.

Agent: For working from home and streaming, honestly, the 300 Mbps plan would handle that really well. You could do multiple things at once without any issues. The 500 Mbps would give you more overhead, but for most everyday uses, the 300 would be plenty. And that would get you down to $64.99 a month for the introductory period.

Customer: (pause) [inaudible] ...that's $30 less than what I'm paying now.

Agent: Right, but that would be a new promotional rate for 12 months as well, so it would go up after that period.

Customer: (slight laugh) Yeah, I think I see the pattern here. So everything goes up after a year.

Agent: (pause) I understand how that feels. Um, honestly... (pause) Let me make you another offer. If you're willing to stay with the Fiber 500 plan, I can lock in that $84.99 rate for 24 months instead of 12. That would give you some price stability for a longer period.

Customer: Really? You can do that?

Agent: Let me just check with my supervisor really quick to make sure I can extend it for that full period. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Sure, yeah.

Agent: (hold music plays for about 15 seconds) Thank you for holding, Sarah. Okay, I was able to get approval for that. So I can offer you the Fiber 500 plan at $84.99 per month for 24 months. After that period, the rate would return to standard pricing, but at least you'd have two years of price stability.

Customer: Okay, that's... that's actually much better. I appreciate that. Can you apply that to my account right now?

Agent: Absolutely. (typing sounds) I'm applying that promotional rate to your account now. Let me just confirm all the details for you. Fiber 500 plan, $84.99 per month, for 24 months beginning with your next billing cycle. The next charge will reflect that new rate. And this promotion will expire on... (pause) ...April 15th, 2026.

Customer: Okay, great. And you're sending me something confirming this, right?

Agent: Yes, I'm sending a confirmation email to the email address on file right now. You should receive that within the next few minutes. And it'll have all the details of the promotion and when it expires.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. And again, I'm really sorry about the confusion with the promotional pricing not being clearly communicated. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate your help, Derek.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier, Sarah. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye!
