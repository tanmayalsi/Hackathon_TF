# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I don't know, something doesn't look right. My internet bill jumped up like thirty dollars compared to last month, and I have no idea why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your bill. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number tied to it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. Can I also verify the address on file? Is it 2847 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account now. I can see your previous bill was $79.99, and your current bill is $109.99. So yes, there is a $30 increase. Let me see what might have caused that... (typing sounds)

Customer: Right, exactly. I mean, I haven't changed anything. I didn't upgrade or add any services or anything like that. So I'm really confused why it went up so much.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me walk through this with you. I'm looking at your service package... it looks like you're on our Fiber 500 plan, which was promotional pricing at $79.99 per month.

Customer: Okay, so what does that mean? Did the promotion end or something?

Agent: That actually looks like what happened here. (pause) You signed up for that plan back in March, correct?

Customer: Yeah, March. We've had it for... what, like eight months now?

Agent: Nine months, actually. So your promotional period was for twelve months, but I'm seeing... hmm, that's odd. (typing sounds) The promotion ended early on your account. It should still have about three months left.

Customer: Wait, what? So you're telling me the promotion wasn't supposed to end yet?

Agent: Hold on, let me just verify something. Can you give me one second? (brief hold with background music)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. Yeah, I'm looking at the notes here and I think I see what happened. It looks like there was a system adjustment made to your account, but I'm not seeing the reason documented. Let me check our recent promotions and rate changes...

Customer: So what does that mean? Can you fix it or...?

Agent: (pause) Okay, so here's what I'm seeing. You're right—your promotional rate should still be active through March. This appears to have been a billing error on our end. I'm really sorry about that.

Customer: Okay, so what does that mean going forward? Am I gonna get refunded for the overage, or...?

Agent: Let me take care of that for you right now. I'm going to apply a service credit to your account for the difference. That's $30. (typing sounds) And I'm going to make sure your promotional rate is reinstated, so you'll go back to $79.99 starting with your next bill cycle.

Customer: Okay, that's... that's good. I appreciate that. But like, how did this happen in the first place? Is this something I need to worry about happening again?

Agent: That's a fair question. From what I can see, it looks like there was a manual adjustment made to your account, but again, there's no note explaining why. I'm going to flag this for my supervisor to review, and I can add a note to make sure this doesn't happen again. This shouldn't have occurred.

Customer: Alright. And the credit—when will that show up on my bill?

Agent: The credit will be applied within the next billing cycle, so you should see that reflected on your next statement, which looks like... (typing sounds) ...that would be next Thursday. You'll see it listed as a service adjustment credit.

Customer: Okay, that works. I mean, I'm still annoyed that it happened, but I appreciate you fixing it.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Just... maybe keep an eye on things, you know? Make sure this doesn't happen again.

Agent: Absolutely. I've made a note on your account and flagged it for supervisor review. If you have any other issues, you can always reach out to us. We're here to help.

Customer: Alright, thanks Marcus.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and thanks for your patience today. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye!
