Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged like fifty dollars more this month and I have no idea why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing an issue with your billing. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account please?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, thank you David. I'm looking at your account now. I can see you're on our Fiber 200 internet plan. Let me just check your recent charges here... (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your bill from this month. Can you tell me what your bill was last month compared to this month?

Customer: Yeah, last month it was like $89.99, and this month it jumped to... it's showing $139.99. That's fifty bucks more! I haven't changed anything on my account.

Agent: I understand your frustration, David. That is quite an increase. Let me see what happened here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history... It looks like your promotional pricing expired. You were on a twelve-month promotional rate that ended on the... let me see... the 15th of last month.

Customer: What? I didn't agree to that expiring. Nobody told me about this.

Agent: I completely understand. These promotional periods can definitely be confusing. Let me explain what happened. You signed up for our Fiber 200 plan back in November of 2022, and that came with a promotional rate of $89.99 per month for the first year. Once that year ended, your rate would have adjusted to our standard rate, which is $139.99.

Customer: So you're saying you guys just... changed my rate without telling me? That doesn't seem right. I should have gotten something in the mail or an email or something.

Agent: (pause) You know, that's a fair point. Let me check if there's a note on your account about a courtesy notification... (typing sounds) I'm not seeing a record of an outbound notification sent to you, so I apologize for that. That's something we should have communicated better.

Customer: Yeah, exactly. I mean, I've been a customer for like... what is it now, almost two years? And I'm loyal to you guys. My service has been great, but this is kind of a bait and switch situation, you know?

Agent: I completely hear you, and I appreciate your loyalty. This isn't the kind of experience we want for our customers. Let me see what I can do to help make this right. (pause) Okay, so I have a few options here. I can potentially get you back on a promotional rate for another year if you'd like. That would bring you back down to around $99.99 per month for the next twelve months, which gives you a slight increase from before, but still a significant savings from the $139.99.

Customer: Hmm... $99.99? That's still ten more than what I was paying.

Agent: I understand. The reason for the small increase is that we've made some infrastructure improvements in your area, and we're also offering faster speeds on that plan now. But yes, you're right that it is still higher. Let me see if there's anything else I can do... (typing sounds) I do see that I can possibly waive the overage charges for this month. So instead of being charged the full $139.99, I could credit you back about thirty dollars for this billing cycle as a gesture of goodwill, and then get you set up on that new promotional rate starting next month.

Customer: (pause) So you're saying I'd get thirty dollars back on this bill, and then next month would be $99.99?

Agent: That's exactly right. And that promotional rate would be locked in for the next twelve months, so you won't have any surprises like this again.

Customer: Okay, that's... that's better. But I'm still not thrilled about this whole thing. This should have been communicated to me upfront.

Agent: You're absolutely right, David, and I genuinely apologize. I'm going to make a note on your account about this as well, so if there's ever a question down the line, we have a record of this conversation and the adjustment we made. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your service?

Customer: No, that's... I think that's it. Just, you know, maybe improve your notification system or something. It would save you guys these calls.

Agent: (slight laugh) That's actually really good feedback, and I'm going to pass that along to my supervisor. I really do appreciate you bringing this to our attention. So to recap, you'll see a thirty-dollar credit on your current bill, and starting next month your rate will be $99.99 for the next twelve months. Is there a good email address on file where I can send you a confirmation of this?

Customer: Yeah, it should be [inaudible]@gmail.com. That's D-C-Chen.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm going to send that confirmation right over to you. You should receive it within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's good. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier, David, and again, I apologize for the confusion. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
