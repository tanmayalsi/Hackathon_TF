# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um... I'm calling because I got my bill this morning and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I think there's been some kind of mistake.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment here... and can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I'm pulling up your account right now. (pause) Got it. I can see your most recent bill from this month. What charge are you seeing that concerns you?

Customer: Well, there's... okay, so my bill was $79.99 a month, right? That's what I've been paying since I signed up last year. But this month it jumped to $109.99. That's like thirty dollars more. I never authorized any upgrade or anything like that.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Michael. Let me take a look at what might have caused that increase. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history here. I can see that... ah, yes. So your promotional rate expired. You were on our Frontier Fiber 500 plan with a promotional pricing of $79.99 per month for the first twelve months.

Customer: Right, but... I mean, nobody told me the price was going to go up that much. It's like double what I was paying.

Agent: I completely understand. So the promotional period has ended, which is why your rate adjusted to the regular pricing of $109.99 per month for that same plan.

Customer: That doesn't seem right though. I feel like that should've been communicated to me better. Like, I should've gotten a notice or something before they just... jacked up the price.

Agent: (pause) That's a fair point, and I apologize for any confusion there. Let me see what I can do to help. Do you still have the promotional materials or welcome packet we sent you when you signed up?

Customer: Umm... probably. It's somewhere around here. Why?

Agent: The terms of the promotion should be outlined in there, and it will show the dates. But I can also explain what I'm seeing on my end. Your promotion was set to expire on September 15th of this year. Typically, we do send a courtesy notification about 30 days before that happens, but let me check if that was sent to your account.

Customer: (pause) Well, I might not have seen it if it was an email. I get a lot of emails...

Agent: That could be it. Would you prefer us to send future notifications via postal mail instead? I can make that note on your account.

Customer: Um, maybe. But I mean, what am I supposed to do about this charge now? It's already on my bill.

Agent: Well, here's what I can do for you. While you're still within our retention policy, I can apply a discount to bring your rate back down. I don't have access to the full promotional pricing anymore, but I can offer you $89.99 per month for the next twelve months. That would be a $20 savings from your current rate and give you some time to think about what you'd like to do long-term.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) So that's still more than the $79.99 I was paying, but... I guess that's better than $109.99.

Agent: Right. And honestly, the regular retail price for that plan is $119.99 in most areas, so this is a pretty solid rate.

Customer: Wait, so you're saying the regular price is even higher than $109.99?

Agent: Yes, sir. The $109.99 is our standard pricing for that plan. The $119.99 I'm referencing is if you were to go through our website without any current offers. So this $89.99 would be our way of keeping you as a valued customer.

Customer: Okay... I mean, I don't love it, but I guess I'll take that deal. What do I need to do?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great. Let me just apply that to your account right now. I'm going to update your plan to reflect the new rate of $89.99 per month going forward. This will take effect on your next billing cycle.

Customer: So what about this month? Do I get a credit or something?

Agent: That's a good question. Unfortunately, since you're already in the billing cycle, I can't retroactively adjust this month's charge. However, what I can do is apply a one-time courtesy credit of $20 to your account to help offset some of that increase. How does that sound?

Customer: (sighs) I guess... yeah, okay. At least that helps a little bit.

Agent: Excellent. I'm applying that right now. So to recap, you'll get a $20 credit on your account, your rate will be adjusted to $89.99 per month starting next month, and that rate is locked in for the next twelve months.

Customer: Alright. And you're going to update my notifications to... postal mail, right?

Agent: I absolutely can do that. Let me just make a note on your account here. (typing sounds) Okay, I've updated your communication preferences so you'll receive courtesy notices via postal mail 30 days before any rate changes in the future. You'll get that at the address we have on file, which is... 447 Maple Street, Apartment 3B?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Michael?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. I appreciate your help.

Agent: You're very welcome. I really appreciate your patience, and I'm sorry again for the confusion on the rate change. Your account is all set now. If you need anything in the future, you have a great day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
