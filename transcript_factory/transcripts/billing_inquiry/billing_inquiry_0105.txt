Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm looking at a charge that I don't recognize. It's... it's like twenty-five dollars more than what I've been paying, and I want to know what that's about.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment while I pull that up. (pause) Alright, I've got your account here. Your name is David Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're seeing an increase on your bill? Let me take a look at what's showing here. (typing sounds) Okay, I can see your account. You've been on our Frontier Fiber 500 plan for... looks like about eighteen months now, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. I signed up for that promotional rate when we first moved to the area.

Agent: Got it. So I'm looking at your recent charges here, and I do see that your monthly service charge has increased from $79.99 to $104.99. Is that the charge you're concerned about?

Customer: Yes! Exactly. That's the one. Why did it jump up like that? Nobody called me or told me anything about this. I thought I was locked in at that price.

Agent: I understand your frustration, and I apologize that you weren't notified beforehand. Let me explain what happened here. (pause) Your promotional pricing period ended on your renewal date, which according to my notes was this month. So your account has moved to our standard pricing for the Fiber 500 plan.

Customer: Wait, so the promotional period is just... over? How long was I supposed to have that for?

Agent: (typing sounds) Looking at your agreement from when you signed up, the promotional rate was valid for twelve months from your activation date. After that twelve-month period, the rate adjusts to our standard rate, which is currently $104.99 per month for that speed tier.

Customer: Twelve months? I'm pretty sure it was supposed to be longer than that. And I wasn't told anything about this. You guys should have sent me a notice or something.

Agent: You know, that's a fair point, and I apologize for the lack of communication there. We do send out notifications, but I understand that things can get lost or missed. (pause) Let me see what options I have available for you here.

Customer: I mean, I really like the service, Marcus. The internet has been great. It's fast and reliable, but I can't just absorb a twenty-five dollar increase without knowing about it beforehand.

Agent: I completely understand. You know, because you've been a loyal customer for eighteen months and you've had a clean payment history, let me check if I can offer you an alternative plan or some kind of adjustment. (typing sounds) Okay, so... I'm seeing that we do have another option. We have our Fiber 300 plan, which would be $69.99 per month. That would actually be lower than your original promotional rate.

Customer: But that's a slower speed, right?

Agent: Yes, it would be 300 megabits per second instead of 500. Would that be adequate for your needs?

Customer: (pause) I... I don't know. I've gotten used to the 500. What about... is there any way you could extend some kind of promotional rate or discount for me since I've been a good customer?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds, pause) Alright, so I can offer you a six-month promotional rate on your current Fiber 500 plan. I can bring it down to $89.99 per month for the next six months. After that, it would go back to the standard $104.99. Would that work better for you?

Customer: So it's still an increase from what I was paying before, but... (pause) ...it's better than the full jump. How much total would that save me over the six months?

Agent: Let me do that math for you real quick. (pause) So you'd be saving about fifteen dollars per month compared to the full standard rate. That's ninety dollars over the six-month period.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Yeah, I think I can work with that. But can I ask... what happens after those six months? I'm not going to get another surprise in my mailbox, am I?

Agent: That's a fair question. So after the six-month promotional period ends, your rate would return to the standard $104.99 unless we have another promotional offer at that time. But I'll make a note on your account, and I'd recommend giving us a call about thirty days before that period ends so we can discuss your options.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. Can you also make a note that you guys need to send me better notification next time? Like, a phone call or an email, not just a bill slip?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to add that to your account right now. (typing sounds) Done. So I've applied the six-month promotional rate to your account, and I've added a note that you prefer direct notification via email or phone for any future changes to your account. The new rate of $89.99 will appear on your next billing cycle, which starts... (pause) ...on the 15th.

Customer: Okay, great. And just to confirm, it's the Fiber 500 speed, right?

Agent: Yes, you'll keep the same 500 megabit speed. No changes to your service, just the rate adjustment. (pause) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for working with me on this, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and if you have any other questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
