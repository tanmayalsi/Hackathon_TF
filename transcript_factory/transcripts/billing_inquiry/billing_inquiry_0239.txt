Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that shouldn't be there. I mean, I've been a customer for like three years and I've never seen this before.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having billing concerns. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Alright, I've got you in the system. Your name is Patricia Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And which charge are you concerned about, Patricia?

Customer: Well, it's... okay, so my regular bill is usually around $89 a month for the internet service, right? And this month it jumped to $119. That's like a $30 increase out of nowhere. I didn't sign up for anything extra, and I'm just wondering what that's about.

Agent: (pause) I understand that's frustrating. Let me take a look at what's on your account here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing... yes, I do see that increase. Let me check your service details. Are you still on our Gigabit plan?

Customer: Yes, I am. And I've been on it the whole time. My bill hasn't changed in like two years, and now suddenly it goes up $30?

Agent: Right, I see what you're saying. So it looks like... (pause) ...your promotional pricing period has ended. You were on an introductory rate of $89 a month for 24 months, and that promotion expired as of this billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about that. I mean, I would've... I don't know, this is the first I'm hearing about it.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Patricia. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) It looks like we did send out a notification about the rate change approximately 30 days before it took effect. Let me check... yes, it shows a notice was sent on March 15th for an effective date of April 15th.

Customer: I... I don't think I got that. Maybe it went to spam or something? I check my emails pretty regularly, but I might've missed it. But still, that seems kind of unfair to just jack up the price like that without at least, I don't know, calling me or something.

Agent: You know, I hear you, and I do apologize for the inconvenience. Promotional periods do eventually expire, but I understand you'd like a heads-up. Let me see what options we have available for you. (pause, typing sounds) 

Customer: Okay, so what... is there anything you can do? Like, can you put me back on that rate, or...?

Agent: Well, I don't have the ability to reinstate the previous promotion since it was for new customers, but I do have a couple of things I can look at. I can check if there are any current promotions available for existing customers that might help lower your bill. Give me just one moment... (typing sounds)

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: (pause) Alright, so I'm not seeing any standard promotions available right now for your area, but I do have access to a loyalty discount that I can apply to your account. This would bring your rate down from $119 to $104 per month for the next 12 months.

Customer: So it'd still be $15 more than what I was paying?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. I know it's not ideal, but it would be a $15 savings compared to the current rate. And honestly, that's the best option I have available in my system right now.

Customer: (sighs) Hmm. Well, I... I guess I'd rather have something than nothing, but I'm not thrilled about it. Can you... I mean, is there any way you could do better? Like, I've been a loyal customer and I've never had any problems with the service.

Agent: I absolutely appreciate your loyalty, Patricia. (pause) Let me see... I'm going to check with my supervisor to see if we have any additional flexibility here. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Sure.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, then returns) Thank you for holding. I spoke with my supervisor, and we do have the ability to extend that loyalty rate for 18 months instead of 12. So you'd be looking at $104 a month for a year and a half, and then after that point, if you call back before that period expires, we can discuss renewal options at that time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so 18 months at $104?

Agent: That's right. That would save you $270 over that period compared to the standard rate.

Customer: Yeah, I mean... that's better than nothing, I guess. Okay, let's do that.

Agent: Great, I appreciate you working with us, Patricia. Let me get that applied to your account right now. (typing sounds) And I'm also going to add a note here about the promotional period change so that we make sure to reach out to you directly when this rate is coming up for renewal.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I appreciate that.

Agent: You're welcome. So you should see this adjustment reflected on your next billing cycle. Your new rate of $104 will start with your May bill. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's everything. Thank you for helping me out with this.

Agent: My pleasure. And again, I apologize for any inconvenience with that rate increase. We really do value your business, and we're glad to have you as a customer. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's good. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, Patricia. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great one.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
