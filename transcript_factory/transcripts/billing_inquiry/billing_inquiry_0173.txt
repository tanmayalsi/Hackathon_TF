# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. Can I have your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... it's 555-0147. My name is Sarah Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. Thank you. Let me pull that up here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account for you in Portland, Oregon. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. And what can I help you with today?

Customer: Well, I got my bill yesterday and I'm really frustrated. My internet bill went up by like thirty dollars a month. I've been with Frontier for four years and I've never had any issues, but this is... this is just ridiculous. I want to know why I'm being charged more.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Sarah. Price increases can definitely be surprising. Let me look into that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your billing history here. Can you tell me what your bill was the previous month?

Customer: It was... I think around seventy-nine dollars? And this month it's one hundred and nine. That's a thirty dollar jump overnight. I didn't authorize any changes to my service or anything.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm seeing that here. So your account was on our standard Fiber 300 plan at $79.99, and as of this month you were moved to our Fiber 500 plan at $109.99. Do you... do you remember making that change?

Customer: No, absolutely not. I never called to upgrade. Why would I upgrade if I didn't ask for it? I use the internet just fine. I don't need faster speeds. This doesn't make any sense.

Agent: I hear you. Let me check your account notes here to see if there's any record of... (typing sounds) ...okay, so it looks like there was a promotional rate that you were on. You had an introductory rate that expired on the 20th of last month. When promotional rates expire, customers are automatically moved to our standard tier for that speed level, which is the Fiber 500 plan.

Customer: Wait, wait. So you're telling me that I was on some kind of deal and you just... automatically upgraded me without asking? That doesn't seem right. Why would you do that?

Agent: I understand why that's confusing. So typically, customers are informed about promotional rates expiring through mail and email notifications. Let me check what... (typing sounds) ...yes, we did send out a notification on March 15th to the email address on file, which is [inaudible]. Did you receive that?

Customer: I mean, I get a lot of emails. I probably saw it, but I didn't read it carefully, to be honest. But that's the thing—nobody called me or anything. You just switched my service without my permission.

Agent: I understand your concern, Sarah. And I hear what you're saying. Unfortunately, the promotional rate was for a limited time—it was a two-year promotional rate that ended—but I can definitely help you here. (pause) Let me see what options I have available for you.

Customer: Okay, because I really can't afford an extra thirty dollars a month right now. I'm on a pretty tight budget.

Agent: Absolutely. I appreciate that. So, I have a couple of options. First, I can move you back to the Fiber 300 plan if you don't need the faster speeds. That would bring your bill back down to the regular rate of $84.99 for that tier. That's not quite the original promotional rate, but it's closer to what you were paying.

Customer: (pause) So I can't get the promotional rate back?

Agent: Let me see... (typing sounds) ...unfortunately the promotional period has ended, so I'm not able to reapply that specific promo. However, I do see that we have a new promotion running right now for existing customers. I could actually... hold on one second. (brief hold, background music) ...okay, I'm back. So I can offer you the Fiber 500 plan—which is the faster speed you're currently on—at $89.99 for the next twelve months. That would save you twenty dollars a month compared to the regular rate.

Customer: So I'd stay on the faster internet for less than what I'm paying now?

Agent: Exactly. It would be $89.99 a month for twelve months. And at the end of that period, we can look at what options are available at that time.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Well, that's... that's better, I guess. But I'm still frustrated that I wasn't contacted directly about this. Don't you have my phone number?

Agent: We do have your phone number on file. You're right that we could have made an outbound call, and I understand that would have been more helpful. That's good feedback. For future rate changes, I can add a note to your account requesting outbound notification calls as well as email. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yeah, actually, that would be great. If you're going to mess with my bill, the least you can do is call me about it.

Agent: Absolutely fair. (typing sounds) I've added that to your account notes right now. So, just to confirm—you'd like me to apply the new promotion for Fiber 500 at $89.99 per month for twelve months?

Customer: Yes, okay. Do that.

Agent: Perfect. And I'm going to credit your account for the difference between what you were charged this month and what the promotional rate should have been. That's a $20 credit, which should appear on your next bill.

Customer: Oh, okay. That's... that's good. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. So this credit should show up within 24 hours, and your new promotional rate will be effective immediately. So starting your next billing cycle, you should see the $89.99 charge. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course, Sarah. And again, I'm sorry for the confusion with the rate change. I really do appreciate your four years of loyalty with Frontier, and we want to make sure you're taken care of. If you have any issues at all, please don't hesitate to call us back.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: You have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye!
