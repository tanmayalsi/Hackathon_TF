Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that doesn't make any sense. I need to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having an issue with your bill. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment please... Alright, I've got your account here. It's under the name David Castellanos, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned there's a charge you'd like to dispute. Can you tell me which charge is concerning you?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill jumped up like thirty bucks this month. I was paying $79.99 for the Fiber 100 plan, and now it's showing $109.99. I never agreed to anything like that. What's going on?

Agent: I understand that's frustrating, Mr. Castellanos. Let me pull up your account details here... (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your billing history. It appears that you had a promotional rate that expired. Your account shows you've been on that $79.99 promotional pricing for... looks like about eighteen months now.

Customer: Right, but nobody told me the price was going to go up. I got no notification or anything. That's not fair.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Those promotional rates do have an expiration date, and typically customers are notified through email or mail before the rate changes. (pause) Let me check if we have a current email address on file for you.

Customer: I didn't get any email. I would've remembered that. And I didn't get anything in the mail either.

Agent: (typing sounds) I see the email address we have is david.castellanos82@... is that still current?

Customer: Yeah, that's the right email, but like I said, I didn't get anything.

Agent: Hmm, that's odd. Well, I apologize for that. Sometimes emails can end up in spam folders, but regardless, I understand this is frustrating for you. The good news is that I can look into what options we have available. What I'm seeing here is that the current rate for the Fiber 100 plan in your area is $109.99 per month. However... (pause) let me see what I can do for you.

Customer: Can you just put me back on the $79.99 plan? I mean, I was happy with that price. There's no reason to charge me more.

Agent: I wish I could extend that promotional rate indefinitely, but unfortunately once a promotion expires, I'm not able to reinstate it retroactively. However, what I can do is offer you a different promotion. We have a current offer for new or renewing customers—it's Fiber 100 at $84.99 for the first twelve months. After that, it would go to the standard rate of $109.99.

Customer: So you're offering me five dollars cheaper than before, and then in a year I'm back to one hundred and nine ninety-nine? That's not really a solution here, Derek.

Agent: I understand, and I hear your frustration. (pause) Let me see what else I can do. Do you have any other services with us? Are you also a phone or TV customer?

Customer: No, just the internet. I use that streaming stuff instead.

Agent: Okay, I see that. So, Mr. Castellanos, what I can do for you is... let me put you on a slightly different promotional package. We have a loyalty offer for existing customers. I can get you on the Fiber 100 plan at $89.99 per month for the next twenty-four months. That's a significant discount compared to the standard rate, and it would be locked in for two years, so you won't have any surprises.

Customer: (pause) So that's ten dollars more than what I was paying, but it's locked in for two years?

Agent: That's correct, yes.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) I mean... that's still not ideal, but I guess that's better than going up to one-ten. Can you do ninety-nine cents instead of ninety-nine ninety-nine? (chuckles)

Agent: (chuckles) I appreciate the negotiation attempt, Mr. Castellanos. Unfortunately, $89.99 is the best rate I can offer you on that plan. But I can tell you that rate is locked in for the full twenty-four months, and there will be no surprises charges during that time.

Customer: Alright, fine. Let's do that. But I want this in writing. I don't want to get another bill in a couple years and have this happen again.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to apply this rate to your account right now, and I'll send you a confirmation email within the next couple of hours with all the details of your new plan and the promotional terms. That way you'll have everything documented.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm updating your account now... The new rate of $89.99 per month will be effective on your next billing cycle, which would be... (pause) June 3rd. So you'll see this reflected on your next bill.

Customer: Wait, so I'm still being charged the higher rate this month?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. The billing cycle that already generated has the charges at the previous rate. However, I can see if there's anything I can do about this month's bill. Let me check with my supervisor on that... (pause) Actually, what I can do is apply a one-time billing adjustment of $20 to your account as a courtesy for the inconvenience. That'll help offset this month's overage.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I mean... that helps. Can you do thirty?

Agent: I can do the twenty as a one-time courtesy adjustment. That's the maximum I'm authorized to offer.

Customer: Alright, alright. I'll take it. So that brings this month's bill to what?

Agent: So your bill this month was $109.99, and I'm applying a $20 credit, so you'll owe $89.99 for this billing cycle. And then starting next month, all subsequent bills will be $89.99 with the new rate locked in for twenty-four months.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, that's... that works. I appreciate you working with me on this, Derek.

Agent: My pleasure, Mr. Castellanos. I'm sorry again about the confusion with the notification. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: Great. You should receive that confirmation email shortly. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
