# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um... I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and I'm also pretty upset about my internet bill in general because it went up like thirty dollars this month.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having billing concerns. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... hold on, let me find my bill here... okay, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Jennifer Martinez. M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, Jennifer. I've got your account here. So you mentioned two concerns—a price increase and an unrecognized charge. Let me start by walking you through what I'm seeing on your current bill. It looks like your billing cycle ended on the 18th. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right.

Agent: Okay, so I'm seeing your standard internet service is $59.99. That's our standard 500 Mbps Fiber package. And then you have our equipment rental at $12.99. But I'm also seeing a one-time charge for $29.95 here. Does that look familiar to you?

Customer: No, that's... that's definitely not something I authorized. What is that for?

Agent: (typing) Let me check the description here. It says "Service Visit—Technician Dispatch." Did you have a technician come out to your home recently?

Customer: Oh... yeah, actually, we did. About two weeks ago. But I thought that was covered because the internet was going out constantly, and I thought that was—

Agent: I understand. So the technician did come out to your place, and they charged you for that visit. Now, was the outage issue caused by something on your end, or was it determined to be a Frontier network issue?

Customer: Um, I don't really remember the technician explaining it very well. They were here for like fifteen minutes, and they just said something about the signal and... I don't know, they kind of rushed through it. Can you tell me why I'm being charged for this?

Agent: (pause) Let me see if I can pull up the work order from that visit. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing the technician noted that the issue was a loose connection at the modem connection point. They tightened it and verified service was restored. So the charge here is for the service visit itself.

Customer: But that doesn't really seem fair. I mean, I was just calling to report that my service wasn't working. I didn't ask for a technician. You people sent them out.

Agent: I hear your frustration, Jennifer. Let me explain how this typically works. Service visits are complimentary if the issue is determined to be on Frontier's infrastructure. However, if the issue is determined to be equipment-related or user-related, like in this case with a loose connection at the modem, there is a $29.95 service charge for the diagnostic visit.

Customer: That seems kind of ridiculous. I didn't loosen the connection. Why would I do that?

Agent: That's a fair point. And I can see why you'd be frustrated. You know what, let me escalate this and see if I can get this charge waived for you. Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: (background noise of rustling) Yeah, okay, fine.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, then returns after about 45 seconds) Jennifer, I'm back. I've looked into your account history, and I can see that you've been a loyal customer for... wow, three years with us. Because of your account standing and the circumstances, I'm able to remove that $29.95 charge from your bill. It won't appear on your next statement.

Customer: Oh. Well... okay, that's good. Thank you. But I still want to talk about the price increase. That's the bigger issue here.

Agent: Absolutely, let's address that. You mentioned your bill went up about thirty dollars. Let me walk you through what changed. Back in September, you were on a promotional rate of $39.99 for the first year. That promotion expired at the end of your billing cycle on the 18th of this month, and you've now moved to our standard rate of $59.99.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't agree to that. I mean, I knew there was a promotional period, but I feel like I should have been notified before they just... increased it.

Agent: You know, that's actually a really good point. We should have sent you a notification. Let me check if we sent anything to your email on file. (typing) What email do we have for you?

Customer: It's jmartinez1982@mailprovider.com.

Agent: (typing and pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing a notification sent to that email. That's our mistake. I apologize for that. Here's what I can do for you. I can offer you an extension on our promotional rate. I can extend the $39.99 rate for an additional six months, and then we can revisit your service at that time to see if there are any other packages that might work better for you.

Customer: Really? Six months?

Agent: Yes. I can apply that starting with your next billing cycle. So instead of the jump to $59.99, you'll stay at $39.99. And at the end of those six months, we can talk about what options work best for you.

Customer: I... okay, that's actually much better. I appreciate that. Can I ask, though—is there any chance I could get a rate after the six months? Like, a permanent rate that's lower than $59.99?

Agent: That's a good question. I don't want to promise something I can't deliver, but absolutely, when those six months are up, call us back, and I'll make sure your case is noted so you can speak with someone about loyalty rates. We do have options for long-term customers, and after the extension, you'll definitely qualify to discuss those.

Customer: Okay. That actually sounds fair. So let me make sure I understand—the $29.95 charge is being removed, and my rate is staying at $39.99 for the next six months instead of jumping to $59.99?

Agent: (typing) That's exactly right. I've just applied both of those changes to your account. You should see the credit for the service charge appear within one to two billing cycles, and your next bill will reflect the promotional rate.

Customer: Great. I really appreciate you working with me on this, Marcus.

Agent: My pleasure, Jennifer. I'm glad we could resolve this. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thank you.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I apologize again for not sending you that notification before the rate change. We appreciate your business, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any issues in the future.

Customer: Okay, I will. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, Jennifer. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.
