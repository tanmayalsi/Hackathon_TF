Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my monthly rate went up. I've been with Frontier for like three years and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having billing concerns. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... and I'm just going to verify a couple details with you. Is this account under the name James Patterson?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great, thank you. And what's the best callback number if we get disconnected?

Customer: Same number, 555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so I'm looking at your account here. I can see your current bill for this month is $89.99. I'm showing that your previous bill was $79.99, so there is a $10 increase. Can you tell me what the unrecognized charge you're referring to is?

Customer: Well, that's actually part of the problem. Your bill is really confusing. There's like three different line items now that weren't there before. One says "Fiber Infrastructure Fee" for $5.99, and then there's something called a "Modem Lease Fee" for $4.99. I never leased a modem from you guys. I bought my own modem like two years ago.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I understand your frustration. Let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) So, the Fiber Infrastructure Fee is actually something that was recently implemented across our service area. It helps us maintain and upgrade the network infrastructure. That's the $5.99 you're seeing.

Customer: Wait, wait—so you're just adding new fees without telling anyone? I didn't authorize that.

Agent: I understand this is frustrating. Those new fees would have been communicated via a bill insert about 30 days ago. Did you receive anything in the mail with your bill around that time?

Customer: (sighs) I... maybe? I don't really read that stuff, honestly. But that doesn't mean I agreed to it.

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately, that fee is, um, it's standard across all our customers in your region now, so I'm not able to remove that one. However, the modem lease fee—that's something I can absolutely look into. You mentioned you have your own modem?

Customer: Yeah, I bought a NETGEAR modem from Best Buy like two years ago. It's been working fine this whole time.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so what I'm seeing in the system is that you're currently being charged for a modem lease, which suggests our records show we provided you with equipment. Do you happen to have that original NETGEAR modem still?

Customer: Yeah, it's right here next to me. I'm looking at it now.

Agent: Perfect. So here's what I can do. I'm going to submit a request to our equipment team to remove that modem lease fee from your account. Since you have your own equipment and it's been working properly, you shouldn't be charged for ours. That should save you that $4.99 a month going forward.

Customer: Okay, um... so when will that be removed? Will it be off next month's bill?

Agent: (pause) So the request will go to our team, and they typically process those within one to two business days. Once they confirm you don't have our equipment, the fee will be removed from your next billing cycle. You should see it off your September bill.

Customer: Alright. What about the infrastructure fee? Can you really not do anything about that?

Agent: Unfortunately, that fee is something we've had to implement company-wide to help support network maintenance and upgrades. I'm not able to waive it or remove it from the account. However, if you'd like, I can review your current plan to see if there's a different package that might better fit your needs or budget.

Customer: (sighs) How much would that save me? And what's my current plan?

Agent: (typing sounds) You're currently on our Frontier Fiber 300 plan at $79.99 before the new fees. We do have a Fiber 100 option at $59.99 a month, which would give you 100 megabits per second download speed instead of 300. Would that work for you?

Customer: No, no. I need the speed. I work from home and I'm on Zoom calls all day. I can't downgrade.

Agent: I totally understand. In that case, unfortunately the Fiber 300 is our best option for you, and it comes with those new fees I mentioned. But, I will note on your account that you've been a loyal customer for three years, and I'm going to add a $10 service credit to your account for this month as a goodwill gesture. That should offset the rate increase you're seeing this time around.

Customer: Oh... okay. Well, that helps a little bit. So to confirm, the modem fee goes away next month?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. I'm submitting that request right now. (typing sounds) And the service credit of $10 will show up on your September bill as well. So your bill next month should be $89.99 minus the $4.99 modem fee, which would be $84.99, and then you'll also see that $10 credit applied. So you're looking at roughly $74.99 for next month.

Customer: Okay, that's better. I appreciate that. So I should just... wait and see it on my next bill?

Agent: Exactly. You'll see both adjustments reflected on your September statement. But if for any reason the modem fee is still there, just give us a call back and reference this conversation, and we can follow up on that request.

Customer: Alright. Thank you. I mean, I'm still not thrilled about the new fees, but this helps.

Agent: I completely understand, and I appreciate your patience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Great. Thanks so much for being a Frontier customer, and I apologize again for the confusion on the bill. You should be all set. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
