# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I was told my rate was locked in, and now it's gone up like thirty bucks.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with your bill. Let me pull up your account and take a look at what's going on. Can I get the phone number or account number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now... and I've got you here. I see your account under Michael Torres. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned a price increase? Let me just review your billing history here. (pause) Okay, I can see what happened. You were on our promotional rate of $59.99 per month for twelve months, and that promotional period ended last month. So your rate has adjusted to our standard rate of $89.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. Nobody told me my rate was only good for twelve months. I thought it was locked in permanently. I mean, I've been with you guys for like two years now.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me check the notes on your account. (typing sounds) So I'm seeing here that the promotional rate was applied when you signed up, and according to the terms and conditions—

Customer: —I didn't read any terms and conditions. The guy who sold me the service said my rate would be locked in. He specifically said I wouldn't have to worry about price increases.

Agent: I hear you, and I apologize if there was any miscommunication when you signed up. Unfortunately, promotional rates do have an end date, and it looks like yours was set for twelve months from your installation date. Once the promo period ends, your account moves to the standard rate. But the good news is that I may have some options for you.

Customer: Okay, what kind of options? Because thirty dollars more a month is... that's like four hundred bucks a year. That's a lot.

Agent: Absolutely, I understand. Let me see what I can do here. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at our current promotions. We do have a retention offer available. I could apply a discounted rate of $74.99 per month for the next twelve months. That would be a fifteen-dollar discount off the standard rate, so you'd be paying about fifteen dollars more than what you were paying before.

Customer: Hmm. So instead of ninety dollars, you're offering me seventy-five?

Agent: That's correct, yes. $74.99, to be exact. And this rate would be locked in for twelve months from today.

Customer: What happens after twelve months? It goes back up again?

Agent: Well, after this promotional period ends, we would work with you to find another option at that time. But for now, this would give you some stability for the next year.

Customer: I don't know... this still feels like I'm getting the short end of the stick. When I signed up, I really thought the rate was permanent. Is there any way you could make it more like sixty-five or seventy?

Agent: (pause) Let me check with my supervisor to see if there's any flexibility on this offer. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Sure.

Agent: (hold music plays, then stops) Thank you for holding. I spoke with my supervisor, and unfortunately, the $74.99 is the best promotional rate I'm able to offer at this time. However, what I can do is waive any service fees for the next two months—that's usually about thirty dollars in fees—and I can also send you a service credit of twenty-five dollars that will be applied to your account immediately.

Customer: (pause) So... that's like a fifty-five dollar credit basically?

Agent: Between the waived fees and the credit, yes, that's approximately fifty-five dollars in savings right away. Plus you'd get the discounted rate locked in for the next year.

Customer: Okay, fine. I appreciate that. I'm still frustrated, but I guess I'll take it. Can you just make sure I don't get surprised again? Like, maybe send me a notice before my rate changes next time?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll make a note on your account right now requesting that we send you an advance notification before any rate adjustments. That way you'll have time to review your options. And I'm going to go ahead and apply the $74.99 promotional rate, the twenty-five dollar credit, and waive those service fees. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. When will these changes show up on my bill?

Agent: The promotional rate and the credit should be reflected on your next billing cycle, which would be around the [inaudible] of next month. You should see everything updated. And I've added that flag to your account about the advance notification, so you'll receive a call or email about sixty days before your rate period is set to expire.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I apologize again for the confusion with your rate. We really do appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Have a great day!
