# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Actually, no—I recognize it, but I'm really upset about it. My bill went up like thirty dollars out of nowhere.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the number on the bill.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's David Hernandez. H-E-R-N-A-N-D-E-Z.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm pulling that up right now. (pause) Okay, I've got your account here, David. I can see your bill from this month. Let me just review the charges... so I'm looking at your statement. Can you tell me which charge is concerning you?

Customer: The whole thing is concerning me! My internet speed package went from $79.99 to $109.99. I didn't authorize that. I've been with you guys for like four years, and I've never had any issues, but this is... I mean, that's a thirty-dollar increase. That's ridiculous.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me look into what happened with your account. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I'm seeing here that you've been a customer since March 2020, and you've been on our 500 Mbps Fiber plan. Is that the service you're currently using?

Customer: Yeah, 500 Mbps. That's the one. Look, I don't remember getting any notice about a price increase. Did you guys send something out? Because I usually pay attention to this stuff.

Agent: That's a fair question. (typing sounds) So, looking at your account notes, it appears that your promotional pricing expired. You had an introductory rate for the first twelve months, and that period ended about two months ago. After that, your rate adjusted to our standard pricing for that speed tier.

Customer: Wait, wait. An introductory rate? I don't... I mean, maybe, but I should have gotten some kind of notification. I'm not sitting here reading the fine print on every email you guys send.

Agent: I absolutely hear you. And you know, that's feedback we hear. Let me see what I can do to help make this right. (pause) So, I'm going to be honest with you—we do typically send notifications about rate changes, usually about thirty days before they take effect. However, I want to make sure you're getting the best rate available to you. Let me check what promotions we currently have active.

Customer: Okay, because thirty dollars a month is a lot of money.

Agent: (typing sounds, longer pause) All right, so here's what I'm seeing. For your speed tier and your location, we currently have a promotion that would bring your rate down to $89.99 a month for the next twelve months. That's not quite back to your original $79.99, but it's a meaningful difference from the $109.99 you're paying now.

Customer: So I'm still paying ten more dollars than I was before?

Agent: Yes, unfortunately. What happened is your initial promotional period was quite aggressive—that was designed to attract new customers. But after that expires, we do adjust to our standard rates. However, we do try to re-engage customers with new promotions to keep them competitive.

Customer: (sighs) This is frustrating. Why couldn't you guys have just told me this was coming? I mean, if I'd known, I could have... I don't know, looked around at other providers or something.

Agent: I understand your frustration, and I'm sorry that the notification wasn't as clear as it should have been. You know what? Let me see if I can do a little bit better for you. (typing sounds, pause) David, I'm going to apply a courtesy credit of forty dollars to your account to cover the difference for this billing cycle and next month. And then I can set you up with that $89.99 rate going forward for the next twelve months.

Customer: (pause) Forty dollars? That covers... okay, so that's basically bringing me back down for two months. But what happens after the year is up? Am I just going to get hit with another increase?

Agent: That's an excellent question, and I appreciate you asking it. Honestly, I can't predict what rates will be in twelve months. What I would recommend is that you reach out to us at least a month before that promotion ends so we can discuss available options at that time. You might have new promotions available, or we might have new speed tiers that offer better value. But I can add a note to your account right now to flag this, and you can also call back in whenever you want to check on current promotions.

Customer: Okay, so... the forty-dollar credit is happening today?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, I'm processing that right now. It should show up on your account within the next billing cycle, so probably by tomorrow or the day after. And the $89.99 rate will start on your next billing date, which looks like it's... (pause) March 15th.

Customer: Okay. Well, I guess that's better than nothing. I'm still not thrilled about the whole situation, but I appreciate you working with me on it.

Agent: I really do appreciate your patience, and I apologize that this wasn't handled more smoothly on the notification side. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Do you have any issues with your service itself?

Customer: No, actually, the service has been great. No complaints there. It's just the billing thing that's got me worked up.

Agent: I totally get it. Well, I'm glad to hear the service is working well for you. I'm going to send you a confirmation email with all the details of what we discussed today—the credit, the new rate, all of that. Just so you have it in writing. Is the email on the account still current?

Customer: Yeah, it should be. It's, um... [inaudible]... it's the one you have on file.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, that's all set. Is there anything else I can help you with today, David?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for working with me.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier, and I really appreciate your loyalty as a customer. If you need anything else in the future, feel free to give us a call back. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye, David.
