# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Actually, no—I recognize it, but it shouldn't be there.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And what's the best name to have on the account?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. And just to verify, the service address is 442 Oakwood Drive in Bozeman?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned there's a charge on your bill that's unexpected. What specifically are you seeing?

Customer: Well, I've been a customer for... gosh, I think about five years now? And my bill has always been pretty consistent. Like, $79.99 a month for my internet service. But this month it jumped to $94.99. That's a fifteen-dollar increase, and I have no idea why.

Agent: (pause) I understand, David. That is a noticeable jump. Let me take a look at your account here and see what might be going on. (typing sounds) Okay, so looking at your current plan, you're on our Standard Fiber 500 package. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one I signed up for originally.

Agent: Right. So it looks like... ah, I see what happened here. It appears that your promotional rate expired. You were on a special introductory offer for the first twelve months, and that period has ended. So you're now moving to our standard pricing for that package.

Customer: Wait, wait—I was never told about that. I mean, I didn't agree to some temporary rate. I thought that was just... that was the price.

Agent: I completely understand why that would be frustrating. Let me pull up the notes on your account from when you first signed up. (typing sounds) Okay, so according to our records from five years ago, the promotion was actually for twenty-four months, not twelve. So this shouldn't have kicked in yet.

Customer: See, so there's definitely an error then.

Agent: It does appear there may be an issue. Let me investigate this a little further. Can you hold for just one moment while I check with my supervisor on the best way to handle this?

Customer: Yeah, sure, I guess.

Agent: Thank you. (hold music plays for approximately 45 seconds) David? I'm back.

Customer: Okay, I'm here.

Agent: So I looked into this with my team, and what I found is that there was actually a system error on our end. Your promotional period should have extended through next month, in June. You shouldn't have been charged at this higher rate yet. I sincerely apologize for that.

Customer: Okay, so what does that mean? Are you going to fix it?

Agent: Absolutely. Here's what I can do for you. I'm going to credit your account the difference—that's the fifteen dollars you were overcharged this month. But I want to make sure we get your account sorted for the future as well. 

Customer: Alright, that's good. But what about next month? Am I going to get hit with the full increase then?

Agent: That's a great question. So yes, your promotional rate will expire next month, and you will see the increase take effect starting in July. However, what I can do is offer you an alternative. We actually have a new promotion running right now for existing customers. I can put you on our Fiber 750 package—that's a speed upgrade—for the same price you're paying now, $79.99 a month, for an additional twelve months.

Customer: (pause) Really? So I'd actually get faster internet and still pay the same price?

Agent: That's correct. You'd be going from 500 megabits per second to 750, and your bill would stay at $79.99 for the next year.

Customer: That's... actually not bad. Yeah, let's do that. Why didn't someone offer me this when my promotion was ending?

Agent: You know, that's a really fair point. Ideally, we should have reached out to you before this happened. I apologize that we didn't. Unfortunately, sometimes customers fall through the cracks with these transitions. But I'm glad we can get you sorted now.

Customer: Yeah, okay. So just to confirm—the fifteen dollars will be credited back, and then starting next month my bill is going to be $79.99 for the faster service?

Agent: (typing sounds) That's exactly right. I'm processing the credit now, and it should appear on your account within one to two billing cycles. And I'm updating your service to the Fiber 750 package effective June 1st. You'll see the speed upgrade take effect within the next 24 hours, and then starting with your July bill, you'll see the $79.99 rate.

Customer: Okay, perfect. Thank you for actually taking care of this.

Agent: It's my pleasure, David. And again, I apologize for the confusion and the error. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a valued Frontier customer, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
