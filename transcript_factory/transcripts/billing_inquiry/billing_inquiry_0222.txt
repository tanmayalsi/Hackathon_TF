Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my rate went up. I've been a customer for like three years and this is ridiculous.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147. And yeah, I just... I don't understand why my bill jumped up almost twenty dollars.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account now. One moment, please. (pause) Alright, I've got it here. I see your account under the name Sarah Chen. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Sarah. So I'm looking at your current bill, and I can see there was a rate adjustment that went into effect this billing cycle. Let me explain what happened. You've been on our promotional rate of $59.99 for internet for the past 36 months, and that promotion has ended. Your rate is now adjusting to our standard rate of $79.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. Nobody told me about this. I never signed up for any promotion that would end. That's not fair. I've been a loyal customer.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I appreciate your loyalty, Sarah. (pause) Let me look into this a bit more. These promotional periods are typically outlined in the service agreement, and we do send out notifications, but I want to check your account notes and see... (typing sounds) ...okay, I'm seeing that a notification was sent to your email approximately 60 days before the rate adjustment took effect.

Customer: I don't remember getting any email about this. I get so many emails. But that's still... I mean, that seems predatory. You'd think you'd call or something.

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate that feedback. That's valuable input for us. Unfortunately, email is our primary notification method, but I do want to help you find a solution here. Now, you also mentioned there was a charge you didn't recognize. Can you tell me which charge that is?

Customer: Yeah, there's a $49.99 charge labeled "equipment upgrade fee." I didn't ask for any equipment upgrade, and I didn't authorize this.

Agent: (pause) Let me take a look at that. (typing sounds) Hmm, okay, so I'm seeing that on August 15th, you received a new modem. Do you recall that?

Customer: I mean, I don't think I asked for it. When did it arrive?

Agent: According to our records, it was delivered on August 15th. Did you receive a package during that time?

Customer: (pause) ...Actually, now that you mention it, yes. I did get a package, but I thought it was something I ordered online. I didn't realize it was from Frontier. I've been using it for like two weeks now.

Agent: Okay, so it sounds like the modem was delivered and installed. The fee is associated with an equipment upgrade. Now, this is typically covered under our standard service, but I'm seeing here that this was flagged as a premium modem upgrade. Let me check if there was a promotional offer attached to this.

Customer: So are you saying I have to pay for this?

Agent: Well, let me investigate a bit more because I want to make sure this was authorized properly on our end. (typing sounds) Sarah, I'm not seeing any authorization in the notes for an equipment upgrade request from you. This appears to have been sent without your prior consent, which shouldn't have happened.

Customer: Exactly! I didn't ask for it.

Agent: Okay, I sincerely apologize for that error. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to remove that $49.99 equipment upgrade fee from your current bill as a courtesy. That's definitely on us.

Customer: Okay, well, that's good. But what about the rate increase? That's still happening?

Agent: (pause) Regarding the rate increase, that is the end of your promotional period, which is... I understand it's not ideal. However, I do have a few options I can present to you. First, I can check if you're eligible for any current promotional offers that might apply to your account.

Customer: You're going to do that, right?

Agent: Absolutely, let me see what we have available. (typing sounds) (longer pause) Okay, Sarah, so I'm looking at our current promotions for your area and service tier. We do have a promotion available, but I want to be transparent with you about the terms. We can offer you a rate of $69.99 per month for 24 months, which would be a $10 savings compared to our standard rate. After that period, it would adjust to the standard rate unless another promotion is available at that time.

Customer: So I still have to pay more than I'm paying now?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. The promotional rate you had was one of our introductory offers, and it's no longer available for existing customers. The $69.99 option would be a middle ground, but your current rate of $59.99 would not be available going forward, no.

Customer: Hmm... (pause) How long would I have to stay at that rate, though? The 24 months?

Agent: That's the promotional term, yes. So you'd be locked into that rate for 24 months. After that, you'd have the option to renew a promotion if available, or you'd go month-to-month at the standard rate, which could be different at that time. But you wouldn't be charged anything to switch.

Customer: Well, I mean... that's better than $79.99, I guess. And you're removing that $49.99 fee?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I'm removing that fee right now. Let me process that. (typing sounds) And I'm going to go ahead and apply the promotional rate of $69.99 for 24 months to your account. That will take effect with your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay. Alright. I... I guess that works. I'm still not happy about the whole situation, but that's better than where we started.

Agent: I really do appreciate your understanding, Sarah, and I apologize again for the confusion with the equipment charge and the lack of clarity around the promotional rate ending. We should have done a better job communicating that to you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap, I've removed the $49.99 equipment upgrade fee from your bill, and I've applied a promotional rate of $69.99 per month for the next 24 months. You should see that reflected in your next billing statement. We really appreciate your business, Sarah, and we hope to continue serving you.

Customer: Thanks, I guess. Bye.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day.
