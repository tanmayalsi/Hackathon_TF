# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. My internet bill just jumped up like forty dollars out of nowhere.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you figure out what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number tied to the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And can I get your name please?

Customer: It's James. James Mitchell.

Agent: (typing sounds) James Mitchell. Got it. Let me just pull up your account here... Okay, I'm looking at your most recent bill. I can see the charge you're referring to. It looks like your monthly service went from $79.99 to $119.99. Is that what you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, that's exactly it. Forty bucks more. I haven't done anything different. I didn't ask for any upgrades or anything. I just want to know why my bill went up like that.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, James. Let me look into this for you. (pause) It appears that your introductory pricing period has ended. You were on our promotional rate of $79.99 for twelve months, and that promotion expired with your last billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about that. I mean... I've been with you guys for how long? More than a year?

Agent: According to our records, you've been a customer since March of 2023, so yes, a little over two years now. The promotional pricing was for the first twelve months of service.

Customer: Okay, but like... shouldn't you have sent me a notice or something? An email or a letter? I just found out when I opened my bill yesterday.

Agent: That's a fair point. Let me check if a notification was sent to your account. (typing sounds) We do send notifications before promotional pricing ends, typically about thirty days in advance. It looks like we sent an email to the address on file on January 15th. Did you possibly receive that?

Customer: (pause) I mean, I get a lot of emails, so maybe it went into spam or something, but still... I wish I'd been more aware of it. So what are my options here? Am I stuck paying this new price?

Agent: Well, I appreciate you asking that. Let me look at what we can do. (pause) So, your current plan is our Fiber 300 service. With the current market rates, the standard pricing for that is actually $119.99, so you're now at our regular rate. However... give me just one second here. (typing sounds) I do have some options available to you. We have some promotional rates I can potentially apply.

Customer: Okay, like what?

Agent: Well, I can offer you a new promotion for six months at $99.99 per month, which would bring your bill down thirty dollars during that period. After six months, you'd go back to the standard rate of $119.99.

Customer: (sighs) So I'm just kicking the can down the road? In six months I'm back where I am now?

Agent: I understand this is frustrating. Let me see if there's anything else I can do. (pause) Actually, James, I'm going to check something else here. Are you still on a contract with us, or are you month-to-month?

Customer: I think I'm just month-to-month at this point. I don't remember signing anything recently.

Agent: Okay, that's good actually. What that means is that you do have the flexibility to look at other providers if you wanted to. But before we go down that road, let me see if I can make a better offer stick here. (typing sounds, pause) You know what, I'm going to add a courtesy credit to your account. I'm going to credit you fifty dollars for the inconvenience of not receiving that notification properly, and I'm going to extend the promotional rate I mentioned—the $99.99 rate—for nine months instead of six. How does that sound?

Customer: Nine months?

Agent: Yes. So you'd be at $99.99 for nine months, and that fifty-dollar credit will be applied to your next bill, so you'd essentially be paying around fifty dollars for that first month.

Customer: (pause) Well, that's... that's actually better. I appreciate that. So after nine months, then what?

Agent: After nine months, you would return to the standard rate of $119.99 per month. But at that point, if you're interested, you can always give us a call and we can look at available promotions again.

Customer: Alright, okay. And the fifty-dollar credit... that goes on my next bill?

Agent: That's correct. You should see that reflected when you receive your next statement. And just to confirm, I'm also putting a note on your account about the promotional end notification, so we can make sure you're better informed next time.

Customer: Yeah, I appreciate that. I really do. I was pretty upset yesterday when I saw the bill, but this helps. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: Of course, James. That's what I'm here for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business. If you have any other questions or issues in the future, don't hesitate to give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
