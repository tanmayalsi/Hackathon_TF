# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm pretty upset about it. My monthly charge went up like thirty dollars, and I wasn't notified about any price increase.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And what's the best name to have on the account?

Customer: It's Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Jennifer, I've got your account pulled up here. I can see your account history. Let me just take a look at your recent billing. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that your previous bill in December was $89.99, and your current bill for January is now $119.99. Is that the increase you're referring to?

Customer: Yes! Exactly. That's... that's almost thirty-five dollars more. I've been a customer for like four years, and I've always paid on time. Why would you just... why would you just raise my rate like that without telling me?

Agent: Yeah, I hear you. Let me see what's going on here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account, and it looks like you were on a promotional rate when you first signed up. That promotion expired at the end of December.

Customer: A promotional rate? I... I don't remember that. I mean, I've had the same bill for years now.

Agent: That's a fair point. So promotional rates typically last for the first year of service, sometimes longer depending on the offer you signed up for. Once that expires, the rate goes to our standard pricing. I'm seeing here that you have our Fiber 500 plan, which—

Customer: (interrupting) Wait, wait. So you're telling me you just let it expire without calling me or sending me a notice about it? Shouldn't you have to tell me that something like this was coming?

Agent: That's actually a really good question. (pause) So, we do send notifications about rate changes. Let me check your account to see... (typing sounds) Were you notified by email?

Customer: I... I don't know. I don't check my email that often, I guess. But still, shouldn't there be something more than that? Like a letter or something?

Agent: You know what, Jennifer, I completely understand where you're coming from. A lot of our customers have expressed similar concerns about promotional rates expiring. Let me see what I can do for you here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so looking at your account history, you've been a great customer. Perfect payment history, never had any service issues. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So what I'd like to do is apply a loyalty credit to your account. I can get you back down to $99.99 per month for the next twelve months. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Really? That... okay, that's better, but it's still more than what I was paying before.

Agent: I understand. The thing is, the promotional rate you were getting at $89.99 was specifically for new customers. But what I'm doing is giving you our loyalty rate, which is $99.99, and that's actually a pretty solid deal. You're saving $20 a month compared to the standard rate of $119.99. Plus, I can throw in a courtesy credit of $35 to cover the difference from your January bill.

Customer: (pause) So you're saying... I'll get $35 credit, and then it'll be $99.99 after that?

Agent: Exactly. The $35 credit will show up on your next bill, which should post within the next couple of days, and then starting in February, your recurring charge will be $99.99 per month for the next year. After that, we can discuss your options again, okay?

Customer: (pause) Okay, um... I guess that works. But I'm not happy about this happening in the first place. Like, I really do think you should notify customers better about these things.

Agent: You know, that's fair feedback, and I really do appreciate you bringing that up. I'm going to make a note on your account about this conversation, and I'd encourage you to reach out to our customer service feedback team as well. Your concerns definitely matter, and they help us improve our processes.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I will. Thank you.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Well, Jennifer, I really appreciate you calling in today, and I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot with that rate increase. You should see that credit on your bill within the next couple of days. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to give us a call back. Is there a preferred number to reach you?

Customer: Um, the number I called from is fine.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, we have that on file. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, Jennifer, and we really do appreciate your business.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: You take care. Bye now.
