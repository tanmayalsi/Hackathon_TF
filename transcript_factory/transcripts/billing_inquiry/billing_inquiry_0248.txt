Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and I noticed my monthly charge went up pretty significantly, and I don't think that's right.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Okay, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Sarah Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. Just one moment while I get everything up here. (pause, typing) Alright, I've got your account open. So you mentioned your charges increased? When did you first notice this?

Customer: I got my bill yesterday, and I opened it this morning. It came in the mail. My bill went from like $79.99 to $109.99. That's a thirty dollar jump! I've been with Frontier for... I don't know, three years now? And I've never seen anything like this without getting some kind of notification or... something.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Sarah. That is a noticeable increase. Let me take a look at what changed on your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your service history here. It looks like on the fifteenth of this month, there was an adjustment made to your plan. Can you tell me—were you contacted about any plan changes?

Customer: No! That's the thing. I didn't authorize any changes. I have the basic fiber package, the one that was supposed to be locked in at that price. I specifically asked about that when I signed up because I didn't want any surprise rate hikes.

Agent: Right, I hear you. (pause) Okay, so looking at your account notes here, it shows that your promotional pricing expired. You had a twelve-month promotional rate at $79.99, and that ended on the fifteenth. So your plan automatically moved to our standard rate, which is $109.99 per month for that same service tier.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. Promotional rate? Nobody told me it was promotional. They told me it was a locked-in rate.

Agent: I understand the confusion. Let me check the notes from when your account was set up. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so unfortunately, I'm not seeing any specific notes about what was promised during the initial signup call, but according to our system, the $79.99 was indeed a twelve-month promotional offer.

Customer: This is ridiculous. I specifically remember asking, and they said it was locked in. I would never have agreed to a promotional rate if I thought my bill was just going to jump thirty dollars after a year.

Agent: I totally understand your frustration, Sarah. And I apologize that this wasn't clearer on your end. You know what, let me see what I can do for you here. (typing sounds) I can see that you've been a really good customer—no late payments, no service issues. How about this: I can extend your promotional pricing for another six months at the $79.99 rate. That would give you some time to reevaluate your plan if you want to, or we can talk about other options.

Customer: (pause) Six months? Why only six months? I mean, I appreciate that, but... I've been paying that price for three years. Why can't it just stay?

Agent: That's fair. Unfortunately, I can only extend promotional pricing for six months at a time based on my authority level. But here's what I can tell you—after that six months ends, you can call back in, and we can look at potentially renewing it again or finding you another offer. We do have new customer incentives that sometimes become available to existing customers if they've been with us for a certain amount of time.

Customer: (sighs) Okay. I guess that's better than nothing. But I want to make sure this is actually going to happen. Can you send me something in writing? Or... can you note my account that we discussed this?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to put a detailed note on your account right now about our conversation. (typing sounds) And yes, I can have a confirmation email sent to you with all the details—the new promotional price, the end date of six months, everything. That way you've got it in writing.

Customer: Okay, that's good. And just to be clear, my bill will go back down to $79.99 on my next billing cycle?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Your next bill should reflect the promotional rate again. It typically takes one to two billing cycles for system updates to fully process, but it should show up on your next statement. And again, you'll get that confirmation email here shortly.

Customer: All right. I appreciate that. Um, one more thing though—if I had called earlier and complained, would you have given me this rate adjustment? Because I feel like I shouldn't have had to call and argue to keep the price I was already paying.

Agent: (pause) That's... that's actually a really good question, Sarah. And honestly, you're right. A lot of times customers don't call, and they just accept the increase. What you should have received was a courtesy notice before your promotional period ended, letting you know that your rate was going to change. I'm sorry that didn't happen in your case.

Customer: Yeah, well... I'm glad I checked my bill then. (pause) Okay, so I'll look for that email?

Agent: Yes, you should receive it within the next few minutes. If you don't see it, just check your spam folder just in case. And again, your bill will go back to $79.99 starting with your next billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thank you for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. I really do apologize again for the confusion on the promotional pricing. We appreciate your loyalty to Frontier, and we hope to have you as a customer for years to come. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
