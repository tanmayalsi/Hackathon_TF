Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I'm calling about my bill. I received it yesterday and I'm pretty upset about it, to be honest.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me just pull that up here... Got it. I see your account for Derek— sorry, what's your name?

Customer: It's Michael. Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I have your account here. So what's the issue you're seeing on your bill?

Customer: Well, my bill jumped up by thirty-five dollars. Last month I was paying $89.99, and this month it's $124.99. I didn't authorize any changes, and nobody told me about a price increase. I've been a customer for like... three years now.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Michael. Let me take a look at what's happening here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account. It looks like your promotional rate expired. You were on a promotional period that was... (typing) ...that was valid through last month. That's now ended, and your rate has gone to the standard pricing.

Customer: Wait, what? I never signed up for a promotional rate. I just had the regular service. Why would there be a promotional rate if I didn't agree to it?

Agent: That's a fair question. When you originally signed up three years ago, the service was set up with an introductory offer. So that was the promotional rate. It was good for twelve months from your installation date, but it looks like... (pause) ...it looks like there may have been an extension on that promotion for an additional period. But that has now concluded.

Customer: Okay, but nobody sent me anything saying it was going to end. I didn't get a letter, I didn't get an email, nothing. And I should've been notified before my bill just jumped up like that.

Agent: You know, that's a really valid point, and I apologize for that. We should have sent you a notice about thirty days before the change took effect. Let me see... (typing sounds) I'm not seeing a record of a notification being sent to your email on file. What email do you have with us?

Customer: It's m-chen at Gmail dot com.

Agent: (typing) Okay, I'm seeing that email address on your account, and I'm showing no outreach notification was sent. That's on us, Michael, and I apologize for that. That's definitely something we should have done.

Customer: So what can we do about this? I mean, I'm not trying to be difficult, but I can't just absorb a thirty-five dollar increase with no warning.

Agent: No, I get it. Let me see what options I have here. (pause) (typing sounds) So here's what I can do for you. I can apply a service credit to your account for the difference this month, so you'd pay the $89.99 instead of the $124.99. That would help offset this month. 

Customer: Okay, but what about going forward? Am I just stuck at this higher price now?

Agent: That's a good question. So our standard fiber package in your area is $124.99 per month for our Gig speed service. However, since we dropped the ball on notification, I may have some flexibility here. Let me check if I can offer you a rate hold for a few months while we get this sorted out. (pause) (typing sounds) (pause) Yes, actually, I can lock you in at $99.99 for the next six months. That's a small increase from your promotional rate, but it gives you some time to decide if you want to keep the service or if you'd like to explore other options.

Customer: So $99.99 for six months, and then what happens after that?

Agent: After six months, it would go to the standard rate of $124.99 unless we work something else out closer to that time. And obviously, we'll make sure you get proper notice before any changes happen again.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I mean, that's better than nothing. But I'm not thrilled about eventually paying $125 a month for internet.

Agent: I hear you. And if you ever want to discuss other packages or promotions we might have available, just give us a call back. We do run different offers throughout the year, and you might qualify for something else. But for right now, this should help bridge the gap, and I'll make sure to put a note on your account that you need to be notified in writing and via email at least 30 days before any future rate changes.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that's fair. So just to confirm—I'm getting a credit for this month's difference, and then starting next month I'm locked in at $99.99 for six months?

Agent: Exactly right. And the credit will show up on your next bill. You should see that within the next billing cycle. I'm applying that right now... (typing sounds) ...and there we go. The credit is processed. You'll see that reflected on your next invoice.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that, Derek. I'm sorry for being a bit short earlier.

Agent: No, not at all, Michael. You had every right to be frustrated. We should have communicated better, so that's on us. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for taking care of that.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thanks for being a Frontier customer, and thanks for calling in. You have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
