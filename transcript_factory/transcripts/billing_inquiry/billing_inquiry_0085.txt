Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, my name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like forty dollars from last month. I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having billing concerns. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here. One moment please.

(pause)

Agent: Okay, I've got your account here. I'm looking at Derek... is this Derek speaking, or...

Customer: No, I'm... my name's Marcus. The account's under my name, Marcus Chen.

Agent: Got it, Marcus. My apologies. Alright, so I can see your account here. Your most recent bill is for $189.99, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Last month it was like $151, maybe $152. Something around there. And I'm looking at this charge here—it says something about an equipment fee that I've never had before. What's that about?

Agent: Let me take a closer look at the itemization. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing... yes, there is an equipment fee that's showing up for the first time this billing cycle. That would be $12.99 for a modem rental fee.

Customer: A modem rental fee? I've never paid that before. I have my own modem. I've been using my own modem since I signed up three years ago.

Agent: Okay, and do you have a Frontier-issued modem as well, or just your own?

Customer: Just my own. I bought it myself from Best Buy when I first got the service. I don't have a Frontier modem.

Agent: (pause) Let me look into this. It's possible that... actually, Marcus, I'm wondering if there was a service change or a plan change that occurred. Did you happen to upgrade your service at any point recently, or did you notice anything different?

Customer: No, nothing. I've just been paying my bill every month like normal. Until now, apparently. So is someone gonna explain why I'm suddenly being charged for equipment I don't even have?

Agent: You're absolutely right to question that. Let me dig a little deeper here. (typing sounds) So I'm also seeing that your internet speed tier increased from 100 megabits to 200 megabits. Do you recall requesting that upgrade?

Customer: What? No. I never asked for that. Why would they upgrade me without asking?

Agent: That's a great question, and I apologize for the confusion. Let me check our notes here. (pause) It looks like there was an automatic plan adjustment made to your account about two weeks ago. I can see a note here, but it's... it's a bit unclear about why it was triggered. It may have been part of a promotion or a system adjustment on our end.

Customer: Okay, well I don't want the upgrade. I was fine with what I had before. Can you just switch me back?

Agent: Absolutely, I can do that for you. That should bring your service back to the 100 megabits, which should also eliminate the modem rental fee since you're not using our equipment. However, I do need to mention that our standard pricing for that tier has increased slightly.

Customer: Great. Of course it has. How much are we talking?

Agent: (pause) So the base rate for the 100-megabit plan is now $129.99, which is an increase of about $8 from what you were paying before. So you'd be looking at roughly $142 with taxes, compared to the previous $151 you mentioned.

Customer: Hmm. So I'd still be paying more than before?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. We did implement a rate increase across the board about three months ago. I understand that's frustrating, though. Let me see if I can help you out here. (typing sounds) I'm actually seeing that we have a promotional rate available for customers in your area. I could put you on our fiber plus plan with 300 megabits at $139.99 for the first six months, then it goes up to $159.99 after that. That would at least get you better speeds at a similar price point for now.

Customer: (hesitating) So for six months it's $139.99, and then it jumps to $159.99?

Agent: That's correct. And that includes no equipment fees because you're using your own modem, which is great.

Customer: But after six months, I'm paying more than I'm paying now anyway.

Agent: You're right, it is higher after the promotional period ends. But you would be getting significantly faster speeds. If you want, I can also look into other options, or we can just revert you back to your original plan at the standard rate.

Customer: (pause) Let me think about this. What I really want is to go back to how it was before. Can you at least credit me for the charges that shouldn't have been there? Like, I got charged for that modem fee and for the speed increase I didn't ask for.

Agent: Absolutely. That's fair. Let me apply a courtesy credit to your account for the equipment rental fee—that's $12.99. And as for the speed upgrade that was automatically applied, let me see what the difference in billing was. (typing sounds) So that was a $10 increase in the monthly rate. I'm going to go ahead and credit you that amount as well for this billing cycle. So you should see $22.99 credited to your next bill.

Customer: Okay, that's... that's good. Thank you. So if I keep things as they were before, what's my bill gonna be?

Agent: Let me calculate that for you. So you'll be back on the 100-megabit plan at $129.99 base rate, plus taxes and fees, which should bring you to approximately $149 to $150, depending on your local taxes. So roughly where you were before, just a hair higher due to that rate increase.

Customer: That's frustrating, but I guess that's just... I don't know. Is there anything you can do about that rate increase?

Agent: I understand your concern. Unfortunately, the rate increase was a system-wide adjustment, so I don't have the ability to adjust that. However, I would encourage you to call us back in a few months if you haven't heard from us. Sometimes we do have promotional offers that roll out, and you might qualify for something.

Customer: Yeah, okay. So you're gonna switch me back to my old plan, and I'm getting the credit for the charges I didn't ask for?

Agent: That's correct. I'm going to process all of that for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I've made the changes. Your service speed is being downgraded back to 100 megabits, the equipment fee is being removed, and I've applied a credit of $22.99 to your account. You should see all of this reflected on your next billing statement.

Customer: Great. When does that take effect?

Agent: The changes take effect immediately, so you should see the speed adjustment right away. The billing changes will appear on your next statement, which should be generated in about... let's see, that would be around the 15th of next month.

Customer: Alright. Well, I appreciate your help, Derek.

Agent: It's actually Derek, but no problem. I'm glad I could help get this sorted out for you, Marcus. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and thanks for calling today. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
