Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and there's a charge on here that wasn't there last month, and honestly, I'm pretty frustrated.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm sorry you're experiencing an issue with your bill. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number for the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me just... okay, I've got you here. I see your account under Robert Martinez. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So you mentioned there's a charge you're concerned about. Can you tell me which charge that is, or do you see something on your most recent bill that looks off?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill was $89.99 every month, right? Like, for the past year. And this month it jumped to $119.99. That's like thirty bucks more. And I... I didn't authorize any upgrades or anything. I just want to know why that happened.

Agent: Okay, I hear you. A thirty-dollar increase is definitely noticeable. Let me look into that for you. (pause) (typing sounds) So I'm seeing here that you are on our Fiber 500 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yes. And that's what I've been paying for. So what's going on?

Agent: Right. Okay, so I see the issue here. It looks like your promotional rate expired. You were on an introductory rate of $89.99 for the first twelve months, and that period ended with your last billing cycle. Your plan has now gone to the standard rate, which is $119.99 per month.

Customer: (sighs) Oh my gosh. So nobody told me about this? I mean, I didn't get any kind of warning or anything. You guys just... bumped up my bill without letting me know?

Agent: I apologize for that, Robert. You should have received a notice about the rate change. Let me check our records here... (typing sounds) I'm not seeing a confirmation that the notice was actually delivered to you, so I understand your frustration. That's not ideal on our part.

Customer: No, it's not. I mean, come on. I've been a customer for over a year. Why would you just surprise me with a thirty-dollar increase?

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I'm sorry about that. What I can do is... let me see what options we have available. (pause) (typing sounds) So, I can look at what current promotions we have. Are you interested in potentially getting a rate reduction, or would you like to explore other plan options that might better fit your budget?

Customer: Well, I mean... I liked my rate, you know? Can't you just keep me on that price? I was happy with it.

Agent: I wish I could lock that in for you, but unfortunately that promotional period has expired across the board. However, I do have some options. We currently have a promotion where new customers can get Fiber 500 for $99.99 for twelve months. Since you've been a loyal customer, I'd like to see if I can apply something similar to your account as a courtesy.

Customer: Okay, so $99.99? That's still more than what I was paying, but... I guess that's better than $119.99.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see if I can get approval on this. One moment, please. (pause) Okay, so I've got the ability to apply a promotional credit that would bring you down to $94.99 per month for the next twelve months. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) So I'd be paying ninety-four ninety-nine instead of ninety-nine ninety-nine?

Agent: Yes, that's right. Ninety-four ninety-nine. It's not quite the original $89.99, but it's closer to where you were, and it gives you another year at that reduced rate before we'd need to revisit the pricing.

Customer: Hmm. Alright, I mean... that's something. Why couldn't the first person just offer me this instead of letting me find out on my own?

Agent: That's a fair question, and I apologize. When that notice wasn't delivered, it left you in the dark, and that's on us. But I'm glad I can help make this right today. I'm going to apply this promotion to your account right now.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Yeah, do that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. And just so you know, this credit will appear on your next billing statement. So your next bill should reflect the $94.99 rate. You'll also receive an updated notice in the mail confirming this promotion and the new rate. That should come within the next five to seven business days.

Customer: Alright. And when does this rate go back up? After twelve months?

Agent: Yes, after twelve months the rate would adjust back to the standard rate, which currently is $119.99, but you'll receive another notification before that happens. And at that time, we can discuss additional options or promotions that might be available to you then as well.

Customer: Okay, that's fair. I appreciate you working with me on this, Derek. I was pretty mad when I called in, so...

Agent: I totally understand, Robert. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... maybe work on getting those notices out to people before their bills jump, you know?

Agent: (chuckles) I hear you. I'll definitely note that feedback. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you, Robert. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
