# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and I was charged almost forty dollars more than usual, and I have no idea why. I've had the same plan for like two years.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing a billing concern. I'd be happy to help you figure this out. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: Sarah Martinez.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. I've got your account here. Let me just take a look at your recent billing history. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing your bill from this month. Can you tell me what you were normally paying before?

Customer: Yeah, it was like $79.99 a month. Every month, consistently. And this month it's showing $119.95. That's... that's almost fifty dollars more. I don't understand what happened.

Agent: Wow, that is quite an increase. Let me see what's going on here. (typing sounds) Sarah, I'm looking at your account and I can see there was a promotional rate that expired on your Frontier Fiber 500 plan. You were receiving a first-year promotional discount of $40 a month, and that ended on the last billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, what? A promotional rate? I was never told about this. Like, nobody told me it was going to expire. I've just been paying the same price this whole time.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me explain what happened. When you signed up two years ago, you were enrolled in a promotional pricing period that was set for twelve months. However, it appears that the promotion may have been extended or there was a lapse before it expired now. That's... that's not ideal communication on our end, and I apologize for that.

Customer: So you're telling me I signed up for a promo that was supposed to last a year, but I've been on it for two years?

Agent: That's correct, and actually, that worked in your favor. You got an extended promotional period. However, now that it has expired, you're seeing the standard rate for that plan, which is $119.95 per month.

Customer: Okay, but that doesn't make sense. Why would I be notified now and not when I signed up? And why didn't I get any kind of warning before this month that my rate was about to go up?

Agent: (pause) Those are really valid questions, Sarah. Honestly, we should have sent you a notification about thirty days before the rate change went into effect. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) 

Customer: I mean, I'm not trying to be difficult, but this is a significant jump. Is there anything we can do about this?

Agent: I totally get it. Let me check what promotional offers are currently available for your account. (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any standard promotional rates available for your current plan right now, but I do have a few options. One option is I could move you to our Fiber 300 plan, which would be $89.99 a month—that's $30 less than where you are now. Would that speed work for you?

Customer: I... I don't know. I stream a lot and I work from home. The 500 speed was important to me when I got it. Do I really need the 500?

Agent: That's a great question. So the 500 plan gives you... well, 500 megabits per second. The 300 plan gives you 300 megabits per second. For streaming and working from home, honestly, 300 is pretty solid. You'd be able to stream 4K video and have video calls without any issues. But if you have multiple devices going at once, the 500 might be better.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. I mean, I'd prefer to keep what I have, but I also can't just absorb a forty-dollar increase. That's ridiculous.

Agent: I hear you. Let me see what else I can do. Let me check with my supervisor really quick—I might be able to apply a one-time retention credit to your account for the rate increase. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, okay. I'll hold.

Agent: (hold music, pause, approximately 30 seconds) Thanks for holding, Sarah. I was able to get approval for a $20 one-time credit that will be applied to your next bill. So instead of paying $119.95 this month, you'll pay $99.95. That brings it down to a more manageable increase of about twenty dollars a month. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) I mean... it's not ideal, but it's better than forty. But can I ask—is there anything else you can do? Like, is this going to keep happening?

Agent: That's a good question. Once the rate change goes into effect, it typically remains at that level unless another promotion becomes available. However, I would strongly recommend that you monitor your account notifications, or I can add a note that you'd like a call or email notification if any further rate changes are coming. Would that help?

Customer: Yes, actually, that would be helpful. Can you definitely do that?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll make that note right now on your account. (typing sounds) And Sarah, I apologize again that we didn't get you that advance notification. That's on us.

Customer: Okay. Well, thank you for at least getting me the credit. I appreciate that.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... if my rate goes up again, I'd like to know ahead of time, you know?

Agent: Absolutely. That note is on your account now, and we will make sure you're contacted before any changes happen. Thanks so much for calling Frontier, Sarah. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
