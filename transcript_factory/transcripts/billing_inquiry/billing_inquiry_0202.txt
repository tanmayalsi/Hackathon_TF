Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like thirty bucks from last month. I need to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm really sorry you're experiencing that. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... and I've got you, thank you. I'm seeing an account for Michael Torres at... is that 432 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So let me take a look at what we've got here. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your current bill is $127.99. Is that the amount you're concerned about?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Last month I paid like $97, maybe $98. And I never agreed to any price increase. I've been a customer for... I don't know, like four years? And my rate's been the same the whole time.

Agent: I understand that's frustrating, Michael. Let me see what changed. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your service history here. You're on our Frontier Fiber 500 plan, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: So I'm seeing that your plan was previously $89.99 a month, and as of your last billing cycle, it adjusted to $109.99. That would account for... let me see... that's about a $20 increase there. And then I'm also seeing a charge here for $18.00 labeled as "Equipment Upgrade Fee." Is that something you authorized?

Customer: No! I didn't authorize anything. I didn't upgrade anything. My equipment's been working fine. What is that charge?

Agent: (pause) Let me look into that for you. This sometimes happens when we... (typing sounds) ...okay, so according to our system, there was a modem upgrade that was processed on your account on the 15th of last month. Do you remember anyone from Frontier contacting you about that?

Customer: No, nobody called me. I mean, I might've gotten an email or something, but I definitely didn't agree to pay eighteen bucks for a modem I didn't ask for.

Agent: Yeah, that's... I apologize for that. That shouldn't have been applied without your explicit consent. Let me address both of these issues. First, regarding the price increase—we did implement a rate adjustment for fiber customers in your area effective last month. It was a service enhancement to support network improvements and infrastructure upgrades in your region.

Customer: Okay, but did I get notified about that? Because I didn't see anything.

Agent: That's a really good question. We typically send out notifications about rate changes about thirty days in advance, either by mail or email. Do you have an email on file with us?

Customer: Yeah, I think so. It's michaelt1987@... actually, can you just check what you have?

Agent: (typing sounds) I'm showing michaelt1987@mailbox.com. Does that sound right?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Okay, so we should have sent you a notification to that address. It's possible it went to your spam folder, or... (pause) ...but that's not really an excuse on our end. I apologize for that. Now, as for the equipment fee—I'm going to remove that $18.00 charge from your account right now.

Customer: Okay, good. What about the rate increase though? Can you do anything about that?

Agent: (pause) That's... so the rate increase is a little different situation. That's a service-wide adjustment, so I'm not able to waive that entirely. However, what I can do is this—I can apply a one-time account credit of $25 to your account as a courtesy for the inconvenience and for the unauthorized equipment charge. That would bring your next bill down significantly.

Customer: A one-time credit? So next month I'm still paying the higher rate?

Agent: Well, yes. The new rate of $109.99 is the current rate for the Frontier Fiber 500 plan in your area. But I want to be transparent with you—if you're interested, I do have some alternative options we could explore.

Customer: Like what?

Agent: Well, we have our Frontier Fiber 300 plan, which is $79.99 a month. You'd get 300 megabits per second instead of 500, but for most households, that's still more than enough for streaming, gaming, video conferencing...

Customer: No, I... I use the 500 plan. I stream a lot, and I've got multiple people in my house doing different things. I need that speed. I'm just frustrated because I feel like I'm being nickel-and-dimed here, you know?

Agent: I completely understand, and I genuinely apologize that you're feeling that way. You've been a loyal customer for four years, and you should feel valued. (pause) Let me see what else I can do here. Give me just one second...

Customer: (background) Okay, sure.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, Michael, here's what I'm authorized to do. I'm going to remove the $18 equipment fee—that's already done. I'm going to apply a $25 service credit to your account. And I'm going to apply an additional $15 account credit for the rate increase, which will bring your next bill to around $97.99 instead of the full $127.99. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Really? You can do that?

Agent: Yes, I can. The second credit is a one-time courtesy adjustment for a valued long-term customer, but I can apply it. And I want to make sure you receive proper notification of any future changes to your account. Would you prefer email, mail, or would you like me to add a note to your account to have someone call you?

Customer: Email is fine, I guess. But maybe you could make a note anyway, just so I know what's going on?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm making that note right now. (typing sounds) And I'm also submitting a request to have you added to our VIP customer notification list, so you'll get extra advance notice on any service changes or billing adjustments.

Customer: Okay, that's good. Thank you. So just to confirm, my next bill will be lower?

Agent: Your next bill will be approximately $97.99, yes. That includes the removal of the equipment charge and both of the credits I've applied. After that billing cycle, your regular rate will be $109.99 for the Fiber 500 plan, unless there are any other changes, and you'll get proper notification about those.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. Is there anything else I need to know?

Agent: I don't think so. Just to recap what we've done today—I've removed the $18 equipment upgrade fee, applied a $25 service credit, and an additional $15 account credit. I've also made a note on your account about proper notifications going forward. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thank you for taking care of that.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael. I really do appreciate your patience, and I'm sorry again for the frustration. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you, and goodbye.
