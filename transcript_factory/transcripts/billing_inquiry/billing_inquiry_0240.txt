# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize. It's like... it went up by thirty dollars and nobody told me about it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And what name is the account under?

Customer: Patricia Mendez. M-E-N-D-E-Z.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it, Patricia. Just give me one second here... Alright, I'm pulling up your account now. Can you tell me a little bit more about the charge you're seeing? Like, what line item are you concerned about?

Customer: Well, my bill was usually like ninety-nine dollars a month, right? And this month it came through at a hundred and twenty-nine. That's... that's a thirty-dollar jump. And I didn't authorize any upgrade or anything like that.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me take a look at what changed on the account. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that on the 15th of last month, there was a service modification. It looks like your internet speed was upgraded from our 500 Mbps fiber package to our Gig speed package.

Customer: What? I didn't ask for that! I don't want the Gig speed. I was perfectly happy with what I had.

Agent: I hear you. That's frustrating. Let me check the notes here to see if there's any documentation on why that change was made. (pause) (typing sounds) It looks like you may have received a promotional offer, and it appears it was accepted...

Customer: [inaudible] promotional offer? I didn't accept anything. I would've remembered that. I don't even remember getting anything about a gig upgrade.

Agent: I understand. You know, sometimes these can be applied through our website or over the phone if someone called in, or occasionally they can be sent via mail. Do you remember receiving anything in the mail recently about upgrading your service?

Customer: Well, yeah, actually, I did get something. I got like a postcard or something saying I qualified for a special offer. But I threw it away! I didn't call anyone. I definitely didn't agree to it.

Agent: Okay, so it sounds like it may have been activated without a clear confirmation from you. That's something we take seriously. Let me see what options I have here. (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, so I can definitely help you with this. We can downgrade you back to your previous 500 Mbps plan, which would bring your bill back down to ninety-nine dollars.

Customer: Okay, yes, I want to do that. But what about this month's bill? I already got charged the extra thirty dollars.

Agent: That's a fair question. Let me look into that for you. So here's what I can do—I can credit back the difference for this billing cycle since you didn't actually authorize the upgrade. That would be a thirty-dollar credit that should show up on your next bill or potentially as a refund depending on your payment method. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Okay, that sounds fair, I guess. But... I mean, how did this even happen? I don't want this to happen again.

Agent: That's a really good question, and I appreciate you asking. So typically, when we send out promotional offers like that, they're designed to be activated only when a customer calls in or confirms online. But I'm going to make a note on your account right now. I'm also going to flag this so that our billing department is aware of the situation. And I'm going to go ahead and remove you from our promotional contact list if you'd like, so you don't receive these kinds of offers in the future.

Customer: Yeah, please do that. That would be great.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I've made that note. So just to recap what we're doing here: I'm downgrading your internet service back to the 500 Mbps fiber package, which will bring your bill back to ninety-nine dollars starting next month. And I'm applying a thirty-dollar credit to this month's overcharge.

Customer: Okay, good. How long does the credit take to show up?

Agent: The credit should appear on your next bill, which would be generated around the same time next month. If you'd prefer, I can have it processed as a refund instead, but that typically takes five to seven business days to show up in your account.

Customer: No, it's fine. I'll just apply it to next month's bill. That works.

Agent: Perfect. And is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course. Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, Patricia, and again, I apologize for the confusion with the upgrade. If you have any issues or questions going forward, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Thank you. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Take care!
