Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my monthly rate went up. I've been a customer for like... three years now, and I don't think I should be paying more for the same service.

Agent: I understand your frustration. I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account real quick so I can take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment... (pause) Alright, I've got your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. Can you tell me which charge seems unfamiliar to you? Is there a specific line item that's catching your eye?

Customer: Yeah, there's a $49.99 charge that says "Equipment Fee - Installation." I didn't have any installation work done this month. Like, I've had my equipment for years. Why am I all of a sudden being charged for installation?

Agent: That's a good question. Let me look into that. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that... oh, I think I see what happened. It looks like you had a modem replacement sent out to you about two weeks ago. Did you receive a new modem?

Customer: Well, yeah, actually I did. But I didn't ask for it. You guys just sent it to me. I thought it was just a free upgrade or something.

Agent: I apologize for the confusion there. So looking at your notes, it does appear that the modem was sent as a replacement at no charge—that part should have been free. However, it seems like someone in our system may have accidentally coded a one-time installation fee. That's on us, and I can definitely remove that charge for you.

Customer: Okay, well... that's good. But what about my regular monthly bill? It's gone up by like fifteen bucks. It was $89.99 before and now it's $104.99. I didn't sign up for any upgrades or anything. What's that about?

Agent: (pause) Let me take a look at that for you. (typing sounds) Hmm, okay so I'm looking at your rate history here. It does show that your promotional rate expired. You had a three-year promotional pricing that was set to expire this month, and your rate has adjusted to our standard Fiber 500 pricing.

Customer: Wait, nobody told me about that. I mean... (trailing off) ...I feel like I should have gotten a notification or something. That's a big increase.

Agent: You know what, I completely understand why you'd be upset about that. Typically we do send a notice about rate adjustments, but I can see how something like that might get missed or end up in spam. Let me see what I can do for you here. (typing sounds) (pause) What I can offer you is... I can apply a promotional rate for the next twelve months that would bring you down to $94.99 per month. That's not quite the original rate, but it's a significant savings compared to the current standard pricing.

Customer: So that's like a $10 difference from what I'm about to pay?

Agent: Yes, exactly. So instead of $104.99, you'd be paying $94.99 for the next year on your Fiber 500 plan. After that year, the rate would go back to standard pricing unless we have another promotion available, but I'd definitely recommend reaching out to us before it expires so we can discuss options.

Customer: (pause) I mean, that's better, but it's still more than what I was paying before. Is there anything else you can do?

Agent: That's really the best option I have available right now with your current service level. However, if you're looking to reduce your bill further, we do have our Fiber 300 plan which would be $69.99 per month. It's obviously a slower speed, but a lot of customers find it works fine for their needs. Would that be something you'd be interested in exploring?

Customer: I mean... no, not really. I use my internet for working from home and video conferencing. I need the speed. So, I'll just take that $94.99 rate then.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to go ahead and apply that for you. And I'm also removing that $49.99 equipment fee. So your next bill should reflect both of those changes. You should see the adjustment by your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay. And just to confirm—that rate is locked in for twelve months?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. For the next twelve months you'll be at $94.99. We'll send you a courtesy notice before it expires so you have time to contact us if you want to discuss other options.

Customer: Alright, thank you. I appreciate you taking care of that.

Agent: You're welcome! I really do apologize again for the confusion with the rate change notification. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Great. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
