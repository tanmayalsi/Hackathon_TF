# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually, I do recognize it, but it shouldn't be there.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. Can I also get a name on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's under James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Alright, James, I'm seeing your account here. What charge are you concerned about?

Customer: So, um... my bill jumped up this month. It went from like $79.99 to $94.99. That's a fifteen dollar increase out of nowhere. I haven't added any services or anything like that.

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. Let me take a look at what's on your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that you're on our Gig Speed plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, the gigabit fiber plan. I signed up for that like eight months ago.

Agent: Right. So what I'm seeing is that you had a promotional rate that was set to expire. That twelve-month promotional period ended on the first of this month, so your rate has adjusted to our standard pricing for that service tier.

Customer: Wait, wait. Nobody told me about that. I didn't agree to any of this. When I signed up, they said the price was $79.99.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Let me check the notes here on your account. (pause) It looks like the promotional rate was mentioned at the time of signup. Typically, those are, um, they're good for the first twelve months, and then after that period, the rate goes to the regular pricing.

Customer: That's... that's really not okay. I mean, I didn't read some fine print about it changing. The guy who sold me on this said I'd have a great price. He didn't say it was temporary.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I hear you. And I apologize that that wasn't made more clear at the time. Um, so the increase you're seeing—that $15 difference—that is the difference between the promotional rate and our standard Gig Speed rate, which is currently $94.99 a month.

Customer: Can I just go back to my old plan? What was I paying before? Like, $65 or something?

Agent: Let me look at your account history here. (typing sounds) So before you upgraded to the Gig Speed plan, you were on our standard Fiber 500 plan at $64.99 per month.

Customer: Okay, so I want to downgrade back to that.

Agent: I can definitely help you with that. Before we do, I do want to mention that with the Fiber 500 plan, you'd be getting speeds of up to 500 megabits per second, whereas the Gig plan is up to one gigabit, so that's about twice the speed. Are you sure you want to downgrade?

Customer: (pause) Well... I mean, the faster speed is nice, but I'm not using it, you know? I'm just streaming Netflix and checking email. I don't need a gigabit.

Agent: That's fair. Um, actually, let me see if I can offer you something else. One second. (pause) So I'm looking at our current promotions, and I can offer you a rate adjustment on the Gig Speed plan. I could bring that down to $84.99 for the next six months. That would be a promotional rate, and it would expire after that period.

Customer: So it's just going to jump back up again in six months?

Agent: (pause) Yes, after the six-month promotional period, it would go back to the standard rate of $94.99. But at least that gives you some time at a reduced rate.

Customer: Hmm. Or I could just go back to the 500 plan and pay $64.99?

Agent: Yes, that's also an option. You'd have the slower speeds, but the pricing would be locked in at that rate.

Customer: (pause) You know what, can I think about it? I don't want to make a decision right now.

Agent: Of course, that's totally fine. But I do want to see if I can help you today. Um, actually, let me check something else. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm also seeing that you've been a customer with us for almost a year without any service issues, and you're in good standing. Because of that, I might be able to offer you the Gig plan at $84.99, but I can extend that promotional rate for nine months instead of six. How does that sound?

Customer: Really? Nine months?

Agent: Yes, I can do that for you. That would bring your bill down to $84.99 starting with your next billing cycle, and that rate would be locked in through... (typing sounds) ...through mid-July. After that, it would adjust to the standard rate unless there are other promotions available at that time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I mean... that's better. That's only $5 more than what I was paying before.

Agent: Right, and you still get the faster gigabit speeds.

Customer: Alright, yeah, let's do that. Let's do the nine-month promotion.

Agent: Perfect. I'll go ahead and apply that to your account right now. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, all set. The rate change will take effect on your next billing cycle, which should be on the 15th of next month. You should see the $84.99 charge reflected on that bill.

Customer: Great. And I'll get some kind of confirmation or something?

Agent: You'll see it reflected on your bill, and I can also send you an email confirmation of the rate change and the terms. Is the email on file still good?

Customer: Um, it should be james.mitchell@email.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'll send that right over to you.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course, James. That's what I'm here for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm good.

Agent: Alright. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
