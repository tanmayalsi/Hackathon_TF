Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I noticed my monthly charge went up. Like, significantly. I've been a customer for three years and I want to know why I'm suddenly being charged more.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about a billing change. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number too.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. Let me pull that up here... Alright, I've got your account. I can see you're on our Fiber 200 plan. Can you tell me what you're seeing as the increase?

Customer: Yeah, so last month I paid $79.99, and this month the bill is showing $99.99. That's a twenty dollar jump. I didn't authorize any service changes or anything, so I'm really confused.

Agent: I understand. That would definitely be frustrating. Let me take a look at what might have happened here... (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate expired. You've been on an introductory pricing for the first 24 months of service, and that period has ended.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about this. I mean, I didn't see anything in the mail about it, and... I check my emails too. This is the first I'm hearing about it.

Agent: (pause) I can absolutely understand your frustration. Let me check the account notes here to see if there's any documentation of notification attempts... (typing sounds) I'm seeing that a notice was sent out about 60 days ago to the address on file, which I have as 4521 Maple Drive, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's my address, but I'm telling you I never got anything. We get a lot of mail, but I would've noticed something like that. That's not okay.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, there can sometimes be delays with postal mail, but I completely understand your concern. The good news is that I can certainly help you out here. What I can do is apply a courtesy credit to your account for the difference. Let me see what options I have available... (typing sounds)

Customer: Okay, that would be helpful. How much of a credit are we talking?

Agent: So I'm going to apply a $20 credit to your next billing cycle to make up for this month's increase. However, I do want to let you know that going forward, the new rate of $99.99 per month would be your standard rate unless you'd like to discuss other options.

Customer: So you're just... giving me a credit for one month? That doesn't really solve the problem though. I mean, I liked the rate I had before. Can't you just keep it at the old price?

Agent: I completely understand why you'd want to keep that rate. Unfortunately, the promotional pricing period has ended, so we're not able to extend that further. However, what I can do is look at our current promotions to see if there's anything that might work for you... (pause, typing sounds) 

Customer: Like what? I just want to not pay more than what I was paying. I have other options in my area, you know.

Agent: I appreciate you mentioning that, and I definitely want to keep your business with us. Let me see what we can work out. Are you currently using just the internet service, or do you have any other services?

Customer: Just internet. I don't need TV or phone service.

Agent: Okay, so for internet-only customers, I'm actually seeing that we have a special offer right now for existing customers. I can move you to our Fiber 300 plan—that's actually a faster speed—and keep you at $79.99 for 12 months. After that, it would go to the regular price, but that would give you some time and a better service level.

Customer: (pause) Really? You can do that?

Agent: Yes, I can absolutely do that. It's within my ability to help retain a valued customer like yourself. This would give you double the speed you have now, and you'd maintain your current price point for the next year. After that 12-month period, we'd go from there.

Customer: Okay... yeah, that actually sounds pretty good. So I'd get the faster speed and the same price I'm paying now?

Agent: That's exactly right. So to summarize, I'm going to apply that $20 credit to your current bill, and I'm going to add you to our Fiber 300 plan at $79.99 per month for the next 12 months. You should see that reflected in your next bill, and the speed upgrade should be active within the next 24 hours.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. Um, and just to be clear, after the 12 months is up, what happens then?

Agent: After the 12 months, the standard rate for that plan would apply, but you'd be able to call us back and we could look at what promotions are available at that time. We can definitely revisit it when it gets closer.

Customer: Fair enough. Alright, thank you for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
