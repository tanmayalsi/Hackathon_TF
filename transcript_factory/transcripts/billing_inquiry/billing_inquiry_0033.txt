# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge I don't understand. My internet bill went up like thirty dollars and nobody told me about it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And what name is the account under?

Customer: Lisa Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Lisa. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Okay, I've got you here. I can see your account and your recent billing. Can you tell me which bill we're talking about? Is this your most recent one?

Customer: Yes, the one I just got. It came yesterday. My bill was usually around seventy-five dollars and now it's jumping to like, a hundred and five. That's almost a thirty-dollar increase and I have no idea why.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Lisa. Let me take a look at what's on this bill for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your current plan here. You're on our Fiber Gig package, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's what I have. But I've had that for like two years. Why would it suddenly cost more?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me see what I can find here. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate has expired. You had an introductory rate of $79.99 for the first 24 months, and that period has ended. So now you're moving to the standard rate, which is $109.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't agree to any introductory rate. I don't remember signing up for something temporary.

Agent: I understand. A lot of customers aren't aware of promotional periods. Let me pull up the details of when your account was set up. (typing sounds) (pause) So it looks like your service was activated on February 15th, 2022, and the promotion was set for 24 months. That would have ended around mid-February of this year.

Customer: Okay, well, no one told me that was coming. I mean, I got service from you guys for two years at one price and now it's just jumping up? That doesn't seem right.

Agent: I hear you, Lisa. You know, this is actually pretty standard practice in the industry—most promotional rates are temporary to help customers try out the service. Typically, we do send notifications, but I can see how that might have been missed. (pause) But the good news is, I may be able to help you here.

Customer: Okay, what do you mean?

Agent: Well, because you've been such a loyal customer for two years with us, I'd like to see what options we have available. Let me check what promotions I can apply to your account. (typing sounds) (longer pause) Okay, so what I can do is offer you an extended promotional rate. I can lock you in at $89.99 per month for another 12 months. That's a significant savings compared to the standard rate.

Customer: That's better than what I'm being charged now, but it's still more than what I was paying. Can't you just keep me at the original price?

Agent: Unfortunately, I'm not able to keep you at the introductory rate since that was specifically a two-year promotion. However, the $89.99 rate is something we offer to valued long-term customers, and it's one of the better rates I have available right now. After the 12 months are up, your rate would adjust again, but we could look at options at that time as well.

Customer: (sighs) So basically you're saying the price goes up no matter what, I just get a delay on it?

Agent: I understand how it feels that way, Lisa. What I would say is, we do regularly review our network investments and service improvements, and those do factor into pricing. But I do want to make sure you feel like you're getting good value. The $89.99 for the next year is about a 13% increase from what you were paying, but it keeps you at a competitive rate, especially for the speed and reliability you're getting.

Customer: (pause) Well... I mean, I like the service. The internet's been really fast and reliable, so I guess... can you guarantee that rate for the full 12 months?

Agent: Absolutely. I can apply that right now, and you'll see it take effect on your next billing cycle, which should be on the 15th of next month. You'll get a confirmation via email as well with the new rate. And Lisa, I'm also going to add a $20 credit to your account this month as a thank you for your loyalty.

Customer: Really? Okay, that's... that's actually really helpful. Thank you.

Agent: Of course. Let me just confirm all of this for you. I'm going to add the 12-month promotional rate of $89.99 per month, and I'm adding that $20 account credit for this billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I think that's good. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: My pleasure, Lisa. And just so you have it, if you have any issues down the road or if you want to reach out before your promotion is ending next year, you can always give us a call back. We're here to help.

Customer: Okay, sounds good. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer, Lisa. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
