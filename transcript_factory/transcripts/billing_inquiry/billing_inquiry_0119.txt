Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. My internet bill just went up like forty bucks, and I need to know why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your bill. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. And honestly, I've been a customer for like five years now, so this is frustrating.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up right now. I appreciate your loyalty, and I understand your frustration. Let me see what we have here. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account. Your service address is on Maple Street in Portland, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So I can see that your bill this month is $89.99. Is that the amount you're seeing?

Customer: No, no. Last month it was $49.99, and now it's showing $89.99. That's a forty dollar increase! I didn't authorize any changes, and nobody called me about this.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me take a closer look at what happened here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that on the 15th of last month, your promotional rate expired. You were on our introductory pricing for twelve months, and that period came to an end.

Customer: A promotional rate? I was never told about this. I mean, I knew I had a good deal, but I wasn't expecting this kind of jump. That's... that's more than double.

Agent: I hear you, and I apologize that we didn't do a better job reaching out before this happened. (pause) So looking at your account notes here, it looks like you were on our 500 Mbps fiber plan at $49.99 per month for the first year. Now that the promo has ended, you've been moved to the standard rate of $89.99.

Customer: Okay, so what are my options here? Can I get back on a promotional rate, or is there anything you can do? Because I'm not paying ninety dollars a month for internet.

Agent: That's a fair question. Let me see what I can do for you. (pause) Alright, so I do have a few options. First, I can offer you a loyalty discount. Since you've been with us for five years, I can adjust your rate down to $69.99 per month for the next twelve months.

Customer: So that's still a twenty dollar increase from what I was paying.

Agent: I understand it's not ideal, but the introductory pricing we offered is really designed as a limited-time offer to get new customers started. However, let me see if there's anything else I can do. (typing sounds) One option would be to move you to our 300 Mbps plan, which would be $59.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, would I lose speed? I mean, I use my internet for streaming, video calls for work... would 300 be enough?

Agent: That's a great question. Most customers find 300 Mbps more than sufficient for streaming and video calls, even with multiple people using the connection. The main difference you'd notice would really be in download times for very large files. Do you do a lot of large file transfers?

Customer: (pause) Not really, I guess. Mostly just streaming and Zoom meetings. But I also don't want to feel like I'm downgrading, you know?

Agent: I completely get that. Tell you what—I can also waive your modem rental fee for the next six months. That's an extra ten dollars a month savings. So if you stay on the 500 Mbps plan with the loyalty discount I mentioned, you'd be at $69.99, but we'd knock off the modem fee, so you're really at $59.99 a month for the next six months. After that, the modem fee would come back unless something changes.

Customer: (pause) So for the next six months, I'd be at $59.99?

Agent: That's correct. And then after six months, it would go to $69.99 with the ten-dollar modem fee returning. I know that's still higher than your promotional rate, but it's the best I can offer you at this moment given your loyalty to us.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Okay, can I ask... is this written in stone, or do I have any flexibility if I want to renegotiate later?

Agent: That's a really smart question. So the loyalty rate of $69.99 is locked in for twelve months from today, and the modem fee waiver is for six months. If you want to reach out and discuss your options again after that time period, you certainly can. We always look at what promotions might be available. But I do want to set expectations—I can't guarantee we'll have something better available at that time.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that honesty. You know, I'm still not thrilled about this, but at least you explained it and you're meeting me somewhat in the middle. Can you email me something showing these charges and the breakdown of the adjustments?

Agent: Absolutely. I can definitely send that to you. Let me just make sure I have your email on file. (typing sounds) Is it [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: No, it's actually m-a-r-t-i-n-s-a-5-2-6 at Gmail. One word.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. So I'm applying the loyalty discount and the modem fee waiver right now. You should see those reflected on your next bill. And I'm going to send you an email confirmation within the next few minutes that shows the promotional period that expired, your new rates, and all the adjustments we discussed today.

Customer: Good. Thank you. I do appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I still wish I'd gotten a heads up, but at least this is manageable.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm genuinely sorry we didn't communicate that better. We'll make a note on your account, and if you have any other issues, please don't hesitate to reach out. You have a great day, and thanks again for being a loyal Frontier customer.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
