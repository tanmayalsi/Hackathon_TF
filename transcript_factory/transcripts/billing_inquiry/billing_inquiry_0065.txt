Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm really confused about a charge. I've been with you guys for like three years now, and my bill just jumped up almost thirty dollars. Can you explain that to me?

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your bill. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under Michael Torres.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. Thank you. Let me pull up your account here... (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your account now. I can see you do have a recent charge increase. Can you tell me what your bill was before, and what it is now?

Customer: Well, it was like $79.99 a month, and now it's $109.50. That's... that's almost a forty percent increase, man. I mean, I didn't authorize any upgrades or anything. I'm still using the same Gig fiber plan I've always had.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Michael. Let me break down what I'm seeing here. (typing sounds) So I'm looking at your billing history, and it appears that your promotional rate expired. You've been on a promotional pricing for the first 24 months of your service, which was $79.99 a month. That promotion ended last month, and you've now moved to our standard rate for the Gig fiber plan, which is $109.50.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. Promotional rate? I was never told about any... any expiration date on that price. When I signed up, they said this was my price. Nobody said anything about it going up after two years.

Agent: I understand. Let me check the notes here on your account... (pause) It looks like the promotional terms would have been included in your service agreement when you signed up, but I can absolutely understand how that might have been overlooked or not clearly explained. That's frustrating.

Customer: Yeah, it is. So what can we do about this? Can you like... can you put me back on that rate, or give me some kind of discount?

Agent: (pause) Well, that's a great question. The promotional rate was specifically for the first 24 months as a new customer offer, so unfortunately I can't reinstate that exact rate. However, what I can do is look into some other options for you. Let me check what loyalty offers I have available... (typing sounds) 

Customer: Okay, because honestly, if I can't get this resolved, I might just switch to Comcast. I saw they're offering some deal in my area.

Agent: I totally get it, Michael. Internet services are competitive, and I want to make sure we keep your business. (pause) Alright, so I'm seeing that I do have the ability to offer you a loyalty discount. I can get you $20 off your monthly bill for the next 12 months. That would bring your rate down to $89.50 a month instead of $109.50.

Customer: (pause) So I'd still be paying ten dollars more than what I was paying before?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. The standard rate for that plan is $109.50, so the $20 discount would be bringing it down from that. I know it's still an increase from your promotional rate, but it does help bridge that gap.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Can you do better than that? Like, what if I sign a contract or something? Or bundle with other services?

Agent: That's a really good question. Let me see what other options might be available... (typing sounds) Are you currently getting phone or TV services through us, or is it just the internet?

Customer: No, just the internet. I use streaming services for TV, and I have my cell phone through another company.

Agent: Okay, understood. (pause) So the bundling option wouldn't apply here then. As far as a contract goes... we actually don't have traditional contracts anymore, but I could potentially increase the loyalty discount if you agree to stay with us for another 24 months. Let me check what I can authorize... (typing sounds) I might be able to offer you $25 off per month for 24 months instead of 12. That would put you at $84.50 a month.

Customer: For how long though? Like, what happens after 24 months?

Agent: After 24 months, you would go back to the standard rate of $109.50 unless we have another promotion available at that time. But that does give you over two years at that locked-in rate.

Customer: (pause) Well, that's better, but... I mean, I'm still not thrilled about this. It feels like you're punishing loyal customers by raising their rates. I've been paying on time for three years, never missed a payment, and now suddenly I'm paying more?

Agent: Michael, I really do hear your frustration, and you're right. Loyalty should count for something. (pause) Let me be honest with you—the reason the rate increases after the promotional period is because we need to stay competitive during the initial sign-up phase, but we also have to account for ongoing network maintenance and infrastructure costs. It's not an ideal situation, I know.

Customer: Yeah, well... (pause) I guess $84.50 is something. Will I need to sign anything for that?

Agent: I can email you a digital agreement that outlines the terms—the $25 loyalty discount for 24 months and the rate of $84.50 per month. You can review it, and if you're comfortable with it, just reply to confirm. It's pretty straightforward, and it'll take effect on your next billing cycle.

Customer: And this is locked in? Like, it won't change?

Agent: That's correct. For the next 24 months, your rate will be $84.50 per month with the $25 discount applied. After that 24-month period, the terms would be subject to review, but you'd have time to reach out to us before anything changes.

Customer: (pause) Okay, alright. I'll take it. But I want to be clear—I'm not happy about how this was handled. I think you should do a better job communicating this stuff to customers upfront.

Agent: I really appreciate that feedback, Michael, and I'm going to make a note on your account about this conversation. Your point is completely valid, and feedback like yours helps us improve. We'll get that email out to you shortly with the agreement.

Customer: Alright. When will that be?

Agent: It should arrive within the next 15 minutes to the email address on your account. Is that still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And Michael, just to confirm everything—we've added a $25 monthly loyalty discount for 24 months, bringing your rate to $84.50. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that's it. I mean, I'm still frustrated, but... I guess this works for now.

Agent: I understand, and I really do appreciate your patience. Thank you for being a Frontier customer for the past three years. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you, Michael. Have a great day, and we'll be in touch with that agreement shortly.

Customer: Okay, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
