Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was charged for something I shouldn't have been, and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Sarah Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. I've got your account here. So you're saying there's a charge on your bill that shouldn't be there?

Customer: Yes. So I've been with Frontier for... I don't know, three years? And my bill was always $79.99 a month for the Fiber 300 plan. But this month, this bill that just came in, it's $94.99. That's like fifteen dollars more, and nobody told me about a price increase.

Agent: (pause) I understand that's frustrating. Let me just pull up your billing history here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account, and I do see that your rate did increase on your last billing cycle, which would have been... looks like October 15th. So the new rate of $94.99 took effect then.

Customer: But why? I never agreed to a price increase. I didn't get any notification about this. This is ridiculous.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Let me explain what happened. So, um, you've been on a promotional rate for the past three years. That promotional period expired, so your rate went back to our standard pricing for the Fiber 300 plan in your area, which is $94.99 a month.

Customer: Wait, so nobody informed me about this? I should have gotten a letter or something, right? An email?

Agent: That's a really good question. Let me check your account notes to see if we sent out any... (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like a notice was mailed to the address we have on file about thirty days prior to the rate change. That would have been mid-September.

Customer: I mean, I don't remember getting anything, but okay, fine. So what are my options here? Can I go back to the promotional rate, or...?

Agent: Unfortunately, the promotional rate expired, so I can't reinstate that specific promotion. However, I do have some options for you. We currently have a promotion running where new and existing customers can lock in a rate of $84.99 a month for the Fiber 300 plan for twelve months if you commit to a one-year contract.

Customer: (pause) So you're telling me I'd have to sign a contract? I don't really want to do that.

Agent: I understand. Well, without a contract, you'd be on our standard month-to-month pricing. But let me just... do you have a moment? I want to see if there are any other options I can explore for you.

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm pulling up some alternative promotions. Uh, hold on one second. (pause) So actually, I do see that we have a loyalty promotion available for existing customers. Since you've been with us for three years without any service interruptions, I can offer you $89.99 a month for the Fiber 300 plan. That's a reduction from the standard $94.99, and it would be good for the next... twelve months.

Customer: Okay, so that's five dollars less than what I'm paying now?

Agent: (pause) Right, so your current rate is $94.99, so this would be five dollars less, bringing you to $89.99 a month.

Customer: And that's for how long?

Agent: That would be for the next twelve months, and then after that, your rate would... well, it would be subject to our standard pricing unless another promotion comes up.

Customer: (sighs) Okay. I mean, I guess that's better than nothing, but I'm not thrilled about any of this. I wish I'd been more aware of the promotion ending.

Agent: I totally understand, and I'm sorry you didn't catch the notice. These things happen, and honestly, a lot of our customers don't see those letters. But I'm glad I can get you this loyalty rate locked in. It'll help offset that increase.

Customer: Okay, fine. Let's do it. Can you apply that now?

Agent: Absolutely. So what I'm going to do is apply this promotion to your account. (typing sounds) I'm just entering it in the system here. This should take just a moment...

(pause)

Agent: Perfect. All set. So your new rate of $89.99 will be effective on your next billing cycle, which should be November 15th. You'll see that reflected on that bill.

Customer: Okay. And just to confirm, that's locked in for twelve months?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Twelve months from today. After that, if you don't hear from us about a new promotion, you'd go back to standard pricing at that time.

Customer: Got it. Well, I appreciate you finding that option, Derek. I'm still a little annoyed about the whole situation, but this helps.

Agent: I really appreciate your patience, Sarah, and I'm sorry again about the confusion with the rate change. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Great. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and thanks for calling in today. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
