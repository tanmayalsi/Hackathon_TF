Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I just got my statement for this month and there's a charge on here that shouldn't be there.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Alright, I've got your account. The name on the account is David Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned there's a charge you're disputing. Can you tell me a little more about what you're seeing?

Customer: Well, my bill went up. Like, significantly. Last month I was paying $79.99, and this month it's $129.99. That's fifty dollars more! I haven't added any services or anything. I want to know why it jumped like that.

Agent: (pause) I understand that's frustrating, Mr. Chen. Let me take a look at your account history here... (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you were enrolled in a promotional rate of $79.99 for the first twelve months of your service. And according to the information I have, that promotion ended this month, so the rate has adjusted to our standard pricing of $129.99 for the Gig Internet package.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. I was never told that would happen. I mean, I've been with you guys for over a year now, and nobody said anything about a price increase. That's... that's not fair.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me check your account notes here to see... (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like the promotional terms would have been included in your service agreement when you signed up. Usually these are noted in the paperwork or in the welcome email that's sent when the account is activated.

Customer: I mean, maybe it was in some fine print somewhere, but I don't remember seeing anything about it doubling basically. Can I get it back to the old price?

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, the promotional rate has expired, so I can't retroactively apply that. However, I do want to help make this right. Let me see what options we have available to you right now... (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I can offer you a new promotional rate. We have a current offer for our valued customers of $89.99 for the next twelve months on the same Gig Internet service. That would save you forty dollars a month compared to the regular rate.

Customer: So that's still ten dollars more than what I was paying before.

Agent: Yes, that's correct. The first promotional period is typically our lowest rate, and this new rate is the best I can offer you right now for an existing customer.

Customer: Hmm... (pause) Well, I mean, that's better than the $129.99, but I'm still not thrilled about it. How long until that would expire?

Agent: This new promotional rate would be good for twelve months, so it would expire next year at this time. At that point, if you wanted to keep the service, we'd be back to standard pricing.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, so you're saying I'd be looking at another increase in a year?

Agent: That's possible, yes. However, promotions do vary based on what we have available. When that time comes, you could always give us a call and we can see what options might be available to you then. A lot of customers are able to work something out.

Customer: That doesn't really sound like a guarantee though...

Agent: No, I can't guarantee anything for future promotions, but I can tell you that many customers are able to find rates they're happy with when they contact us. And in the meantime, this $89.99 rate would give you some relief from the current standard rate.

Customer: (long pause) Alright, fine. I mean, I don't love it, but I guess it's better than nothing. Can you go ahead and apply that?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll get that set up for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm applying the $89.99 promotional rate to your account for the next twelve months, effective with your next billing cycle. That should be... let me see... that would be next month. So you'll see that rate reflected on your statement in about a month.

Customer: Wait, so I still have to pay the $129.99 this month? For this bill that's already been generated?

Agent: (pause) Well, the way it typically works is the promotional rate would apply going forward from when I'm processing it. So yes, this month's bill would still be at the higher rate. However, let me see if I can do something for you here... (typing sounds) You know what, let me apply a one-time credit to your account for the difference between what you would have paid on the promotional rate and what you're being charged this month. That would be about $40.

Customer: Oh. Okay, well, that's... that's actually helpful. So you can do that?

Agent: I can, and I'm going to do that for you right now as a gesture of goodwill, since you've been a good customer with us. (typing sounds) Alright, so I've applied a $40 credit to your account, which should show up within the next one or two billing cycles. So this month you'll see the credit applied, which should bring your bill down to around $89.99 effectively.

Customer: (pause) Well, okay. I appreciate that. That makes me feel a little better about the situation.

Agent: I'm glad. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Chen?

Customer: No, I think that's it. But just... maybe next time you could send something a little more obvious about when these promotional rates are ending? Because the way I found out about it was just seeing the charge on my bill.

Agent: That's actually really good feedback. I'll make a note on your account about that. And you know, honestly, I think a lot of customers would appreciate more of a heads-up about that. I'm sorry you had to deal with that surprise.

Customer: Yeah, well, thanks for working with me on it, I guess. I appreciate the credit.

Agent: You're welcome. And remember, you've got that new promotional rate for the next year, so you should be all set. If you have any issues with your service or if you have any other questions down the road, please don't hesitate to give us a call.

Customer: Alright, will do. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, Mr. Chen. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
