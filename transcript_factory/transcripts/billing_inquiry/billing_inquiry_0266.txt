Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I noticed my internet bill went up like thirty dollars. I haven't added any services or anything, so I'm not sure why that happened.

Agent: I understand your concern. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) And your name?

Customer: It's Patricia Chen.

Agent: Okay, Patricia, thank you. (pause) (typing) I'm looking at your account now. I can see you've been with us for about three years. Is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's about right. And I've never had any issues before. My bill was steady at like $79.99 every month, and suddenly this month it's like $109.

Agent: Yeah, I see that here. Okay, so your service is our Gig Fiber plan with the promotional pricing. (pause) It looks like your promotional rate of $79.99 ended last month. That was a 12-month promotional rate that you signed up for back in 2021.

Customer: Oh... I didn't... I mean, nobody told me about that. Like, how is that fair? The promotion just ends and suddenly my bill jumps?

Agent: I totally understand your frustration, Patricia. The promotional rates are definitely advertised upfront, but I realize it can be easy to forget about when you've been on the service for a while. Unfortunately, the regular price for the Gig Fiber plan is $109.99 per month, which is where your bill has moved to now.

Customer: But that's ridiculous. That's like a 40% increase. Can't you do something? I mean, I've been a good customer.

Agent: (pause) You know what, let me see what options I have available for you here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at some promotional offers we currently have available. Since you're an existing customer... (pause) I can offer you an extended promotion. We have a three-month promotional rate of $89.99 that I can apply to your account right now.

Customer: Three months? That's it? And then what, my bill goes back up again?

Agent: That's correct. After the three-month period, it would return to the regular rate of $109.99. However, at that time you could call back in and we often have other promotional offers available. But I'm being honest with you—I can't guarantee what we'd have at that point.

Customer: (sighs) This is frustrating. I called Verizon yesterday and they're offering me their Fios service for $79.99 with a two-year lock-in. I'm really thinking about switching.

Agent: (pause) I hear you, and I appreciate you giving us the opportunity to work with you. Let me see if I can do a little better here. (typing sounds) Can you hold for just one moment while I check with my supervisor about what other options might be available?

Customer: Um, sure. How long will that take?

Agent: Should be just a couple minutes.

Customer: Okay, fine.

Agent: Thank you, Patricia. Please hold.

(hold music plays for approximately 90 seconds)

Agent: (returns) Thanks for your patience, Patricia. Okay, so I spoke with my supervisor, and because you're a three-year customer with a good payment history, I can offer you a six-month promotional rate of $84.99 per month instead.

Customer: Six months?

Agent: Yes, six months. And after that, if you stay with us, we can definitely discuss other options at that time. I know it's not a perfect solution, but it does get you closer to what you were paying before.

Customer: (pause) So after six months, I'm back to $109.99?

Agent: That's correct, unless we have another promotion available at that time. But you'd have the option to call in and work with us on that.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I guess... I mean, that's better than the jump to $109. But you guys really should give customers more notice about these things ending. I almost switched providers today.

Agent: You know, that's really valid feedback, and I appreciate that. That's actually something I hear from customers fairly regularly. I can make a note on your account about your feedback regarding promotion notifications. And look, I'm glad we were able to work something out.

Customer: Alright, okay. So you're applying this $84.99 rate starting with my next bill?

Agent: Yes, exactly. Starting with your next billing cycle. You should see that reflected on your next statement. Let me just confirm the details here. (typing) Your new promotional rate of $84.99 per month will be active for six billing cycles. And then after that—

Customer: —we can work something out. I got it.

Agent: Exactly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Patricia. And again, I really do appreciate your loyalty as a customer. We value you. If you have any issues with your service or have any questions in the future, please don't hesitate to give us a call back.

Customer: Will do. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, Patricia. Thank you for calling Frontier.
