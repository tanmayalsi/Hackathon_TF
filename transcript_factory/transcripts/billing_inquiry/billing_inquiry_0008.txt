Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill this morning and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I need to figure out what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. The account is under Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Jennifer, I'm pulling up your account now. Just one second... Alright, I've got you here. You're in the Riverside area, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize. Can you tell me which charge you're looking at?

Customer: Well, that's the thing. My bill went up by thirty dollars this month. I was paying $79.99 for the internet, and now it's showing $109.99. I haven't added any services or anything. I want to know why that happened.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Jennifer. Let me take a look at what might have caused that increase. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that your promotional rate expired. You were on an introductory rate of $79.99 per month for twelve months, and that period ended with your last billing cycle. Your regular rate for our Gig Fiber service is $109.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't agree to any introductory rate. I've been a customer for... I don't even know how long. This is ridiculous.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Let me check your account history to see exactly when you signed up. (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like you've been with us for about fourteen months now. You did sign up for our new customer promotion, which was twelve months at the introductory price of $79.99. After that period, the rate moves to the standard rate, which is what you're seeing now.

Customer: That's... I don't remember that at all. Who signs up knowing their bill is going to jump thirty dollars? That seems like a scam to me.

Agent: I hear you, and I know that can be frustrating when the promotional period ends. However, this is standard practice across the industry. The promotional rates are typically disclosed at the time of signup. Do you happen to remember receiving any notices about this?

Customer: Maybe? I mean, I get so many emails from you guys. But nobody ever called me to remind me before this happened. You'd think you'd reach out before just... charging me more money.

Agent: That's fair feedback, Jennifer. And I appreciate that. What I can do is... let me see what options we have available for you. (typing sounds) So, we do have some current promotions running. I'm not able to honor the previous rate, but I can offer you a special rate of $89.99 per month for the next twelve months. That would bring your bill down from the $109.99. How does that sound?

Customer: So it's going to go back up again after twelve months?

Agent: Yes, after the twelve-month promotional period, it would go back to the standard rate of $109.99 per month, unless there are other promotions available at that time.

Customer: (sighs) I don't know. This just feels like... you're just looking to trap people into higher rates. But I guess $89.99 is better than $109.99. Can I get that credit applied?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to go ahead and apply that rate to your account right now. (typing sounds) And what I'm going to do is also apply a one-time credit of $30 to your account to cover the difference from this billing cycle. So your account will show a credit, and your next bill will reflect the new rate of $89.99. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, okay. I appreciate that. But seriously, you should call customers before you hike their rates. It's not right.

Agent: I really do appreciate that feedback, Jennifer, and I'm going to make a note of that on your account. It's valuable input. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. When will the credit show up?

Agent: The credit should be reflected on your next bill, which will be generated on the 15th of next month. And the new rate of $89.99 will also start with that same billing cycle. You should see everything reflected when you get that bill.

Customer: Okay. Thank you for fixing it... I guess.

Agent: You're welcome, Jennifer. And again, I'm sorry for the frustration. If you have any other issues or questions, please don't hesitate to call us back. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's all.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and thank you for being a customer. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
