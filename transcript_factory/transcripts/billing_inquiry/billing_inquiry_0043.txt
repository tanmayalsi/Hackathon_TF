Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I just got charged way more than I'm supposed to be paying, and I'm really frustrated about it.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number for the service.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for your residential fiber service at... (pause) ...1428 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. So I'm looking at your account here. I can see you received your most recent bill on the 15th. Walk me through what you're seeing that's concerning you.

Customer: Okay, so my bill was supposed to be $79.99 a month for the fiber plan—that's what I signed up for. But this month it jumped to $99.99. That's a twenty dollar increase! And I didn't authorize any changes or anything. Nobody called me, nobody emailed me. I just... I open the bill and boom, it's twenty bucks more.

Agent: (pause) I hear you. That's definitely unexpected. Let me take a look at what triggered this change. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that on your account, you were enrolled in a promotional rate that expired. Your promotional period was 12 months, and it looks like that ended on the 10th of this month.

Customer: Wait, what? Promotional period? I wasn't told it was promotional. I thought that was my regular price.

Agent: I understand why that would be frustrating. Let me look at the notes here from when your account was set up... (pause) Okay, so the promotional rate of $79.99 was for 12 months from your installation date, which was back in January of last year. After the promotional period ends, the rate does increase to our standard fiber rate, which is $99.99 per month.

Customer: But I literally was never told about this. If I'd known it was going to jump twenty bucks, I wouldn't have... I mean, I probably would've shopped around or something. That's not fair. I've been a good customer. I pay my bill on time every month.

Agent: And I really do appreciate your loyalty. Let me see what I can do for you here. (typing sounds) So typically, when a promotional rate expires, we do send out a notice about 30 days before the change takes effect. Let me check if that notice was sent to you...

Customer: Well, I definitely didn't get anything in the mail. And my email—I might get your statements, but I don't remember seeing anything about a rate increase.

Agent: (pause) Okay. Unfortunately, I'm showing that the notice was sent to both your email on file and mailed to your service address. But I hear what you're saying, and I do want to help. What I can do is offer you a courtesy credit for the overage this month—so that $20 difference—and I can look into options to help reduce your rate going forward.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, well that's something, I guess. But I mean, what are my options? Like, can I get back to the $79.99?

Agent: That's a great question. So the promotional rate was specific to that first-year offer, so I wouldn't be able to reinstate that exact rate. However, I do have some options available. I can look at bundling your service with other products, or I can see if there's a current promotion running that I can apply to your account. Let me check what we have available right now...

Customer: Okay, yeah, please do. Because honestly, $99.99 is a lot more than what I was expecting to pay going forward.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, so I'm looking at our current offerings, and we do have a promotion running for existing customers. I can offer you a rate of $89.99 per month for the next 12 months, which would get you back closer to what you were paying. That would be a locked-in rate for a year. After that year expires, the rate would go to the standard $99.99 again, but at least that gives you a bit of breathing room. How does that sound?

Customer: So it's $89.99 for a year, and then it goes back up to $99.99?

Agent: That's correct, yes. But honestly, at that point, you could always give us a call and we could look at other options or promotions that might be available then. Many customers do that, and we're usually able to work with them.

Customer: (pause) I mean... I guess that's better than $99.99 right now. But I'm not thrilled about the whole situation. I feel like this should've been communicated better.

Agent: I absolutely hear you, and your feedback is valuable. This is something we're always trying to improve on. But I do appreciate your patience, and I think this is a fair solution. So let me put this promotion on your account right now, and I'll also apply that $20 credit for this month. Your next bill should reflect the $89.99 rate.

Customer: Okay... how long does it take for that to show up?

Agent: Your next billing cycle starts on the 15th, and that's when you'll see the new rate applied. You should receive that bill by around the 20th of next month. If for some reason you don't see it, just give us a call back and we can check on it.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. I guess I'm a bit less frustrated now, but I really do think you guys need to do a better job with these notifications.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm going to make a note on your account about this conversation so that our management is aware of your feedback. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for at least trying to make it right.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for your business, and again, I apologize for the confusion around the rate change. We appreciate you as a customer, and if you ever have any issues going forward, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Thank you, and have a great day!
