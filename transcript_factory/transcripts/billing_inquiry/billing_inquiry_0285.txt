Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I just got my bill and... I'm pretty frustrated, honestly. My bill went up like thirty dollars this month and I have no idea why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to help you figure that out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, thank you Michael. Let me just... (pause) ...okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see your last bill was $89.99 and this month it's showing $119.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. Thirty bucks more. I haven't changed anything. I'm still on the same internet plan, the same speeds, everything. I don't understand where this is coming from.

Agent: I totally understand your concern. Let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so looking at your account history, I can see that your promotional rate expired. You had a twelve-month promotional offer that ended this month.

Customer: Wait, what? I never agreed to a promotional rate. I thought that was my regular price.

Agent: I can see why that would be confusing. (pause) The promotional pricing is clearly listed here in your account notes. It looks like it started back in... February of last year, so the twelve months would have ended at the end of this billing cycle. Your regular rate is $119.99 for the Gig Speed fiber package with our basic TV and phone bundle.

Customer: Okay, but I mean... nobody told me this was happening. I didn't get any kind of warning or notice. I just opened my bill and saw the charge.

Agent: That's a fair point. Let me see if there's a note here about notification... (typing sounds) Hmm, it looks like there should have been a notice included with your bill about three months ago and then another one at thirty days before the change took effect. Did you happen to see those?

Customer: I... maybe? I don't know, I get a lot of mail. But shouldn't Frontier have called me or emailed me or something? This is a pretty big jump.

Agent: You know what, Michael, that's actually really good feedback, and I understand your frustration. We do send out notices, but I agree that an email heads-up would be helpful too. What I can do for you right now is... let me look at what options we have available. (typing sounds, pause) 

Customer: I mean, what are my options? Can you just put me back on the promotional rate?

Agent: Unfortunately, I can't retroactively apply a promotional rate, but what I can do is check if we have any current promotions I can offer you. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so right now we do have a promotion available. I can get you back down to $99.99 for the next six months for the same package. After that, it would go back to the regular rate of $119.99, but at least that gives you a little bit of a break.

Customer: Six months? That's it?

Agent: That's what we have available right now, yes. It's our standard retention offer for customers in your situation. After that six months, your rate would return to $119.99.

Customer: (pause) Okay, well... that's better than paying $120 right now, I guess. But I'm not happy about this. I feel like I should have been told more clearly that this was coming.

Agent: And I really do appreciate that feedback. I'm going to make a note in your account about your concern regarding the notification process, and I'll make sure that's flagged for our customer service team. Your concern is valid. Now, the other thing I want to ask you about is... are you happy with your service itself? The internet speeds, the reliability?

Customer: Yeah, the internet's fine. No complaints there. It's just... I don't like surprise price increases.

Agent: That makes total sense. Well, I'm going to go ahead and apply this six-month promotional rate for you. That'll bring your bill down to $99.99. The new rate will start on your next billing cycle, which should be... let me see here... that would be [inaudible] next week. So your next bill should reflect that change.

Customer: Okay. And then after six months, I need to call back and try to negotiate again?

Agent: Well, you're welcome to call us anytime if you want to discuss options. At that point, we may have additional promotions available, or we might be able to work out something else. But yes, at minimum, I'd recommend reaching out before your rate goes back up to the full $119.99 so we can explore what we can do for you at that time.

Customer: (sighs) Alright. Well, I guess I appreciate you at least putting me on the promotional rate. This whole thing could have been handled better on your end, but... I appreciate it.

Agent: I really do appreciate your patience, Michael, and I apologize again for the confusion with the notifications. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business. You should see that rate change reflected on your next bill. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to give us a call back anytime.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Have a great day, Michael.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye!
