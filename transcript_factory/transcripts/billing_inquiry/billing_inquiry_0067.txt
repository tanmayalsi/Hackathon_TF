Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. It's for like, $47 and some change, and I don't know what it is.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you figure this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And what's the best name to have on the account?

Customer: It's James Chen.

Agent: Perfect, James. Let me pull up your account here. (brief pause) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see your recent bill from March 1st. Can you tell me what date you're looking at, or is it this most recent one?

Customer: Yeah, the one from March 1st. That's the one that came yesterday.

Agent: Alright, I'm looking at it right now. I'm seeing your regular service charges, your internet plan at $79.99... Can you tell me which specific charge is looking unfamiliar to you?

Customer: Um, there's one that says... "Equipment Service Fee" and it's $47.50. I mean, I've been with you guys for like three years and I've never seen this before. What is that?

Agent: (pause) Okay, let me look into that for you. So that would be for... (typing sounds) Ah, I see what happened here. It looks like that's for a modem replacement that was ordered to your account about two weeks ago.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't order a modem. I don't need a new modem. My internet is working fine.

Agent: I understand. Let me look at the notes here... (pause) It says here that a technician recommended a modem upgrade during a service call on February 15th. Do you remember having a technician out at your home?

Customer: Oh, yeah, actually I did. But he just came out because I was having some slow speeds one day. He didn't ask me if I wanted to replace the modem. He just... I don't know, he looked at it and left. Nobody ever told me I was going to be charged $47 for a modem.

Agent: I totally understand your frustration, James. So it sounds like there may have been a miscommunication during that service visit. The modem upgrade should have been discussed with you and you should have agreed to it before any charges were applied. That's definitely on us.

Customer: Right, so can you remove the charge? Because again, my internet is working fine. I don't need a new modem.

Agent: (pause) Absolutely. Let me see what I can do here. I'm going to note this as a disputed charge due to lack of authorization. (typing sounds) I can go ahead and credit that $47.50 back to your account right now. That should post within one to two billing cycles.

Customer: Okay, that's good. But I'm also a little concerned because, like, didn't my bill also go up? I feel like it used to be cheaper.

Agent: That's a good question. Let me take a look at your billing history here. (pause) So looking back... your internet service was previously at $69.99 per month, and it's now at $79.99. So that's a $10 increase.

Customer: Yeah, see, that's what I thought. When did that happen?

Agent: (typing sounds) It looks like that took effect starting with your February 1st billing cycle. So that would have been about a month ago. You should have received a notice about that, but let me check... (pause) It looks like it was sent via email on January 24th.

Customer: I don't remember getting that email. But, I mean, what's the reason for the increase? That seems like a lot.

Agent: So that increase is due to an upgrade to our service tier in your area. You were automatically moved to our newer Fiber 300 plan, which provides faster speeds and more reliable service than your previous plan.

Customer: I didn't ask to be upgraded, though. I was fine with my old speeds.

Agent: I hear you. I understand this is frustrating. Unfortunately, the upgrade was applied to all customers in your service area as part of our infrastructure improvements. But what I can do is... (pause) let me see what options we have. Do you want me to look into whether we can move you back to a lower-tier plan?

Customer: How much lower are we talking?

Agent: We have a Fiber 100 plan that's $59.99 per month, or we also have our Fiber 200 plan at $69.99, which would get you back to your previous price point.

Customer: Wait, so the Fiber 200 is the same price as what I was paying before?

Agent: Correct, yes. And the Fiber 200 plan will give you faster speeds than your original plan, so it's actually a better value.

Customer: Okay, well that makes sense. Yeah, let's do that. Put me on the Fiber 200 plan.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to make that change for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so what I've done is I've credited the $47.50 equipment fee, and I've moved you to our Fiber 200 plan at $69.99 per month, which will start on your next billing cycle, April 1st. So your bill should go back to what you're used to paying.

Customer: Okay, great. And just to confirm, I don't have to do anything, right? Like, I don't need to send back the modem or anything?

Agent: No, you're all set. That modem will stay with you, and you can use it on the Fiber 200 plan without any issues. It's actually a pretty nice unit, so you got a good one there.

Customer: (laughs) Well, I guess that's one silver lining. Okay, I appreciate you taking care of this, Derek. This was helpful.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. And again, I apologize for the confusion on the service call and the communication about the billing changes. I've made notes on your account about all of this, so if you have any other issues, the next representative will be aware. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and thank you for being a loyal customer. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
