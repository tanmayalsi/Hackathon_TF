Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I'm really frustrated with my bill. I was charged... I think there's a mistake or something. My internet bill just went up like thirty dollars out of nowhere, and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me just pull that up here... And just to confirm, is this a residential account?

Customer: Yes, it's my home internet.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I see your current plan is our Gigabit Fiber package. Can you tell me what your bill was before, and what you're being charged now?

Customer: Well, I mean, for like the past year or so I was paying... I think it was like $79.99 a month? And this month it jumped to $109.99. That's almost thirty dollars more. I didn't agree to any price increase, and honestly, I'm considering switching providers at this point.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me take a look at what happened here. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional pricing expired. You had an introductory rate for the first twelve months, and that ended with your last billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't... I mean, nobody told me that was going to happen. Why would they set that up?

Agent: I apologize for the confusion. So typically when a customer signs up, they receive promotional pricing for the first year, and then it transitions to our standard pricing after that period ends. You should have received a notice about thirty days before the promotion ended. Do you recall receiving anything in the mail or email about this?

Customer: (pause) Well... maybe? I get a lot of mail, and my email is kind of out of control, to be honest. But still, this is... I mean, that's a huge jump. That doesn't seem right.

Agent: I hear you. That is a significant increase, and I definitely want to help make this right. Let me see what options I can find for you. One moment, please.

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, so I've got a few things I can do here. Since you've been a loyal customer for over a year now, I can actually apply a loyalty promotion to your account. We have a rate that would bring you down to $89.99 per month for the next twelve months.

Customer: $89.99? So that's still ten dollars more than what I was paying before.

Agent: Yes, I understand. However, this would be significantly better than the $109.99 rate you're currently at. And unfortunately, the original introductory rate is only available to new customers. But I want to be transparent with you—after this twelve-month period, the rate would adjust again to the standard rate.

Customer: (sighs) This is... I don't know. It's kind of frustrating. Why is there so much fine print with this stuff? Can't you just keep me at the original rate?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Believe me, if I could lock you in at the original price permanently, I would. Unfortunately, promotional pricing does have an expiration date, and that's set by our pricing department. But what I can do is make sure you're on the best rate I'm able to offer right now, which is that $89.99, and you'll receive a courtesy call or notification thirty days before that rate expires so you won't be surprised again.

Customer: (pause) Well... I mean, at least you're trying to help. Can I think about it? I might still want to look at other options.

Agent: Absolutely, that's completely fair. You have time to decide. But let me ask—are you happy with the service quality itself? Like, the speed and reliability?

Customer: Yeah, actually, the internet has been great. No complaints there. It's really just the price thing that's bugging me.

Agent: Okay, that's good to hear. And honestly, for fiber internet, $89.99 is a pretty competitive rate in your area. If you do shop around, you might find that our pricing is actually quite reasonable. But I get it—you want the best deal possible.

Customer: Yeah, well, when you put it that way... (pause) Okay, you know what? Go ahead and apply that promotion. I'll take the $89.99.

Agent: Great, I'm really glad we could work something out. Let me get that set up for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm applying the loyalty rate of $89.99 per month to your account. This will be effective on your next billing cycle, which starts on... (pause) ...the 15th of next month. You'll see this reflected on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, great. And you said I'd get a notice before it changes again?

Agent: That's right. We'll send you a notice at least thirty days before the promotional period ends so you're not caught off guard. And if you have any concerns before then, or if you just want to explore other options, feel free to give us a call back anytime.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. Thank you for your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business. You have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
