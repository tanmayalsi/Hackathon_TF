# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, so I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I absolutely don't recognize. I've been a customer for like, three years now, and my bill has never been this high.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you figure this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... um, it's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. And just to confirm, is this the account for your residence at 412 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. Let me pull up your recent billing here. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your last statement. I can see your account. What specific charge are you seeing that seems off to you?

Customer: Well, the whole thing. I mean, normally I pay like $89.99 for my internet, right? But this month it's like $129. That's a forty dollar jump! I don't... I didn't agree to any changes or anything.

Agent: I understand that would be frustrating. Let me take a closer look at what happened here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate did expire at the end of last month. You had a promotional pricing of $89.99 for 24 months, and that period ended on March 31st.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me that was ending. I mean, nobody called me or sent me anything about that.

Agent: I apologize for the confusion. We do typically send notifications when a promotional rate is expiring. Let me check when that notification was sent out. (pause) It looks like a notice was sent to your email address on file about 30 days prior, which would have been back in early March.

Customer: Well, I didn't see it. My email gets a ton of stuff, you know? And honestly, I think that's kind of shady. If you're gonna raise my rates, you should probably call people or send something more obvious than an email.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I appreciate that feedback. You're right that a price increase is definitely something we should communicate clearly about. After the promotional period ends, your rate does go to our standard pricing, which for your service level in your area is $129.99 per month.

Customer: So that's just... it? You're charging me an extra $40 and that's just how it is?

Agent: Well, let me see what options I have available for you. (typing sounds) (pause) You know what, I'd like to look into what we can do here. I do see that we have some loyalty offers available to customers who've been with us for a few years. Since you've been with us for three years, you are eligible for a discounted rate. Let me check what I can apply to your account.

Customer: Okay, yeah. I mean, I just... I liked the price I was paying before, you know?

Agent: Absolutely. I get that completely. (pause) Okay, so what I can do is offer you a new promotional rate of $99.99 per month for the next 12 months. This would be a two-year commitment, but it would bring your bill down from the $129.99 to $99.99. That's still a $10 increase from what you were paying, but it's significantly better than the standard rate that just kicked in.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) I mean, that's better than $129, but I'm still not thrilled about paying more than I was.

Agent: I hear you. And I wish I could keep you at the original rate, but unfortunately I'm limited in how far back I can go with pricing. This is the best offer I'm able to extend to you right now as a loyalty customer.

Customer: [inaudible] ...and then what happens after a year? Does it jump up again?

Agent: That's a great question. So after the 12-month promotional period ends, your rate would revert to our standard pricing again unless we have another promotion available at that time. But I would recommend keeping an eye on your email for renewal notices, or you could always call us in about 11 months and we can review your options again.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, well... I guess that's something. Can you at least make sure I get a better notification this time when it's about to expire?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to make a note on your account right now requesting that we contact you via phone 60 days before your promotional period ends. That way you'll have plenty of time to decide what you want to do. Is the phone number we have on file still the best number to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, 555-0147 is actually my cell phone, so that works.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap what we've done here today: I've applied a promotional rate of $99.99 per month to your account for the next 12 months. This will be reflected on your next billing cycle. And I've added a note that we should contact you via phone 60 days before the promotion expires.

Customer: Okay. And you're sure this is the best you can do?

Agent: For a 12-month commitment, yes, this is the best offer I have available for your account. However, if you'd like, I can also transfer you to our retention department and they may have some additional options, but I have to be honest with you... they typically work with customers who are looking to cancel service. They might not be able to offer you anything better.

Customer: No, no, that's okay. I'll just stick with what you're offering. I appreciate you at least trying to work with me on this.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm sorry about the surprise with the rate increase. I really do apologize that the first notification didn't reach you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and thank you for being a loyal customer. You have a great day!

Customer: You too, Derek. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
