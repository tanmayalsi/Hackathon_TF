Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I just received my latest statement and there's a charge on here that wasn't on my bill last month, and I'm not sure what it is.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Sarah Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. Let me pull up your account here... (pause) Alright, I've got you here. I can see your service at 1847 Maple Drive. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So, you mentioned there's a charge you're concerned about. What month is your current bill for?

Customer: It's for November. My October bill was $79.99, which is what I've been paying for like, the past year or so. But now this month it jumped to $94.99. That's fifteen dollars more, and I have no idea why.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me take a look at what happened between those two months. (pause) I'm seeing here... yes, so it looks like there was a promotional rate that expired on your account. You had a promotional pricing of $79.99 for twelve months, and that promotion ended with your October billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me you just... automatically raised my price? I didn't agree to this. Nobody called me or sent me anything about this.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Sarah. (pause) Let me check your account notes here to see if there was any notification sent... (typing sounds) So, the terms of the promotion would have been outlined in your original agreement, and typically we do send notifications before a promotional period ends, but let me see if I can find documentation of that...

Customer: I mean, I don't remember signing up for anything temporary. I thought that was just my rate. I've been a customer for over a year, and my bill was always the same.

Agent: I completely understand. You know, these promotions can be confusing, and I apologize if the communication wasn't as clear as it should have been. The good news is that I can absolutely help you here. Let me see what options we have available for you.

Customer: Okay, what kind of options?

Agent: (typing sounds) So, we have a few things we can do. First, let me check if there are any current promotions I can apply to your account... (pause) Great, so I'm seeing we do have a promotion available right now. I could offer you $84.99 per month for another twelve months. That's a ten dollar reduction from the current rate.

Customer: So that's still higher than what I was paying before.

Agent: You're right, it is. The previous promotional rate of $79.99 is no longer available in our system, unfortunately. But the $84.99 is the best rate I can offer you at this time. However... (pause) let me see if I can add anything else to help make up the difference. Do you currently have our phone service?

Customer: No, I just have the internet.

Agent: Okay. Well, if you're interested, I could bundle internet and phone together, which would actually bring your total down to about $89.99, and that would include unlimited local and long distance calling.

Customer: (pause) I don't really want a phone line. I have my cell phone. Can't you just... I don't know, honor the old price? I've been a good customer. I haven't missed a payment or anything.

Agent: I really wish I could do that for you, Sarah. I do. But promotional pricing is only valid for the specific term that it was set for. However... (typing sounds) let me see what my options are here as a courtesy. (pause) What I can do is apply a one-time account credit of $25 to help offset this increase.

Customer: $25? That barely covers one month's difference.

Agent: I know it's not perfect, but that's really the best courtesy adjustment I'm authorized to make. And then with the $84.99 rate I mentioned, you'd be at least $10 lower than your current bill. So combined with the credit, you'd get some relief right away.

Customer: (pause) So if I take the $84.99 rate, when does that start?

Agent: That would start on your next billing cycle, which would be December. And the $25 credit would be applied to your November statement, so you'd see that reflected when you get your next bill.

Customer: And this rate is for how long?

Agent: This would be for another twelve months at that $84.99 price.

Customer: (pause) Okay, um... I guess that's better than nothing. But I'm not happy about this. You really should notify customers before you do stuff like this.

Agent: I completely agree with you, and I appreciate that feedback. I'm going to make a note on your account about your concerns. Can I go ahead and apply that $84.99 promotion and the $25 credit for you?

Customer: Yeah, fine. Go ahead.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm processing that now... (pause) Okay, all set. So to confirm, your new rate is $84.99 per month for the next twelve months, starting with your December billing cycle. You'll see the $25 credit on your November bill. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I really would have appreciated a heads up about this.

Agent: I understand completely, and again, I'm sorry about that. I've added your feedback to the account, and we will make sure you're contacted before any promotional changes in the future. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, Sarah, and I apologize for the frustration.

Customer: Okay. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day.

Customer: You too.
