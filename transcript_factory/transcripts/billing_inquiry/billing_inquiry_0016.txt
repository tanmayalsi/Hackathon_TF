Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize. It's for like forty-five dollars and I have no idea what it's for.

Agent: I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one second here... Got it. Account for James Mitchell?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, James. I'm pulling up your most recent bill now. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at your account. Can you tell me which charge you're questioning? Is it on your current bill for this month?

Customer: Yeah, it's the current bill. It's like... it says "equipment maintenance fee" for forty-five dollars. I've been with you guys for three years and I've never seen this charge before. What is that?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me explain that for you. (pause) So the equipment maintenance fee is actually... it's something we've been rolling out over the past few months. It covers the modem and router maintenance and support for our fiber customers.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. I'm already paying for internet service. Why am I now paying extra for the equipment? That doesn't make sense.

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from. So it's a separate service that covers—

Customer: —No, I mean, I have homeowners insurance. I don't need additional insurance on my modem. Can't you just remove it?

Agent: (pause) Okay, so it's not exactly insurance, James. It's more of a maintenance and support package. If your modem or router fails, we replace it at no cost to you under this plan. Previously, customers who needed a replacement device would—

Customer: I still don't want it. I've had the same modem for three years without any issues. I'm not paying forty-five dollars a month for something I don't need.

Agent: (typing sounds) I hear you. Let me see what I can do here. One moment, please. (brief hold music plays) Thank you for holding. So I can remove that charge for you, but I do want to mention that if your modem does fail, you would be responsible for the replacement fee, which is typically around eighty to one hundred twenty dollars.

Customer: I'll take that risk. I just don't want to pay forty-five dollars every month for something I'm not using.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to go ahead and remove that from your account right now. (typing sounds) But I also want to let you know that we are also implementing a price increase for fiber internet service starting next month. Your current rate is $79.99 a month, and it will be increasing to $94.99.

Customer: Are you kidding me right now? So you're removing one charge and adding a bigger one? What's going on with you guys?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, James. Unfortunately, the rate increase is company-wide due to infrastructure investments and network improvements we're making in your area. However, I do have some options for you. If you'd be willing to sign up for an additional service—

Customer: —Like what? I don't need additional services. I just need my internet. How much longer is this increase happening?

Agent: (pause) The rate increase will be indefinite unless there are any promotional rates available in the future. However, I can offer you a loyalty discount of ten dollars per month for the next twelve months if you commit to staying with us for another year.

Customer: So that would bring it down to... eighty-four ninety-nine?

Agent: Yes, exactly. $84.99 per month for the next year, and then it would go to the regular $94.99 after that.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm losing the forty-five dollar equipment fee, which is good, but I'm paying about five dollars more than I was before. That's... I mean, it's not great, but I guess it's better than the full increase.

Agent: I appreciate your understanding, James. And I want to make sure—are you satisfied with the internet service itself? Has your speed been good?

Customer: Yeah, the internet's fine. It's fast and reliable. I'm not complaining about the service. I just don't like being nickel and dimed.

Agent: That's completely fair. I've removed the equipment maintenance fee from your account effective immediately. Your next bill will reflect that credit, and the ten-dollar loyalty discount will start on your next billing cycle. So you're looking at $84.99 per month going forward for the next twelve months.

Customer: Okay. And just to be clear—if I don't commit to the year, the increase goes into effect right away at the full amount?

Agent: Correct. If you don't want to commit to the year, the full increase to $94.99 would start on your next bill.

Customer: Alright, I'll do the year commitment. But I want this documented in case there's any confusion next month.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm putting a note in your account right now that you've committed to the loyalty rate. You should receive a confirmation email within the next 24 hours outlining all the changes we've made today.

Customer: Okay. Thank you, Derek. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything.

Agent: Great. Well, thank you for being a valued Frontier customer for three years, and we appreciate your continued business. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye, James. Have a great day.
