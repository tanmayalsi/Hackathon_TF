Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I was absolutely shocked. My internet bill went up by thirty dollars a month. Thirty dollars! And nobody told me about this.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I completely understand. Let me pull up your account here so I can take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service address on Maple Street in Portland?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account now. So I see your most recent bill is $129.99, and you're saying that's higher than your previous bill?

Customer: Way higher! Last month it was ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents. I've been paying that for like... a year and a half now. So what's the deal? Did you guys just randomly decide to raise my rates?

Agent: Okay, let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) I'm checking the billing history here. So I'm seeing that you were on our promotional rate of $99.99 for the first twelve months of service. That promotion ended on your account about six weeks ago, which is when your standard rate kicked in at $129.99.

Customer: Six weeks? (pause) I never got notified about that. That's... I mean, I would've appreciated some kind of heads up before it just showed up on my bill like this.

Agent: I completely hear you on that, and I apologize. You should have received a notification at least thirty days before your promotional rate expired. Let me check... (typing sounds) I'm not seeing a record of notification being sent. That's on us. I apologize for that.

Customer: So what are you going to do about it? I can't just absorb a thirty dollar increase every month. That's almost four hundred dollars a year more.

Agent: That's a fair point. Let me see what options I have available for you. (pause) So, the good news is I do have the ability to adjust your rate. I can't put you back on the original promotional rate since that's expired, but I do have a current customer retention offer that I can apply to your account that would bring your monthly bill down to $114.99.

Customer: $114.99? So that's still a fifteen dollar increase from what I was paying.

Agent: Yes, that's correct. Unfortunately, I can't match the promotional rate exactly once it's expired. However, this retention rate is our best available offer for keeping you as a valued customer. And this would be locked in for another twelve months at that price.

Customer: (sighs) And what do I have to do to get this rate?

Agent: Nothing at all. I can apply it right now to your account. It would go into effect on your next billing cycle, so you should see it reflected on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, but what about this current bill? I mean, I still got charged the full $129.99 for a service that I didn't know was going to increase.

Agent: That's a very valid concern. What I can do is issue you a credit for the difference between what you paid and what you would've paid on a regular customer rate. So that would be a credit of fifteen dollars and that will appear on your next bill as well. How does that sound?

Customer: Fifteen dollars? That's... it's something, I guess. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing.

Agent: I really do apologize again for the lack of notification. That should've been sent to you, and I'm making a note on your account so this doesn't happen in the future. Is there anything else I can help clarify about your billing?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. So just to confirm, my new rate is $114.99 starting next month?

Agent: That's right. $114.99 per month, locked in for twelve months. And you'll also see that fifteen dollar credit on your next bill. You should receive an updated bill summary via email or mail showing these changes.

Customer: Okay. I appreciate you working with me on this, Marcus. I still think you guys should've notified me, but I'm glad we got it sorted out.

Agent: I really appreciate your patience, and again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. We do value your business. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
