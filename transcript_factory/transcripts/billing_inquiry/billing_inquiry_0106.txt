# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I received my bill yesterday and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize, and also my internet bill went up. I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up real quick... All right, I've got your account here. Your name is Robert Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize and you've noticed an increase. Let me take a look at your most recent bill here. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your bill from last month was $79.99, and this month it's $94.99. Is that the increase you're referring to?

Customer: Yeah, that's it. Fifteen dollars more, and I don't... I mean, I didn't authorize any price increase. What's going on with that?

Agent: I understand your concern. So, looking at your account, I can see that you're on our standard Fiber 200 plan, which has always been $79.99. However, I'm noticing that back on March 15th, there was a promotional pricing period that ended on your account. You had been getting that rate as an introductory offer for the first year of service.

Customer: Wait, wait—I never agreed to that. Nobody told me my rate would go up after a year. That's... that's not right.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize if that wasn't made clear during your initial sign-up. Let me check your account notes here... (pause, typing) Okay, so according to our records, there should have been documentation sent to you about 30 days before the rate change. Did you happen to receive any notices in the mail or email?

Customer: I... maybe? Honestly, I get a lot of mail. I might have thrown something out. But that's pretty sneaky if you ask me. I signed up for $79.99, and that's what I should be paying.

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate your patience. This is definitely something we can work with. Let me just confirm—you mentioned there was also a charge you don't recognize?

Customer: Right, yeah. There's a $15 charge that just says "Equipment Fee" or something. I don't... I already have a modem. I've had the same modem for over a year. Why am I suddenly being charged for equipment?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me look at that... Hmm, that is odd. Looking at your equipment history, you're right—you've had the same Frontier-provided modem since your installation on... February 2023. There shouldn't be an additional equipment charge on your account. (pause) That looks like it might be a billing error on our end. I'm going to make a note of that right now.

Customer: So is that going to be removed?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. That charge should not be there, and I'm going to get that removed for you. That will take it down from $94.99 back to $79.99 for this month. As for the promotional rate ending... (pause) Let me see what I can do here. Since you feel like there wasn't adequate notice and you've been a good customer—I'm seeing you've been with us for over a year with no service issues—I'd like to offer you a couple of options.

Customer: Okay, what are the options?

Agent: Well, option one: I can extend your promotional rate of $79.99 for an additional six months. That would give you a little more time, and then it would adjust to our standard rate after that. Or, option two: I could look into putting you on a different plan structure that might work out better for your usage. What kind of speeds are you typically using?

Customer: Um, honestly, the 200 is fine. Like, I work from home and I stream stuff, and it's been great. I just don't want to pay more for the same thing, you know?

Agent: That makes total sense. Yeah, so in that case, I'd recommend going with option one—extending that promotional rate for another six months. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah. I mean, that's better than nothing. But I'm not thrilled that this happened in the first place. Can you guys send me something that clearly spells out what's happening after those six months? In writing?

Agent: Of course. I'm going to put a note on your account right now requesting that we send you an email notification, and we'll also include it with your bill statement for the next couple months leading up to the rate change. That way there's no surprises this time around.

Customer: All right. I appreciate that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. So, to recap what I've done for you today: First, I'm removing that erroneous $15 equipment fee from your bill. Second, I'm extending your promotional rate of $79.99 for an additional six months, which means your next bill should be $79.99. And third, I'm adding a note to make sure you get clear written notice before any future rate adjustments. Does that cover everything?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. When will I see the credit for that $15?

Agent: The credit should appear on your next bill, which will be in about... (pause) ...two weeks from now on April 15th. You should see both the credit applied and the lower rate reflected on that bill.

Customer: Okay, great. Thank you.

Agent: You're very welcome, Robert. I'm sorry we had to sort through all that today, but I'm glad we could get it taken care of. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's it. I'm good.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks so much for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
