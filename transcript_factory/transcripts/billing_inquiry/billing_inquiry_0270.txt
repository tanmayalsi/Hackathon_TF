Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually I do recognize it, but I think it's wrong.

Agent: Okay, I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get a name please?

Customer: It's James Patterson. P-A-T-T-E-R-S-O-N.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it, James. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Okay, I see you're on our Fiber 400 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right. Look, I've been with you guys for almost three years now, and my bill was always $79.99 a month. But this month it's $94.99. That's like fifteen dollars more out of nowhere. I didn't sign up for anything new.

Agent: I understand your frustration, James. Let me take a look at what happened here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history, and it looks like your promotional rate expired.

Customer: Promotional rate? I wasn't on some kind of deal. That was just the regular price.

Agent: I see where the confusion is coming from. When you first signed up three years ago, you were enrolled in a 36-month promotional offer for $79.99 a month. That promotion ended with your billing cycle last month.

Customer: Wait, nobody told me that was going to happen. I mean, I've got the paperwork somewhere, but... I don't remember signing up for something that was going to expire. That seems kind of shady, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. A lot of customers do express that same concern. The promotional terms are disclosed at signup, but I know that's sometimes easy to miss. Now, the good news is that I can definitely help you with options here.

Customer: Okay, like what?

Agent: (pause) Well, first of all, we do have some current promotions running for existing customers. I could potentially get you back on a promotional rate. We have our Fiber 300 plan for $69.99 for the first year, or I could... let me see here... (typing sounds) I could also offer you the same Fiber 400 plan you're on now for $84.99 a month for 12 months.

Customer: So you're telling me I have to sign up for another deal to get back to a reasonable price? Why should I do that? Why can't you just keep me at the original price?

Agent: (pause) That's a fair question, James. Unfortunately, once the promotional period ends, the regular rate goes into effect. But our promotions are designed specifically for situations like this—to keep our valued customers like yourself from seeing that sticker shock.

Customer: But what happens after the year is up? Do I get hit with another price jump?

Agent: That's a really good question. After the promotional period ends, yes, the regular rate would apply again. However, if you'd like, I can make a note on your account so that you're aware of that date, and we can work with you before it happens next time. Many customers like to either upgrade, downgrade, or renew a promotion before that kicks in.

Customer: (sighs) This seems like a frustrating system, Derek. I mean, honestly? I've been looking at switching to cable just because this feels like you guys are nickel-and-diming me.

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate your honesty. And I don't want to see you go—your fiber speeds are going to beat anything cable can offer in your area. But let me see what I can do for you here. (typing sounds) Can I put you on a brief hold while I check with my supervisor about what flexibility we might have?

Customer: Um, sure. I guess so.

Agent: Thank you. I'll be right back. (hold music plays, then fades) (pause) Okay, James, I'm back. So I spoke with my supervisor, and because you've been a customer for three years with good payment history, I can offer you the Fiber 400 at $84.99 for 24 months instead of 12. That locks in your rate for two years.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, that's a little better. But what if I need to cancel or move before two years?

Agent: Good question. You would have an early termination fee. Let me get you the exact amount. (typing sounds) It would be $120 if you cancel before the end of the 24-month term.

Customer: That's... reasonable, I guess. Okay, Derek, I'll do that. But I'm writing down the end date this time, and I'm calling you guys before it expires so I'm not in this situation again.

Agent: (slight laugh) That's perfect, actually. That's the smart way to do it. Alright, let me get this promotion set up for you. I'm going to need you to confirm that you want to switch to the Fiber 400 at $84.99 for 24 months, with a $120 early termination fee. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Great, and I'm going to make a note here for January 15th, 2026—that's when your promotional rate expires. I'll mark it so that when you call back, our team will have context. And I'm also going to add your email and phone number to a system reminder 30 days before expiration.

Customer: Okay, good. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Your new rate will appear on your next billing cycle, which should be [inaudible]... oh, looks like that's next Tuesday. You should see $84.99 on your next statement.

Customer: Great. Is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: Nope, that's all set. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour with all these details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this, Derek.

Agent: Absolutely, James. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and sorry again for that surprise on your bill. I hope you continue to enjoy your fiber service.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day!
