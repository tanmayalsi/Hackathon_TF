Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I just got my bill and... I'm pretty frustrated. My bill went up like twenty-five dollars from last month and nobody told me about any price increase.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I completely understand. Let me pull up your account here and take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... uh, my phone number is 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. And can I get a name to verify the account?

Customer: It's Sarah Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. Thanks for that. (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, I'm looking at your account here. I can see your most recent bill was $94.99, and the previous month was $69.99. So yes, there is a $25 increase. Let me look into what happened here...

Customer: Right, so what's the deal? I've been a customer for like three years and I've never had the bill jump like that. Did I get charged for something I didn't order?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me see... (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your service details. You have our Fiber 200 internet plan with our premium router rental, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's what I've had the whole time.

Agent: Right. So what I'm seeing here is that back on the 15th of last month, your promotional pricing period ended. You were on a promotional rate of $54.99 a month for the first twelve months, and that promotion has now expired. So your rate has gone to our standard pricing of $79.99 per month for the Fiber 200 service.

Customer: (pause) Wait, what? Nobody told me about this. I mean, I knew there was a promo rate, I guess, but I thought... I don't know, I thought I could keep that rate or that you guys would notify me or something.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Sarah. And you know, that's actually really valuable feedback. Let me check your account to see if we sent you any notifications about this... (typing sounds) It looks like we did send you an email notification about thirty days before the promotion ended. It would have been sent to the email address on file, which shows as [inaudible]... is that still a current email for you?

Customer: Well, I mean... I get a lot of emails. I might have missed it, but like, couldn't someone have called me or sent a text or something more obvious?

Agent: That's a fair point. I hear what you're saying. Unfortunately, email is our standard notification method, but I definitely understand that things can slip through the cracks. Let me see what I can do here to help make this right. (pause) (typing sounds) So... do you have any other options you're considering, or are you happy with your internet service otherwise?

Customer: No, the internet itself is great, honestly. The speeds are really good. I just... I don't like being surprised by bills going up, you know? It feels deceptive.

Agent: I totally get that. And I appreciate you sticking with us even with the rate increase. Let me see... (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to put a one-time credit on your account for the overage this month—that $25 difference—as a courtesy. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Well... that helps, but what about going forward? Like, am I just stuck at $79.99 now?

Agent: That's a great question. So the $79.99 is our standard pricing for that service level, but I do want to mention that we do have some other promotional offers available. Since you've been such a loyal customer for three years, I might be able to get you into a new promotion. It wouldn't be quite as low as your original promo rate, but we could probably get you down to around $64.99 for another twelve-month period. Let me just check what's available... (pause) (typing sounds) Yeah, I'm showing that I can apply that rate to your account right now if you'd like.

Customer: (pause) That's... okay, that's better. So that would be $64.99?

Agent: Yes, exactly. And that would lock in for another twelve months from today. After that, it would go back to the standard rate unless we have another promotion available at that time, but we could always discuss options when we get closer to that date.

Customer: Okay, and you're putting the credit on for this month, too?

Agent: Yes, I'm crediting the $25 difference from this month. So your next bill should reflect that credit, and then moving forward it'll be $64.99 per month for the next year.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate that, Derek. I'm still... I wish I had been notified better, but I feel a lot better about this now.

Agent: I really appreciate your patience, Sarah, and I'm glad we could work this out. Just to recap everything—I've applied a $25 credit to your account for this month, and I've activated a promotional rate of $64.99 per month for the next twelve months starting with your next billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, Sarah, and thank you for being a loyal customer. You have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
