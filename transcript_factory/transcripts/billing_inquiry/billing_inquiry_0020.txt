Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually, I recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it and it seems way too high.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's, um... (pause) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, just give me one second here. And can I have the name on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's Sarah Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. I'm pulling that up now. (pause) Alright, I've got you here. So you're saying there's a charge on your bill that you weren't expecting?

Customer: Right. So I've had the 300 megabit plan for like two years now, and my bill has always been $79.99. But this month it's suddenly $119.99. That's forty bucks more! I didn't authorize any plan changes or anything.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Sarah. Let me take a look at what happened here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate expired on the first of this month. You were on a promotional pricing that was set to expire, and now you've moved into our standard rate for that speed tier.

Customer: Wait, what? I never agreed to any promotional pricing. I just signed up and... I mean, I've been paying the same thing every month. How is that promotional?

Agent: I completely understand. So what typically happens is when customers sign up for service, the first year or sometimes the first two years are at a promotional rate, and then it adjusts to the standard rate after that introductory period ends. Let me check your account notes to see... (pause, typing) ...okay, so you signed up on March 15th of 2022, and the promotion was set to expire on March 15th of this year. This past March.

Customer: (sighs) Well, nobody told me about this. I mean, I never got a letter or anything. You'd think you guys would send a notification before you just jack up someone's bill like that.

Agent: You know, that's actually really fair feedback, and I apologize that you weren't made aware of this change. We do typically send out notices, but I can see here that there's a note that a notification was sent via email on March 1st.

Customer: I don't remember getting any email about this. My email gets really busy, so... (trails off) ...but still, shouldn't you guys call or something? Or at least put something on the bill the month before?

Agent: I hear you. That would definitely help prevent surprises like this. So here's what I can do for you. Because you've been such a loyal customer for two years, I can actually offer you a new promotional rate. We have a special going on right now for our existing customers where I can put you back on a promotional rate of $89.99 for the 300 megabit plan for the next 12 months. That way you'd be paying ten dollars more than you were before, but it's locked in for a full year.

Customer: (pause) So... it's still going to go up? It was $79.99 before.

Agent: Yes, unfortunately after this new 12-month promotional period, it would adjust again. But during that time you'd have the locked-in rate, and you could always call us before it expires to see if we have other options available. The other thing I could do is explore if there are any lower speed tiers that might work for you that would be less expensive overall.

Customer: Hmm. What would that be?

Agent: Well, we have our 200 megabit plan that's currently at $69.99 a month with a promotional rate. For most people doing regular internet use—email, streaming, social media—that speed is more than enough unless you have multiple people streaming 4K video at the same time.

Customer: I live alone, so I don't really need 300. But I do like watching Netflix and I work from home sometimes. Would 200 be okay for that?

Agent: For working from home and streaming, absolutely. 200 megabits is plenty. You'd have no issues there. So that would actually bring you down to $69.99, which is below what you were paying originally. And I could lock that in for 12 months as well.

Customer: (pause) Really? So it would actually be cheaper than what I was paying?

Agent: Yes, for the next year. After that promotional period, you'd move to standard rate, which I believe would be around $94.99 for that tier, but again, you could call back before it expires to see what we have available.

Customer: Okay, that actually sounds reasonable. So I'd be saving ten bucks a month right now. Can I just... like, if I downgrade and it turns out I need the faster speed, can I upgrade back?

Agent: Absolutely. You can change your plan at any time. If you do upgrade back to 300 within the promotional period, we'd have to apply a new promotion to that plan as well, but I'd definitely make a note on your account so when you call back, our team can take care of you. There wouldn't be any fees for switching.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, let's do that. Let's switch to the 200 plan.

Agent: Perfect. Let me process that for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm changing your plan from the 300 megabit tier to the 200 megabit tier, and I'm applying the promotional rate of $69.99 for 12 months starting immediately. This change will take effect on your next billing cycle, which would be... (pause) ...November 15th. So you'll see this new rate reflected on your November bill.

Customer: Great. And can you make a note about this so I don't get surprised again?

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely, I'm putting a note right here that says "Customer downgraded due to price increase. Discussed promo expiration on November 15th, 2024—customer should call before expiration to discuss options." So whenever you call back, our team will see that.

Customer: Thank you. I appreciate that.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... that's everything. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your loyalty. If you have any issues with your service or if you need anything else, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Okay, will do. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Thank you for calling Frontier!
