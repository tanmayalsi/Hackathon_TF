# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize, and my bill is also just... it's way higher than it should be.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And just to confirm, is this for the account under the name Michael Torres?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. I'm looking at your account now. I can see you're on our Fiber 300 plan. Is that right?

Customer: Yes, that's correct. But here's the thing—I've had that plan for like, two years, and my bill was always $89.99 a month. This month it's $127. That's almost forty dollars more. I didn't add any services or anything.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me see what's going on here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional pricing expired. It looks like you had a two-year promotional rate of $89.99, and that ended with your last billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me that was going to happen. I mean, I've been a customer for how long now?

Agent: Let me check your account history here... It looks like you've been with us for two years and three months total.

Customer: Right, so I've been a good customer. I paid my bill on time every month. Why am I just now finding out about this price increase? And why is there another charge on here for $38.99? What is that for?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so that $38.99 charge... let me look at the details. (pause) That appears to be for a service call. Can you tell me if someone came out to your house recently?

Customer: No, nobody came out. I haven't had any service issues. That's... that shouldn't be on my bill at all.

Agent: Okay, I appreciate you letting me know that. I'm going to make a note on your account. That does look like it may be an error. But first, let me address the rate increase. When you initially signed up, did you receive any information about the promotional period ending?

Customer: (pause) I mean... maybe? I don't know. I get a lot of mail from you guys. I just assumed the price would stay the same since, you know, I never had a contract or anything. I'm on a month-to-month basis.

Agent: I understand. So the promotional rate of $89.99 was for a 24-month period, and after that, the rate adjusts to our standard rate. Your area's standard rate for Fiber 300 is $127.99 per month. I can see that you were sent notifications about this. There should have been a notice in your bills about 60 days before the expiration and again at 30 days.

Customer: Well, I don't remember seeing anything, but okay. That's frustrating, but I guess I get it. But what about that $38.99 charge? I absolutely did not authorize a service call.

Agent: Right, let me investigate that for you. (typing sounds) Can I put you on a brief hold while I check with our service department to see what that charge is for?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

Agent: Thank you, I'll just be a moment.

(hold music plays, approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Michael? Thanks for holding.

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Okay, so I spoke with our service team, and there's no record of a service call being dispatched to your address during this billing period. So it does look like that charge was applied in error. I'm going to go ahead and remove that $38.99 from your account right now.

Customer: Oh, okay. Thank you. I appreciate that.

Agent: You're welcome. So regarding the rate increase—I know it's a big jump, and I understand that's frustrating. Unfortunately, that is our standard rate for that service tier. However, I do have a couple of options for you. I can offer you a promotional rate if you'd like to lock in a contract. We have a 12-month agreement available at $99.99 per month for Fiber 300, which would be a savings of $28 per month compared to our standard month-to-month rate.

Customer: Hmm. So I'd have to sign a contract?

Agent: Yes, it would be a 12-month agreement. After that period ends, the rate would adjust again unless we have another promotion available.

Customer: (pause) I don't know. I'm not really thrilled about locking into a contract. Can I think about it?

Agent: Absolutely, take your time. And you know what—even though I can't force a rate change without you committing to the contract, let me put a note on your account. Sometimes our retention team has additional options, and they can reach out to you. Would that be okay?

Customer: Yeah, sure, that's fine.

Agent: Great. So to recap—I've removed that erroneous $38.99 service charge from your account. Your new balance is $127.99 for your Fiber 300 service. You should see that credit reflected on your next bill or within 2-3 business days if you check your account online. I've also added a note for our retention team about discussing additional options with you.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. And you said I'd get a credit on the next bill?

Agent: Yes, the $38.99 credit will appear on your next statement.

Customer: Alright. And just to be clear—the $127.99 is the new regular price now?

Agent: That's correct, unless you decide to go with the 12-month promotional rate of $99.99 that I mentioned. Just give us a call back if you'd like to do that, or our retention team may reach out to you as well.

Customer: Okay. Well, I appreciate you helping me figure this out.

Agent: My pleasure, Michael. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Great. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and we really appreciate your business. You have a great day.

Customer: Thanks, you too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
