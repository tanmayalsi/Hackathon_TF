Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my internet price went up like thirty bucks a month. I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the phone number. Actually, it's also my internet service address.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Got it. I see your account. Can I verify the address for you? Is that 4821 Maple Street, Portland?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned two things—a charge you don't recognize and a price increase. Let me look at your current bill here. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your monthly service charge did increase. Can you tell me what price you were paying before?

Customer: I was paying 79.99 for the gig internet plan, and now it's showing 109.99. That's like... that's a forty dollar increase, actually. And then there's this other charge for like 14.99 that just says "equipment rental" but I own my modem. I bought it three years ago.

Agent: Okay, so two issues here. Let me address those. First, regarding the price increase—do you happen to have your promotional period end date? Many of our customers are on an introductory rate for the first twelve months.

Customer: Promotional period? Nobody told me anything about a promotional period.

Agent: I apologize for any confusion there. Let me check your account history. (typing sounds, pause) I'm seeing here that you were enrolled in our Gigabit Promo Rate back in January of last year. That was a twelve-month promotional offer at $79.99 per month. That promotion actually expired about two weeks ago, which is why your rate adjusted to our standard rate of $109.99.

Customer: Wait, wait. So you're telling me you just automatically jacked up my price without even sending me a notice or anything?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. We do send notifications typically sixty days before a promotion expires. Let me see if I can find the details of what was sent... (pause) I'm showing a notification was sent to your email on file on November 15th. Do you have that email address still active?

Customer: (pause) I mean... I probably have that email, but I get like a hundred emails a day. But still, shouldn't you guys have called me or something?

Agent: That's fair feedback, and I appreciate that. Unfortunately, email is our standard notification method, but I definitely understand that things can slip through. Now, let me address the equipment rental charge. You mentioned you own your modem?

Customer: Yeah, I bought a Netgear modem back in 2021. I'm not renting anything from you guys.

Agent: Okay, and do you also have a router, or are you using the modem in router mode?

Customer: I have... I think just the modem. Why?

Agent: I'm asking because this charge might be for our WiFi gateway device. Let me check your equipment list here. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm actually showing in our system that we're charging you for a gateway rental, but it looks like that was added to your account about six months ago and never should have been there if you were providing your own equipment. That's our error.

Customer: So you've been charging me for something I'm not even using?

Agent: It appears that way, and I sincerely apologize for that. What I can do right now is remove that charge immediately, and I'm also going to credit your account for the last six months of those charges. That would be approximately $89.94.

Customer: Okay, well, that's good, but what about the price increase? I don't want to pay a hundred and ten dollars a month. That's ridiculous.

Agent: (pause) I understand that's a significant jump from what you were paying. Let me see what options I have available to you. One moment, please. (pause, typing sounds)

Customer: Okay.

Agent: So, I have a few options. I can offer you our Gigabit Promo Rate again, which would be $89.99 per month instead of the $109.99, but that would be for a twelve-month term starting today.

Customer: So it's still ten dollars more than what I was paying.

Agent: Yes, sir, that's correct. The promotional rates have adjusted slightly since your initial promotion. However, I'm also not seeing any other service providers in your area currently, is that right?

Customer: (sighs) I mean, I looked into it. There's cable, but honestly, your internet is way more reliable, and I've been happy with the service itself.

Agent: I appreciate you saying that. So would the $89.99 promotional rate for twelve months work for you, given the circumstances?

Customer: And you're crediting me the ninety dollars for the equipment rental thing, right?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. That $89.94 credit will be applied to your next billing cycle.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I'll take the promotion. But I'm telling you guys, you need to do a better job notifying people about this stuff.

Agent: I completely hear you, and I'm going to make a note on your account about your feedback regarding our notification process. That's important information for our team to know. So let me confirm everything for you. I'm removing the equipment rental charge, crediting six months of that charge at $89.94, and enrolling you in our Gigabit Promo Rate at $89.99 per month for twelve months starting with your next billing cycle.

Customer: That sounds right.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm processing that now. You should see those changes reflected in your next bill, which would be due on the 15th of next month. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thank you for fixing all that.

Agent: You're very welcome, and again, I apologize for the confusion with the promotional period and that erroneous charge. We really do appreciate your business. Is there a phone number where we can reach you if we have any questions?

Customer: The number you have on file is fine.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for calling Frontier, and have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
