Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Or actually, I do recognize it, but I wasn't told about it, and I'm pretty upset about it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my home phone number too.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. One moment... Alright, I've got your account. I see you're in the Portland area, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned there's a charge you're not familiar with. Can you tell me what it is or approximately how much it is?

Customer: Well, that's the thing. My bill went from $89 a month to $119 a month. That's a thirty-dollar increase! And nobody called me or emailed me or anything to let me know this was happening. I've been a customer for what, seven years now? And this is how you treat loyal customers?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I appreciate your loyalty. Let me take a look at what changed on your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that your promotional rate expired at the end of last month. You were on a two-year promotion for $89.99, and that ended on... December 31st. Is that right?

Customer: (pause) Well... I mean, I guess I knew something like that might happen eventually, but when did I sign up for that? It's been so long, I don't even remember. And shouldn't you guys send me a reminder or something before you just jack up the price?

Agent: That's a really fair point. We should have sent you a notification. Let me check your contact preferences... (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like we did send an email notification on December 15th about the rate change. Did you happen to see that?

Customer: I get like a hundred emails a day. How am I supposed to know which ones are from you guys? Why can't you call people?

Agent: You know, that's actually a great suggestion. I'm sorry we didn't reach out by phone. Unfortunately, we typically send email notifications, but I understand that's not always... the most effective way to reach everyone. (pause) That said, um, let me see what options I have here to help you out. What package are you currently on?

Customer: I'm not sure. The basic one? I have the 100 megabit plan with phone service.

Agent: Okay, perfect. So the 100 meg internet plan is now $99.99 after the promotion, and then phone service is an additional $19.99. So your new total is $119.98. Is that matching what you're seeing on your bill?

Customer: Yeah, pretty much. So what am I supposed to do? Just eat the thirty-dollar increase? Because honestly, I've been looking at some other providers, and I could probably get similar speeds with someone else for less.

Agent: (pause) Well, I definitely don't want to lose you as a customer. Let me see what I can do here. Give me just one second... (typing sounds) Okay, so we do have some promotional options available for existing customers. I can offer you a one-year extension on a promotional rate of $104.99 for the internet and phone bundle. That would save you about fifteen dollars a month compared to the regular rate.

Customer: Fifteen dollars? What about the full thirty dollars? I was paying $89 for two years.

Agent: I understand. Unfortunately, that original promotion was a limited-time offer that expired. However, I can't extend it at that exact rate. But the $104.99 rate is... it's a pretty significant discount from the $119.98 regular rate, and it would be locked in for a full year, which means you won't see any surprises next year—at least not for twelve months.

Customer: (sighs) So basically you're saying I have to pay more, and this is the best you can do?

Agent: I know it's frustrating. Let me be honest with you—this is actually the best offer I can extend to existing customers in your area right now. And I want to be transparent: if you were to shop around with other providers, they might have introductory rates that look better, but they often come with contracts or installation fees. We wouldn't charge you an installation fee for keeping your service active.

Customer: (pause) ...I don't know. Let me think about it. Can you tell me what happens if I don't accept this? Does my rate just stay at $119?

Agent: Yes, if you don't accept the promotional offer, your rate would remain at $119.98 per month. However, I do need to let you know that this offer is valid through today only. If you'd like to take advantage of it, I can apply it right now.

Customer: That's pretty pushy.

Agent: I'm not trying to be pushy at all. I'm just letting you know the terms. If you need more time to think about it, you can definitely call us back, but I can't guarantee that this specific rate will still be available. That said, whatever you decide, I'm here to help.

Customer: (long pause) Okay, okay. You know what? I'll take it. $104.99. But I'm not happy about this. And next time, please call me or something to give me a heads up before my rate changes.

Agent: Thank you so much for sticking with us. I really appreciate it. I'm going to make a note on your account right now requesting that we reach out by phone for your next rate change notification. (typing sounds) Alright, I'm applying the promotional rate now. Your new billing cycle starts on January 15th, and your first bill at the new rate will be $104.99. You should see that reflected by then.

Customer: Okay. And how long is this rate good for?

Agent: This is locked in for twelve months, so through December 31st of this year. After that, your rate would revert to the standard rate unless another promotion becomes available. We'll definitely reach out to you before that happens.

Customer: Alright. I hope so.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, I guess.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and thanks for being a customer with us.

Customer: Yep. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day. Bye now.
