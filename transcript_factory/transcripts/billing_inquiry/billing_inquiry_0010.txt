Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um... I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, I'm pretty frustrated about it.

Agent: I completely understand. I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account real quick so I can take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it right here. I'm seeing an account under the name... is this David Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, David. So you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize. Can you tell me which charge is giving you trouble, or... do you see multiple charges that are unexpected?

Customer: Well, it's more like... my bill went up. Like, significantly. I mean, I've been paying $79.99 a month for the past couple years, and this month it's showing $119.99. That's a forty-dollar increase with basically no warning. I didn't authorize any changes or upgrades or anything.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I see that. Let me take a look at your account history here... (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm looking at your account, and I can see that you've been on our Fiber 200 plan at $79.99 per month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one I've had.

Agent: And looking at your recent activity, it looks like... okay, so your promotional pricing expired at the end of last month. Your account was on a promotional rate for the first year, and that period has now ended. So you're transitioning to our standard rate for that speed tier, which is $119.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, hold on. Nobody told me about this. If there was a promotion, shouldn't I have gotten some kind of notice? Like, an email or something?

Agent: That's a really good question. Let me check your account notes here. (typing sounds) So typically, we do send out notices before promotional rates expire. It looks like we sent a notice... (pause) it was sent via email to the address we have on file about thirty days before the rate change. Did you... did you happen to see that, or...?

Customer: I mean, I might have gotten an email, but you know how it is. You get so many emails. I didn't realize it was about a price increase. If I'd known, I would've... I don't know, I would've called or looked into other options or something. Forty bucks is a lot of money per month.

Agent: I totally get that, David. That's a significant jump. (pause) So let me see what I can do here to help you out. Can you just give me a moment? I'm going to check what promotional offers we might have available for you right now.

Customer: Okay, sure. How long is this gonna take? I'm kind of in the middle of... nevermind, go ahead.

Agent: (typing sounds, pause) Alright, so I'm looking at our current promotions, and I do have a couple of options for you. The good news is, since you've been such a loyal customer for a couple of years, I can offer you a retention rate. I can get you back down to $89.99 per month for the next twelve months. That's still higher than your original promotional rate, but it's better than the full $119.99.

Customer: So that's still a ten-dollar increase from what I was paying before.

Agent: I understand, and you're absolutely right. The original promotional period has ended, so I can't bring it back to exactly $79.99, but this is the best rate I can offer you at the moment. After the twelve months, if you still want to stay with us, we can look at your options again at that time.

Customer: Hmm... (pause) What about if I switched to a slower speed? Like, what's the next tier down from the 200 plan?

Agent: Great question. We have our Fiber 100 plan, which would be $69.99 per month on the standard rate. So that would actually be lower than what you're paying now—even lower than your original promotional rate.

Customer: But I'd be getting slower internet?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. You'd have 100 megabits per second download instead of 200. Depending on what you use your internet for, it might be perfectly adequate. Like, if you're just browsing, streaming, you know, email—most people don't really notice a difference in their day-to-day activities.

Customer: I mean, I work from home sometimes, so I do video calls and... stuff. Would that be a problem?

Agent: Video calls should work totally fine on the 100 plan. It's really video streaming and downloading large files where you might notice a slight difference, but for most applications, it's solid. (pause) But if you want to stick with the 200 speed, I'd really recommend taking that $89.99 rate I mentioned. It's a good middle ground.

Customer: (long pause) ...Okay. Can you just... can you put me on that plan? The $89.99 for twelve months?

Agent: Absolutely, David. I'm going to make that change for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, and... perfect. So your new rate is now locked in at $89.99 per month for the next twelve months. You should see that reflected on your next billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on that.

Agent: Of course, I'm glad I could help. And hey, I'm sorry again about the confusion with the promotional rate expiring. Going forward, if you have any questions about your bill or your service, just give us a call back. We're here to help.

Customer: Will do. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier, David. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
