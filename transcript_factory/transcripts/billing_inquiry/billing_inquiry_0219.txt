Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I don't know, something doesn't look right. My internet bill went up like forty bucks, and nobody told me anything about that.

Agent: I understand your concern. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my cell phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. And can I get your name please?

Customer: It's Michael. Michael Rothstein.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I can see that your most recent bill was... $129.99. Is that the one you're concerned about?

Customer: Yes, exactly. Last month it was like... I want to say 89 or 90 dollars? And this month it's almost 130. I didn't add anything to my plan. I didn't call and upgrade or anything.

Agent: I totally understand where you're coming from. Let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that you were on our promotional rate for the first twelve months. That promotion ended last month, so your rate adjusted to our standard rate for the Frontier Fiber 500 plan.

Customer: Wait, what? I... nobody said anything about a promotion ending. I signed up for this plan over a year ago. Why would they make it promotional and not tell me?

Agent: Well, typically when customers sign up, the promotional terms are outlined in the initial agreement. But I completely understand that it can be frustrating when that changes. Um, I'm looking at your paperwork here, and it does show a twelve-month promotional period that started... (pause) ...back in October of last year.

Customer: This is ridiculous. I mean, I chose Frontier specifically because of the price, and now you're just... jacking it up? What am I supposed to do?

Agent: I hear you, Michael. And I really appreciate your business. Let me see what options I have for you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I do have the ability to apply a one-time credit to your account for this month to help offset that increase. And, um... (hesitates) ...I can also look into what other plans might be available to you that could potentially bring that cost down a bit.

Customer: A one-time credit? So next month it's still going to be 130 bucks?

Agent: Well, that's a good question. Yes, without any plan changes, your standard rate would remain at that level going forward. However, I can certainly explore some other options with you. We do have some packages available, and depending on what you need, there might be something that works better for your budget.

Customer: Okay, um... what kind of options? Like, do I have to downgrade my speed or something?

Agent: That's a possibility, yes. So you're currently on our Fiber 500 plan at $129.99. We also have a Fiber 200 plan that would be $79.99 per month, and then we have Fiber 100 at $59.99. Those would get you back closer to what you were paying before.

Customer: (pause) I mean, I use the internet a lot. I work from home, and I stream and everything. I don't know if 200 would be enough. Can I think about that?

Agent: Absolutely. You don't have to decide right now. Um, what I can do is apply that one-time credit to bring this bill down, and then you can think about whether you want to make any changes to your plan. And honestly, Michael, if you're interested, I could also put a note on your account to see if there's any loyalty offers I can provide. Sometimes we do have options for customers who've been with us for a while.

Customer: A loyalty offer? Like what?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check... (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing anything specifically available at this moment, but what I can do is put that note on there, and you could call back in a few days, and whoever takes that call can look at what current promotions we might have. Sometimes things change pretty regularly on our end.

Customer: Okay, so... (trailing off) ...so right now, what's the best you can offer me?

Agent: Right now, the best I can do is apply a $40 credit to this month's bill to bring it down to about $90, which would match what you were paying before. That would at least get you through this billing cycle without a big hit. And then I'd encourage you to either think about switching to a lower speed plan, or give us another call to see if there's any new promotions available. Does that sound fair?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess. I mean, that helps for this month, but I'm still frustrated about all this.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry for the frustration. I know it's not ideal. But I do want to make sure we find a solution that works for you long-term. Is there anything else I can help with today?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. I just appreciate the credit, at least.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to apply that credit right now. (typing sounds) Okay, it's all set. You should see that reflected on your next bill. And just to confirm, your account number is 555-0847, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. Well, thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, Michael. And again, don't hesitate to reach back out if you have any other questions or if you'd like to discuss those plan options further.

Customer: Okay, thanks Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
