# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement that came in the mail, and I'm seeing a charge that I definitely don't recognize.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's the number the service is on.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. I'm pulling up your account here... And your name is?

Customer: It's Jennifer Walsh.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. I see your account here. So you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize. Can you tell me which charge you're referring to?

Customer: Yeah, so... on this month's bill, there's a line item for "Equipment Fee - Premium Router" for $14.99. I've never seen this before, and I don't remember authorizing anything like that.

Agent: I understand. Let me take a look at your account details here. (pause, typing) Okay, I'm seeing that. Can you tell me when you first noticed this charge? Was it this month only, or has it been showing up for a while?

Customer: No, just this month. My bill went from like $89.99 to $104.98, so I definitely noticed the jump. That's almost fifteen bucks out of nowhere, you know?

Agent: Yeah, that would definitely catch someone's attention. Let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) So I'm looking at your service history, and it looks like your account was recently upgraded. It says here that on the 15th of last month, your plan was upgraded from our standard 200 megabit service to our Gigabit Fiber Plus package.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't upgrade anything. I don't remember calling and asking for an upgrade.

Agent: I understand that's confusing. Let me pull up more details here. (pause) Okay, so according to the notes in the system, you were contacted by one of our retention specialists when your promotional rate was expiring. Does that sound familiar at all?

Customer: Oh... maybe? I get a lot of calls. But I definitely didn't agree to any upgrade. All I do is watch Netflix and do some work emails. I don't need gigabit speeds or whatever.

Agent: I completely understand. So here's what might have happened—when the promotional period ended on your 200 megabit plan, the rate would have gone up to $94.99 per month anyway. The Gigabit Fiber Plus plan is $109.99 per month, which would include that $14.99 equipment fee for the premium router that we'd send to you.

Customer: So... wait, so they upgraded me without me really agreeing to it?

Agent: Let me check the call notes here. (typing) So it looks like there was a call on the 15th that lasted about four minutes. The agent noted that they explained the upgrade offer, and it says "customer approved." But I can absolutely understand your frustration if you didn't feel like you clearly agreed to that.

Customer: I mean, yeah, I'm frustrated. I don't remember agreeing to anything, and even if I did, I definitely didn't understand that I was being switched to a different plan. I thought they were just calling about my rate going up.

Agent: (pause) You know what, Jennifer, I really appreciate you bringing this to our attention, and I want to make this right. Here's what I can do for you. First, I can immediately reverse that equipment charge for this month—the $14.99. That'll bring your bill back down.

Customer: Okay, that's good, but what about the whole plan thing? I don't want the gigabit service. Can I go back to my old plan?

Agent: Absolutely, yes. I can definitely downgrade you back to the 200 megabit plan. However, I do need to let you know that your promotional rate has expired, so the rate on that plan would be $94.99 per month, instead of the $89.99 you were paying before.

Customer: (sighs) So my bill's going up no matter what?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. The promotional period on your account ended, so we wouldn't be able to extend that rate. But I'll tell you what—let me see if I can offer you a different promotional rate to make up for this. (typing) Give me just one second here... Okay, I'm able to put you on a six-month promotional rate of $79.99 per month on the 200 megabit plan as a gesture of goodwill for the confusion with the upgrade.

Customer: (pause) Really? That's actually... that's better than what I was paying before.

Agent: Yeah, it should help make up for the frustration here. And just to be clear, that's locked in for six months, and then after that, it would go to the regular rate of $94.99 unless we have another promotion available at that time.

Customer: Yeah, okay. That sounds fair. So what exactly are you going to do right now?

Agent: So here's what I'm going to process: First, I'm removing the $14.99 equipment fee charge from this month's bill. Second, I'm downgrading your service back to the 200 megabit Fiber plan. And third, I'm applying the six-month promotional rate of $79.99 per month, effective immediately. So your next bill should reflect all of those changes.

Customer: Okay, great. And I won't be getting that premium router sent to me, right?

Agent: Correct. Since we're reversing the equipment charge, we won't be sending that equipment out. If for some reason one does arrive, just let us know and we can arrange a return.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks for taking care of that.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you fixing that.

Agent: My pleasure, Jennifer. And again, I apologize for the confusion with the upgrade. We'll make sure to note your account here so there's a clear record of this. You should see those changes reflected on your next bill, which should arrive within the next week or so. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and please don't hesitate to call back if you have any other questions.

Customer: Thanks, I will. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, Jennifer. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
