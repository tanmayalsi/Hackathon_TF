Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I'm really frustrated with my bill. I was just looking at my statement and something doesn't add up.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to help you figure this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. The account is under Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Jennifer, I'm pulling up your account now. One moment please... Alright, I've got you here. You're on our Fiber 500 plan with us since... 2019. Great. So what seems to be the issue with your bill?

Customer: Well, I got my statement yesterday, and my bill went up. Like, significantly. I was paying $79.99 a month for the last... I don't know, three or four years? And now this month it's $119.99. That's a $40 increase! I didn't authorize any changes, and nobody called me to tell me about this.

Agent: I understand, that is quite a jump. Let me look into that for you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate expired at the end of last month. You were on a three-year promotion that locked in your rate at $79.99, and that ended with your April billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, what? A promotional rate? I wasn't aware of that. I mean, I've had this service for years. Why would I have been on a promo the whole time?

Agent: That's a great question. When you first signed up in 2019, you were enrolled in our three-year promotional offer. That would have covered you through April of this year. After that period ends, the rate goes to our standard pricing, which for the Fiber 500 plan is $119.99 per month.

Customer: Okay, but... didn't anyone notify me about this? I feel like I should've gotten a letter or a phone call or something. This is kind of a surprise.

Agent: That's very fair feedback. (pause) Let me check your account here... I'm seeing that a notification was sent to the email address on file back in March. It looks like it was sent to jennifer.martinez1976@... um, is that a current email address for you?

Customer: That one? I don't really check that email very often. I primarily use a different one. But I mean, that's not really the point. The point is, I've been a loyal customer for years, and my rate just jumped $40. Can you help me with this?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Jennifer. You're absolutely right that $40 is a significant increase. Let me see what options I have for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so typically after a promotional period expires, I can look at what current offers we have available. 

Customer: I mean... is this standard? Do all your customers go through this?

Agent: That's... that's a good question. So our promotional rates are designed to attract new customers, and after a period of time, the rate adjusts to standard pricing. That's pretty industry standard across most providers, but I get that it's frustrating when you've been with us for a long time.

Customer: Hmm.

Agent: So, here's what I can do. I can apply a loyalty discount to your account. We have a current retention offer that would bring your rate down to $99.99 per month for the next 12 months. That's still higher than what you were paying, but it's a middle ground.

Customer: $99.99? So I'd be paying $20 more than I was before. That's still a pretty big jump.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, that's the best offer I have available in the system right now for your specific plan and area. However, I could also look at some of our other plan options. We have a Fiber 300 plan that runs $89.99 with your promotional rate—

Customer: Wait, but I have Fiber 500. I specifically chose that because I work from home and I need the faster speeds. I can't downgrade.

Agent: (pause) Right, of course. I understand. Okay, so let me look into this a bit more. Give me just one second. (pause, typing sounds) You know what, let me get my supervisor to review your account. You've been with us for a long time, and I want to make sure we're giving you the best option available. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, okay. How long is this going to take?

Agent: Should be just a few minutes. I'll be right back with you.

Customer: Alright.

(hold music plays, then stops)

Agent: Jennifer? Thank you for holding. I've reviewed a few other options with my supervisor. So, I'm able to offer you the Fiber 500 plan at $104.99 per month for the next 24 months. That's a discount of $15 off the standard rate, and it's actually a better rate than the 12-month offer I mentioned before.

Customer: (pause) Okay... so that's still $25 more than what I was paying before.

Agent: I know it's not ideal, but unfortunately, the promotional pricing can't be extended. What I can say is that this locks in your rate for two years, so you won't see any unexpected increases during that time. And honestly, this is one of the better retention offers I'm able to put on the account.

Customer: Can you... is there any way you could credit my account for this month? Like, could you just charge me the old rate for May since I didn't know about this increase?

Agent: (pause) Let me see if I can do that. (typing sounds) You know, I can apply a one-time account credit of $40 to cover the difference for this month. How's that?

Customer: (pause) Really? Okay, yes. I appreciate that. And the $104.99 rate for two years... that's locked in?

Agent: That's correct. That rate is locked in for 24 months, and it applies starting next month with your June bill. The credit will show up on your May bill, so you'll only pay $79.99 this month.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, I mean... I'm still not thrilled about the increase overall, but I appreciate you working with me on this. I just wish I'd been more aware of it beforehand.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize that the notification didn't reach you in a way that was convenient. If you'd like, I can update your contact information so future notifications go to the email you use most often. That way you won't miss anything like this in the future.

Customer: Actually, yeah. That would be helpful. It's jennifer.m.martinez@gmail.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've updated that for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. I really appreciate your patience and loyalty with Frontier. If you need anything else in the future, don't hesitate to give us a call. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
