Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I received my bill this morning and I noticed there's a significant charge that I don't recognize, and honestly, my monthly rate seems to have gone up quite a bit.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm looking at your account for... Sarah Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great, Sarah. I can see your account here. So you mentioned you have a charge you don't recognize and a rate increase. Let me take a look at your most recent bill. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your statement from this month. Can you tell me which charge is concerning you?

Customer: Well, first of all, my internet was supposed to be $79.99 a month, and now it says $94.99. That's a fifteen dollar increase! I haven't changed my service or anything. And then there's this other charge here for... it looks like $39.99, and I have no idea what that is.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Sarah. Let me explain what I'm seeing here. (typing sounds) So the $39.99 charge—let me check the description—that appears to be a modem rental fee.

Customer: A modem rental fee? But I own my modem. I bought it myself about two years ago. Why would I be charged for renting a modem that I own?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me look into that for you. (pause) Okay, so it looks like when your service was last updated in our system, there may have been a notation error. It's showing that you're renting equipment from us when, based on what you're saying, you have your own modem. That's definitely something we can correct.

Customer: Okay, well, that needs to be fixed. And what about the rate increase?

Agent: Right, yes. So regarding the rate increase from $79.99 to $94.99—I want to be transparent with you here. We did have a service adjustment in your area. However... (pause) let me see what promotional pricing you might qualify for. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your history. You've been with us for about three years now, and I can see you were on a promotional rate that expired last month.

Customer: Oh, so you're just letting the promotional rate expire without telling me? That seems deceptive. I didn't get any notice about this.

Agent: I completely understand why you'd feel that way. Let me check to see if we sent out a notification. (pause) It looks like a notice was sent to the email address we have on file about thirty days prior to the rate change. Did you receive anything like that?

Customer: I... I don't know. Maybe? I get a lot of emails. But the thing is, I've been a loyal customer for three years. Don't I get some kind of loyalty discount or something?

Agent: That's... that's a fair point, Sarah, and I appreciate your loyalty. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I do have the ability to apply a loyalty retention offer. I can bring your rate back down to $84.99 per month for the next twelve months. That would be a ten dollar reduction from the current rate, so it's $10 less than what's being charged right now.

Customer: So instead of paying $94.99, I'd pay $84.99?

Agent: Correct. That would be for the next twelve months, and then after that, it would be subject to our standard pricing, but at least it gets you a better rate in the interim. Plus, we'll absolutely remove that modem rental charge since you have your own equipment.

Customer: (pause) Okay, well... that's better than what I'm paying now, but it's still five dollars more than what I was originally paying.

Agent: I hear what you're saying. Let me see if there's anything else I can do. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I can also waive your next month's service charge entirely as a one-time courtesy for the billing error with the modem rental and the inconvenience of the rate change notification. So you'd get one month of service free.

Customer: (pause) Alright, that does help. So to confirm—you're removing the $39.99 modem charge from this bill, applying the loyalty rate of $84.99 a month going forward, and waiving next month's charges?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. So your current bill will be adjusted. We'll remove that $39.99 charge immediately. Your new monthly rate will be $84.99 starting next month, and then the month after that will be at no charge. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, I guess so. I'm still not thrilled about the rate increase overall, but I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: I really do appreciate your patience and your loyalty, Sarah. And I'm sorry for the frustration with the billing error. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Just... maybe work on notifying customers better about rate changes?

Agent: (chuckles) I hear you. I'll make a note of that feedback on your account. We'll definitely take that into consideration. Your new billing adjustments should be reflected on your account within 24 hours. You'll receive a corrected bill in your email. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome, Sarah. Thanks for choosing Frontier Communications, and thank you for being a valued customer. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
