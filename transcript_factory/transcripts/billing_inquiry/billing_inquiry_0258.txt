Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm pretty upset about it. My internet bill went up like thirty dollars a month, and nobody told me this was going to happen.

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. I'm really sorry you're experiencing an unexpected increase. Let me pull up your account so I can take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. My name is David Chen, by the way.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, David. Thank you. Let me just... okay, I'm looking at your account here. I see your service at 425 Maple Street in Springfield. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that your bill from the previous cycle was $79.99, and your current bill is $109.99. So you're right, that is about a thirty-dollar increase. Let me look into what caused that. (typing sounds) 

Okay, I see what happened here. It looks like you were on a promotional rate for the first twelve months of your service. That promotional period ended last month, and your rate has adjusted to our standard pricing for our 400 Mbps Fiber Internet plan.

Customer: Wait, what? I was never told about this. I mean, when I signed up, nobody mentioned that the price would jump up after a year. This is ridiculous.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, David. And I apologize that the promotional terms weren't made clearer at the time of signup. Unfortunately, these promotional rates do have an end date. However, let me see what options I can look into for you. (pause) 

Do you remember if you received any notification letters or emails about this rate adjustment? Sometimes we do send those out about thirty to sixty days before the change takes effect.

Customer: (sighs) I mean, I get a lot of mail. I might have gotten something, but I definitely don't remember seeing anything about the price going up this much. And I don't really check my email that often. The point is, I'm paying way more now and I didn't agree to it.

Agent: I hear you. That's fair. Let me see what I can do here to help make this right. (typing sounds) What I'm going to do is check our current promotional offerings. 

David, are you interested in perhaps extending a promotional rate, or would you like me to look at some different plan options that might save you money? We do have some great deals available right now.

Customer: I don't know... I mean, I like the internet service itself. The speed is good. I just don't want to pay a hundred and ten bucks a month for it. That's insane. How much would one of these other plans cost?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so right now we have a couple of options. We have our 200 Mbps Fiber Internet plan at $59.99 per month for the first twelve months with a two-year agreement. Or, we can lock you into our 400 Mbps plan that you're currently on—which is what you have now—at $89.99 for twelve months. Both of these are promotional prices.

Customer: Okay, so with the 400 Mbps plan, I'd be paying $89.99 instead of $109.99?

Agent: That's correct. And that would be locked in for twelve months from today. After that promotional period expires, it would adjust to the standard rate again, which I want to be transparent about.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, but at least I'd save some money now. And then I'd have a year to figure out what I want to do. Can you do that for me?

Agent: Absolutely, David. I can definitely apply that promotional rate to your account. What I'll do is set up a new twelve-month promotional period at $89.99 per month for your 400 Mbps Fiber Internet service. This will take effect on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Great. And when would that be?

Agent: (typing sounds) Your next billing cycle begins on the 15th of next month, so you should see this new rate reflected on your bill at that time. You'll save about twenty dollars per month compared to what you're paying now.

Customer: Okay, that's good. But what about my current bill? The $109.99 one? Am I still going to owe that?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me look into that for you. (pause) Okay, since we're adjusting your rate, I can actually issue a courtesy credit for the overage to your account. So that's the difference between what you were charged and what the promotional rate would have been. That would be about twenty dollars.

Customer: So I'm getting a credit?

Agent: Yes, a credit of approximately twenty dollars will be applied to your account, which should show up within two to three business days.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that helps. I appreciate that. So just to make sure I understand—I'm getting the credit, my rate drops to $89.99 next month, and then we're doing this for twelve months?

Agent: Exactly. You've got it. And David, I do want to mention—when you get close to the end of this promotional period, I'd recommend giving us a call or checking your account online so you can proactively explore your options rather than facing another surprise rate increase. We may have new promotions available at that time as well.

Customer: Yeah, I'll definitely do that. Lesson learned. (pause) Is there anything else I need to do on my end?

Agent: No, you shouldn't need to do anything. The changes will all be processed on our end. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly, and then you'll see the updated bill on the 15th of next month.

Customer: All right. Great. Thank you for helping me out, Marcus. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome, David. I'm really glad I could help, and again, I apologize for the confusion on the promotional rate terms. If you have any questions going forward, don't hesitate to reach out. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thank you.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day, David.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
