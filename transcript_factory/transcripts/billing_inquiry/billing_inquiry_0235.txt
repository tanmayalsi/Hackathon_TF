Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I just got my statement and there's a charge on here that shouldn't be there.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under Marcus Chen.

Agent: Perfect, thank you, Marcus. I've got your account right here. So you're seeing a charge that looks incorrect? Can you tell me which charge is concerning you?

Customer: Yeah, so I've been paying... I think it was $79.99 a month for the gigabit fiber plan? And this month my bill jumped to $94.99. That's like a fifteen dollar increase and nobody told me about it.

Agent: (pause) I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at what's showing on your account here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you were on a promotional rate that expired at the end of last month. Your account shows you were grandfathered into a twelve-month promotional rate back in... looks like March of last year.

Customer: Okay, but I never got notified about that. I mean, I didn't even know my promotional rate was expiring. If I had known, I probably would've done something about it.

Agent: Yeah, I completely understand. Typically we do send out notifications about thirty days before a promotional rate expires, but let me check your communication preferences here... (pause, typing sounds) It looks like the notification may have gone to an email address that's no longer on file with us. Did you possibly change your email address recently?

Customer: Oh, I mean... I did change my email like six months ago, but I thought I updated that with you guys.

Agent: Okay, well that might explain why you didn't receive the courtesy notification. I'm really sorry about that. But here's the good news—the rate you're being charged now at $94.99, that's actually our standard rate for gigabit fiber in your area, and it's competitive with what we're offering new customers. However, I do have some options that might help.

Customer: Okay, what kind of options?

Agent: Well, I can look into current promotions we have available. Let me see... (typing sounds) So we do have a promotional offer right now where we can get you back down to $84.99 a month for the first six months if you agree to a new twelve-month service agreement. After that six-month period, it would go back to the standard rate of $94.99.

Customer: Hmm, so it would just go back up again in six months? That doesn't really solve the problem.

Agent: I hear you. That's not ideal, and I appreciate you being upfront about that. Let me see what else I can do. (pause, typing sounds) One thing I can do is credit you for one month at the promotional rate to help offset this increase. So that would be... $79.99 back to your account as a one-time courtesy credit, and then we can go ahead and enroll you in that $84.99 promotional offer for six months.

Customer: (pause) So I'm looking at $84.99 after the credit?

Agent: Correct. The credit of $79.99 will appear on your account within one to two billing cycles, which will essentially offset this month's overage. And then starting next month, your rate would be $84.99 for six months, and then $94.99 after that.

Customer: ...And there's no way to lock in a lower rate for longer than six months?

Agent: (pause) You know what, let me actually check something for you. Give me just one moment. (hold music, about 20 seconds) Okay, I'm back. So I was able to speak with my supervisor, and because you've been a loyal customer for over a year, we can actually do nine months at $84.99 instead of six. So you'd have an extra three months at that lower rate before it goes back to the standard rate.

Customer: Nine months is better... I guess. Okay, yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Awesome, thank you for giving us the opportunity to make this right, Marcus. So just to confirm, I'm going to apply a one-time courtesy credit of $79.99 to your account. Your new rate will be $84.99 per month for nine months starting with your next billing cycle, after which it will move to the standard rate of $94.99. Does that sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine. And you're gonna update my email address too, right? So I actually get the notifications next time?

Agent: Absolutely. What email address would you like me to have on file?

Customer: It's marcus.chen at gmail dot com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I've got that updated. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: My pleasure, Marcus. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and I apologize again that you didn't receive that notification. We really do value your business. Your confirmation number is 847392—you can reference that if you need to reach us again. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Goodbye.
