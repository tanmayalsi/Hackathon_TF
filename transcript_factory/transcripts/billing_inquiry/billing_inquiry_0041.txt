# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement for this month and there's a charge that doesn't make any sense.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get a name please?

Customer: It's Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. I've got your account here. What charge are you seeing that seems incorrect?

Customer: Well, so last month my bill was $89.99 a month for the Fiber 500 plan, right? And this month it jumped to $119.99. That's like a $30 increase! I haven't added any services or anything. I just want to know why that happened.

Agent: (pause) I completely understand your frustration, Jennifer. Let me look into that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history. I see that you did have a promotional rate that expired at the end of last month.

Customer: A promotional rate? I wasn't aware I was on a promotional rate. I've been a customer for... I don't even know, three years maybe? Why would they put me on a promotional rate and then just... take it away?

Agent: That's a really good question. It looks like when you signed up, you received a 12-month promotional offer at $89.99, and that period has now concluded. So your account has transitioned to the standard rate for that plan.

Customer: (pause) But nobody told me. I mean, I never got a letter or a call or anything. Wouldn't you guys notify customers before something like this happens?

Agent: That's a fair point. We should have sent you a notification letter about 30 days before the promotion ended. Let me look here... (typing sounds) I'm not seeing that notification marked as delivered in our system. That's on us, and I apologize for that.

Customer: Okay, so what can we do about it? Because I can't just absorb a $30 increase out of nowhere. That's a lot of money.

Agent: I hear you. Let me see what options I have here. (typing sounds, pause) So, a couple of things I can do. First, I can provide you with a new promotional rate. We currently have an offer for existing customers where I can put you on Fiber 500 for $99.99 for the next 12 months. That's still lower than the standard rate, and it's better than where you are now.

Customer: $99.99? So I'd still be paying $10 more than I was before?

Agent: Yes, but that's actually our best current offer for the plan you have. However, I could also look at transitioning you to our Fiber 300 plan, which is actually very solid for most customers, and that would be $79.99 for 12 months with the same promotional offer.

Customer: What's the difference between the 300 and the 500?

Agent: Great question. The main difference is download speeds. The 500 plan gives you up to 500 megabits per second, and the 300 gives you up to 300 megabits. For most streaming, browsing, and even working from home, the 300 is really sufficient unless you have multiple people using the connection simultaneously for bandwidth-heavy activities.

Customer: I work from home, so I do video calls a lot. Would 300 be enough for that?

Agent: Absolutely. Video calls typically use about 2.5 megabits per second, so you'd be more than fine with the 300 plan. You'd still have plenty of headroom.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so you're saying you can get me back down to $79.99 if I downgrade?

Agent: That's correct. Fiber 300 at $79.99 per month for 12 months, and at the end of that period, we can revisit and explore other options.

Customer: And you'll actually notify me before that promotional period ends, right?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I'm going to make a note on your account right now indicating that you should receive a courtesy notification 60 days before the rate change, actually—that's better than the standard 30.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I guess that makes sense. But I'm kind of annoyed that this happened in the first place. I feel like I'm being... I don't know, nickel and dimed.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize again for the lack of notification. This is on us. Tell you what—in addition to the promotional rate I'm offering, let me credit your account for this month's overage. So that $30 difference between the $89.99 and the $119.99, I'm going to put that back on your account as a credit.

Customer: (pause) Really?

Agent: Yes, really. It's the least I can do given that we didn't inform you properly about the rate change.

Customer: Okay, well... thank you. I appreciate that.

Agent: Of course. So, to confirm, I'm going to apply the Fiber 300 plan at $79.99 per month for the next 12 months, and I'm crediting your account $30 for this month. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. When does this take effect?

Agent: (typing sounds) It'll be effective on your next billing cycle, which is... let me see here... that would be three days from now. You should see the new rate on your next statement, and the credit will show up within 24 hours.

Customer: Perfect. And how do I know if there's any speed difference with the 300 plan? Like, do I need to do anything?

Agent: You shouldn't notice much of a difference, honestly. The transition is automatic on our end. Your service will continue uninterrupted, but technically your speeds are capped at 300 instead of 500. Most customers don't notice because they're nowhere near maxing out their connection anyway.

Customer: Okay, good. Well, I think that takes care of it then.

Agent: Great! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for helping me out and for the credit.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. And again, I apologize for the confusion with the promotional rate. We appreciate your business, and if you ever have any issues in the future, don't hesitate to give us a call.

Customer: I will. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, Jennifer. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.
