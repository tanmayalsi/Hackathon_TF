# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. Can I have your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, it's 555-0147. I'm calling because my bill just jumped up like crazy this month and I need to figure out what's going on.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Jennifer Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: (typing) Perfect, Jennifer. I've got your account here. I can see your service address is on Maple Street in Bozeman?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned your bill increased. Let me take a look at what we're seeing here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your last bill from last month and comparing it to this current one. I can definitely see there's a difference. Your previous bill was $79.99 and your current bill is $109.99. That's about a $30 increase. Is that what you're seeing on your end?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. That's... that's pretty significant. I haven't changed anything. I'm still on the same Fiber 200 plan I've had for like, what, two years now? And I never agreed to anything like that.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me break down what I'm seeing here. (typing) It looks like you were on our promotional rate of $79.99 per month, which was a first-year promotion that ended last month. So your rate has moved to our standard Fiber 200 rate, which is $109.99. That's... that's where this increase is coming from.

Customer: (pause) A promotional rate? But nobody told me that was going to expire. How is that fair? I mean, I've been a good customer. I pay on time, I've never had any problems...

Agent: I absolutely hear you, and I apologize that this came as a surprise. These promotional rates are... they are time-limited offers, and typically they last for 12 months from the date of activation. It looks like your promotion ended on March 15th. And I do see that we sent out a notification letter about 30 days prior to that, so around mid-February, but I understand that's easy to miss sometimes.

Customer: I don't remember getting anything like that. I mean, is there anything you can do? Can you put me back on that promotional rate?

Agent: Let me see what options we have available to you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so unfortunately the introductory promotion you were on has expired and I'm not able to reinstate that specific offer. However, I am seeing that we do have some current promotions available for existing customers. There is a... hold on one second... (pause) We have a rate lock option where I could move you to a Fiber 200 plan at $89.99 per month, and that would be locked in for 12 months. So that would be a $20 savings per month compared to your current standard rate.

Customer: So instead of $109.99, I'd pay $89.99?

Agent: That's correct, yes. $89.99 for 12 months with a rate lock guarantee. After that 12-month period, the rate would be subject to change, but at least you'd have that protection for the next year.

Customer: (pause) I... okay, well that's better than $110. But I'm still frustrated that I didn't know the promotion was ending. Why wouldn't Frontier just notify customers more clearly? Like, I get tons of junk mail, but I might have missed something important.

Agent: That's fair feedback, and I do apologize. The letter should have been pretty clear, but I understand how easy it is for these things to slip through. What I can do is make a note on your account about this, and we can definitely make sure you're made aware well in advance before this next rate lock expires in 12 months. We can add you to our courtesy notification list.

Customer: Okay... yeah, I appreciate that. And if I go with this $89.99 option, there's nothing else tacked on, right? No equipment fees or anything popping up later?

Agent: (typing) No, this is just the service rate. Your modem lease is separate, and I'm showing that you have that at $13.99 per month, which would remain the same. But the $89.99 is just for the internet service itself. And if you wanted to own your modem outright instead of leasing it, I can provide information on that, but that's totally optional.

Customer: No, I think the lease is fine for now. I just... I need to know my bill every month. Okay, let's do the $89.99 plan then.

Agent: Excellent. I'm going to apply that rate lock promotion to your account right now. (typing sounds) Perfect. So effective immediately, your new rate will be $89.99 per month, and this rate is guaranteed through March 15th of next year. You should see this reflected on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay. And you mentioned you're going to add me to a list so I get notified?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I'm adding a note right now that you're to receive advance notification before any rate changes. You'll get that notification at least 30 days in advance, so you'll have time to review your options.

Customer: Alright. Thank you. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: You're welcome, Jennifer. And again, I apologize for the inconvenience with the rate increase. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm good.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and thank you for being a loyal customer. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
