# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, thanks for picking up. Um, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually I do recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it to be this high.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number, please? It should be on your bill.

Customer: Yeah, it's 4-7-2-8-1-9-0-5.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Mueller. M-U-E-L-L-E-R.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got you here. And what seems to be the issue with your bill, James?

Customer: Well, so I've been with Frontier for... I don't know, like three years now? And my bill's always been like $79.99 for the 500 meg fiber plan, right? But this month it's showing $109.99. That's like a thirty dollar increase! I didn't agree to any of that.

Agent: I understand your frustration. That's definitely a significant jump. Let me pull up your account details here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your billing history. It looks like you were on a promotional rate that was set to expire. That promotional period was 24 months, and it looks like it just ended about two weeks ago.

Customer: Wait, what? A promotional... I mean, nobody told me about this. If I'd known my bill was going to jump like that, I would've... I don't know, I would've done something about it.

Agent: Yeah, I completely understand. Let me look into what happened with that notification. (pause) (typing sounds) So I do see that we sent a notification email on October 15th letting you know that your promotional rate was expiring and what your new rate would be. It looks like that went to the email address on file.

Customer: Well, I... I might not have seen that, honestly. I get a ton of emails. Can you, like, just keep me on the promotional rate? Or can you offer me something else?

Agent: (pause) I can definitely look into some options for you. We actually have a new promotional offer I can put on your account. Since you've been a loyal customer for three years, I can offer you a one-year promotion that would bring you back down to $84.99 per month for the 500 meg service. That's a five dollar increase from what you were paying, but it's locked in for the next twelve months.

Customer: So it's still going up?

Agent: Yes, unfortunately. The rate would increase by five dollars. However, after that year-long promo ends, if you renew, I'm confident we can work with you on another promotional rate at that time.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, but what if I just... what if I don't want to do that? What if I think that's still too expensive? Are there other options?

Agent: You do have a few options. We could scale you back to our 300 meg plan, which would be $64.99 after the promotional period. Or if you're interested, we have a 1 gig plan that's actually promotional right now at $99.99 for the first year, which is a better value if you need higher speeds.

Customer: No, I don't need gigabit speeds. I'm just... I'm frustrated, you know? I feel like you guys are nickel and diming me here. I've been a good customer, I pay on time, and now suddenly my bill's going up.

Agent: I really do hear your frustration, James, and I appreciate your loyalty. (pause) You know what, let me see what else I can do here. Give me just one second. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to put you on a special retention offer. I can do eighteen months at $87.99 for the 500 meg plan instead of the one year at $84.99. That gives you a little bit longer locked in, and it's only about eight dollars more than your promotional rate.

Customer: Eighteen months?

Agent: That's correct. So you'd be at $87.99 per month for the next year and a half, and then we can revisit at that time.

Customer: (pause) How much is that total?

Agent: (typing sounds) So if we do the math, that would be about $1,583.82 over the eighteen month period. Versus if we went with just the one-year option at $84.99, that would be $1,019.88 for the year.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) I mean, it's still frustrating, but... I guess that's a little better than $109.99. And you're saying you can lock that in for eighteen months?

Agent: Absolutely. I can add that to your account right now. It'll take effect on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Let's do that. But I want to make sure I understand what I'm being charged for, so can you walk me through what I'm paying for? I want to make sure there aren't any other surprise charges.

Agent: Of course! So your service is the 500 megabit fiber internet plan at $87.99. You have the standard equipment fee for the fiber gateway router, which is included in that price. You don't have any add-on services like phone or streaming. The only other charge you might see is if you have any equipment damage that's not covered by our warranty, but that wouldn't show up unless something happens. Are you currently under a month-to-month agreement, or do you have any contract terms?

Customer: I think month-to-month. I've been with you guys for so long, I don't remember honestly.

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, it looks like you're month-to-month, which is great. So there's no early termination fee or anything like that. The only thing changing is the promotional rate adjustment.

Customer: Okay, good. And when does this change take effect?

Agent: It'll go into effect on your next billing cycle. When is your billing date?

Customer: I think it's the 12th of each month.

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, that's correct. So as of December 12th, your new rate of $87.99 will kick in. You'll get a confirmation email today with all the details of the change and the new billing information.

Customer: Alright. And just to confirm, this is locked in for eighteen months, right?

Agent: That's right. Eighteen months at $87.99 per month for your 500 meg fiber plan. And then we'll definitely work with you on another option when that promotion ends.

Customer: Okay. I appreciate that, Derek. I'm not thrilled about any increase, but I guess this is better than thirty dollars.

Agent: I really appreciate your understanding, James. And I'm sorry we couldn't keep things exactly the way they were. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and thank you for calling in today. You should get that confirmation email within the next few minutes. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
