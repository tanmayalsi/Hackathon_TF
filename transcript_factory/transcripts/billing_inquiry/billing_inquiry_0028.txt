# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and the price went up like thirty dollars. That seems really high, and I'm not sure why that happened.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147. That's the area code... 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get your name?

Customer: It's David Chen.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright David, I'm pulling up your account here. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your account now. So you mentioned your bill went up about thirty dollars?

Customer: Yeah, thirty-two dollars to be exact. I've been with Frontier for like three years, and my bill has been pretty consistent. I'm just... I don't understand why it jumped all of a sudden. Nobody called me about a price increase or anything.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me look at your billing history here. (typing sounds) Okay, so looking at your last three months... your July statement was $89.99, then August came in at $105.99, and then September is $121.99. Is that... is that what you're seeing?

Customer: Well, I... (pause) okay, so it looks like it's been going up gradually each month? I thought it was just one big jump this month, but... yeah, that's... that's not great.

Agent: Right, and I can see why that would be concerning. Let me check here... (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your service plan. You have our Frontier Fiber 200 internet package, and then you also have our premium Wi-Fi router rental. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I think so. I have the internet service, and then... yeah, I think there's a router thing included with it.

Agent: Okay. So what I'm seeing here is that back in July, you were grandfathered into a promotional rate of $79.99 a month for the Fiber 200 plan. However, that promotional period ended at the end of July, and your rate adjusted to our standard pricing, which is $99.99 a month. And then... (pause) oh, I see here that in September, we also added a service fee adjustment because we... we had a system upgrade in your area.

Customer: Okay, so wait. So the promotional rate ended without anyone telling me? Like, shouldn't I have gotten some kind of notice or something?

Agent: (pause) That's a fair question. Let me check your account notes here. (typing sounds) So looking back, it looks like there was a notice sent approximately thirty days before the promotional period ended. It should have been included with your June bill. Did you happen to see that?

Customer: I... I don't know. I mean, I get my bills digitized usually, and I just pay them online. I don't really read through all the fine print every time, you know?

Agent: I hear you. That's pretty common actually. So technically the notice was sent, but I completely understand that it's easy to miss. As for the service fee adjustment in September, that's a $12 fee that we charge when we do infrastructure upgrades in a customer's service area. It's typically temporary and should drop off in a couple of months.

Customer: (sighs) So what, I'm just stuck with this? Because I can't afford to pay $122 a month for internet. That's not... I mean, when I signed up, it was supposed to be around eighty bucks.

Agent: I understand. Let me see what options I have available for you here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so here's what I can do. I can't reinstate the old promotional rate since that program has expired, but I do have some current promotional offers available. I can move you to our Fiber 100 plan, which is $69.99 a month—that's twenty dollars less than what you're paying now for the Fiber 200.

Customer: But that's slower internet, right? I need the faster speed for my work. I work from home, so I need reliable, fast internet.

Agent: That's completely understandable. Um, let me check if there are any other promotions I can apply... (typing sounds) Okay, so I do have a loyalty promotion that I can apply to your account. I can reduce your rate to $89.99 a month for the Fiber 200 plan—that's $10 off the standard rate. That would bring you down from the $121.99 you're currently paying.

Customer: So I'm still paying more than I was three months ago, though. I'd be paying $89.99 instead of $79.99. That's still a ten-dollar increase from where I started.

Agent: You're right, and I apologize. The thing is, the promotional rate you had was a special offer that was limited-time. The standard rate for Fiber 200 is $99.99, so the $89.99 I'm offering is actually below our standard pricing. (pause) Is there... I mean, if budget is a concern, I can also waive the $12 service fee adjustment from September as a one-time courtesy. That would help bring your bill down immediately.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so if you waive that fee and I take the $89.99 rate, what would my next bill be?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me calculate that for you. So your current bill cycle ends on the 15th of this month, so your next full bill would start on the 16th. With the $89.99 rate and the waived September fee, your next bill should be around $92.99 for the month, which includes taxes and fees.

Customer: (pause) Alright. And this is just for like, one month? Or is this a promotional period?

Agent: The $89.99 rate is good for twelve months. So you're locked in at that rate for the next year, and then after that, we can revisit and see what options are available at that time.

Customer: Okay. I mean, that's... that's better than what I have now, but I'm not thrilled about it. I feel like I should have been better informed about the promotion ending.

Agent: I really do understand your frustration, David, and I sincerely apologize that the notice wasn't more prominent. Is there anything else I can help clarify about your billing or your service?

Customer: No, I think... (pause) yeah, okay. Let's go ahead and make those changes.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to apply the $89.99 loyalty rate to your account effective immediately, and I'm waiving that $12 September service fee. (typing sounds) Alright, all set. You should see those changes reflected on your next bill. You'll receive a confirmation email at the email address we have on file, which is... (pause) c-dot-chen-82@mailbox-dot-com. Is that still the correct email?

Customer: Yeah, that's fine.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome, David. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
