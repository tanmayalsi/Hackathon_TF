# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yes, hi. I'm calling because I just received my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Plus, my monthly rate went up, and nobody told me about it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. And my name is Janet Murphy.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Janet, thank you. Let me pull up your account here... Alright, I'm looking at your most recent bill from October. I can see there was an increase. Before we dive into that, what's the charge you're disputing?

Customer: There's a $49.99 line item that just says "Professional Installation Fee" but I didn't ask for any installation. My service has been fine. I've had it for... gosh, almost three years now.

Agent: I understand your concern. Let me look into that for you. (pause, typing sounds) Hmm, okay, so I'm not seeing any recent service visits on your account. When did you receive this bill?

Customer: This morning. That's why I'm calling. I opened it up and just... I mean, I'm already paying $89.99 a month for your internet, and now there's this extra fifty bucks plus the rate went up by ten dollars. It's ridiculous.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Janet. Let me explain what I'm seeing here. Your standard service rate did increase, and I apologize that you didn't receive advance notice about that. That's something I can definitely help address. As for the installation fee, I'm going to need to investigate that a bit further because there's no service visit noted on your account.

Customer: So what are you saying? I shouldn't have been charged for it?

Agent: Well, I want to make sure we get to the bottom of this. Sometimes fees can be applied in error, or there might be a system note I'm not seeing yet. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check with my supervisor on this. It should only be about two minutes. Is that okay?

Customer: Fine, but hurry up please. I have a dentist appointment at two.

Agent: (hold music, approximately 90 seconds)

Agent: Thank you for holding, Janet. Okay, so I spoke with my supervisor, and here's what we found. It looks like that installation fee may have been applied during a system update we did last month. It was an error on our end, and I sincerely apologize for that.

Customer: So you're saying I'm getting refunded?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I'm going to credit that $49.99 back to your account effective immediately. You should see that reflected on your next bill or within one to two business days if you check online.

Customer: Okay, well that's something, at least. But what about the rate increase? Why wasn't I notified? I feel like you guys always just sneakily raise the rates without telling anyone.

Agent: That's a fair point, and I apologize for the lack of communication on our end. We are required to provide notice, but I understand it's easy to miss or that information might come in a separate mailing. Your rate increased because of infrastructure improvements we've made to the network in your area, which actually means you're getting faster and more reliable service.

Customer: I don't want faster service. I want cheaper service. (laughs) Seriously though, is there anything you can do about this rate increase?

Agent: I hear you. Let me see what promotions or discounts I have available. (typing sounds) Alright, so because you've been a loyal customer for three years and you've had this billing issue, I can offer you a one-time $20 credit that I can apply to your account, which would cover that $10 rate increase plus an additional $10 off your next month's bill.

Customer: So that's a one-time thing?

Agent: That would be a one-time credit, yes. However, if you're interested in looking at different service packages, I could also... [inaudible] ...offer you our bundle package with phone and television service, which would actually bring your overall monthly bill down by about $15.

Customer: I don't want phone and television. I just want internet, and I want to pay what I was paying before.

Agent: I understand. I wish I could lock in rates indefinitely, but unfortunately, these increases are necessary to maintain and upgrade our network infrastructure. What I can do is note your account that you're a valued customer, and if there are any future promotions available for your service tier, you'll be first in line to hear about them.

Customer: (sighs) Fine. Okay. So to be clear, what are you doing for me today?

Agent: Great question. So here's what's being applied to your account: First, the $49.99 erroneous installation fee is being credited back. Second, I'm applying a one-time $20 credit to help offset the rate increase. That means your next bill should be approximately $69.99 instead of the $99.99 you're seeing now.

Customer: Alright. I guess that's better. Do I need to do anything on my end?

Agent: No, nothing at all. Both credits will be applied automatically. You should see them reflected within the next billing cycle. And Janet, I really do apologize for the confusion and the lack of notification about the rate increase. We'll do better.

Customer: Okay. Thank you, Marcus. I appreciate you helping me out.

Agent: My pleasure. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, Janet, and thank you for calling in. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
