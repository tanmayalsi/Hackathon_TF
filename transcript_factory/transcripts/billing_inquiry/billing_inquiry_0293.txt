Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that shouldn't be there. My internet bill basically doubled.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And just to verify, is this account under the name David Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. Alright David, I'm looking at your account now. I can see your bill from last month was $79.99, and your current bill is showing as $159.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. It went from like eighty bucks to almost one-sixty. That's... I mean, that's basically double. I haven't changed anything on my account. Why would that happen?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. That is quite a jump. Let me look into this. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that your promotional rate expired. You were on a twelve-month promotional offer for our Fiber 500 plan at $79.99, and that promotion ended at the end of last month.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't... nobody told me about this. I mean, I should've been notified or something, right?

Agent: You know, that's a fair point. We do send out notifications about promotional expirations, but I understand these things can get missed or end up in spam. Once a promotion ends, the standard rate for that service does apply. For the Fiber 500 plan in your area, the standard rate is $159.99 a month.

Customer: This is ridiculous. I've been a customer for... (pause) ...I've been with you guys for almost three years now. Why would you guys just double my rate like that?

Agent: I hear you, David. And I appreciate your loyalty. Let me see what options we have available. (typing sounds) Alright, so I do have some promotional pricing we can offer you right now. We have a current promotion for new and returning customers. How does this sound—I can put you on our Fiber 300 plan at $69.99 for the first twelve months, then it would go to $129.99 after that.

Customer: So I'm still paying more than what I was paying before, even with the discount?

Agent: That's correct, after the first year. However, the Fiber 300 plan is still very robust—it's 300 megabits per second. Most households find that's more than sufficient for streaming, video calls, working from home...

Customer: But I didn't have any issues with the Fiber 500. I was happy with what I had. Why should I downgrade?

Agent: That's understandable. Let me check what else I might be able to do here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I can actually offer you the Fiber 500 plan—so keep the same speed you had—at $99.99 for the next twelve months. That's a $60 decrease from the standard rate, and it's better than your original promotional price.

Customer: For how long though? And then what? It jumps back up to one-sixty?

Agent: Yes, after twelve months it would return to the standard rate of $159.99. But at that time, you could always call us back and we can look at what promotions we have available then. I know that's not a perfect answer, but it does give you a year at a better rate.

Customer: (sighs) That's... I mean, it's better I guess, but it still bothers me that I wasn't reminded about the promotion ending. Like, you guys should be more upfront about that.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I appreciate that feedback. I can make a note on your account about that, and I'll also have this information sent to our customer service manager. We do want to make sure our customers are aware of when their rates are changing. Is there anything else I can help clarify about the new promotional offer?

Customer: No, I think... okay, let's do the $99.99 for Fiber 500. But I'm gonna call back before that year is up because I'm definitely not paying one-sixty again if I can help it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely, that's a smart plan. I'm going to go ahead and apply that promotion to your account right now. The new rate of $99.99 will show on your next billing cycle. You should see that reflected... (pause) ...yes, it'll be effective immediately, so your next bill will be at the new rate. And David, please do call us back. We'll work with you to find the best option available at that time.

Customer: Okay, thanks Marcus. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course, and again, I'm sorry you had this experience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Great. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, David. Have a wonderful day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
