Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I've been a customer for, I don't know, five or six years now, and this is the first time I'm seeing this.

Agent: I appreciate you calling in about that. I'd be happy to help you look into this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... (pause) ...555-0147. That's the number on the bill.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for your residence on Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's right. How did you...?

Agent: It's right here in our system. Okay, I'm pulling up your account now. Can you tell me which charge is concerning you?

Customer: Yeah, so on this bill—my June bill—there's a line item that says "Fiber Network Upgrade Fee" for $14.99, and I have no idea what that is. I'm already paying for fiber internet. Why am I being charged for an upgrade I didn't ask for?

Agent: (pause) Okay, I see that. Let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) So it looks like this fee was added to your account starting in June as part of a network infrastructure upgrade we performed in your service area. This helps us maintain and improve the quality of service to all our customers.

Customer: But I didn't sign up for that. I mean, I'm already paying for your service. Why should I have to pay extra? And more importantly, why wasn't I notified about this?

Agent: Those are great questions, and I completely understand your frustration. Typically, customers in your area should have received a notification about this upgrade fee. Let me check if there's a record of that notification being sent to you.

Customer: Well, I didn't get anything. At least not that I saw. How much is this going to keep showing up on my bill?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so this is a recurring fee that was set to continue on your account. However, I want to make this right for you. Let me see what options we have. (pause) Can you hold for just one moment while I check with my supervisor about what we can do here?

Customer: Sure, I guess.

Agent: (hold music plays for about 15 seconds)

Agent: Thank you for holding. Okay, so here's what I can do. I'm going to credit your account for the June charge of $14.99. Additionally, I'm going to remove this recurring fee from your account entirely.

Customer: (pause) You're removing it? Just like that?

Agent: Yes. Since you didn't authorize this upgrade and didn't receive proper notification—which is on us—I think it's fair to remove it. You'll no longer see that charge going forward.

Customer: Okay, well... I appreciate that. That's helpful. But I'm still frustrated that this happened in the first place. Is there anything else I should know about? Are there any other fees being added without my knowledge?

Agent: That's a fair concern. Let me pull up your full billing history here. (typing sounds) Looking at your account, I see you have our standard fiber internet package at $79.99 per month. That's been consistent for the last year. The network upgrade fee was the only additional charge that was added. Going forward, your bill should go back to your normal amount.

Customer: Alright. And when will I see the credit for the fourteen ninety-nine?

Agent: The credit should appear on your next billing cycle, which would be around July 15th based on your account. You'll see it listed as a one-time credit adjustment.

Customer: Okay, that works. Derek, I appreciate you taking care of this. I just wish your company had communicated better about this from the start.

Agent: I completely understand, and I really appreciate your patience. You've been a loyal customer for several years, and we value that. I'm going to add a note to your account about this situation so if you have any other questions, the team will be aware of what happened.

Customer: Thanks. I think that's everything I needed.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Any questions about your service or your bill?

Customer: No, I think we're good.

Agent: Alright, well thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. You should receive that credit within a billing cycle. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, Derek. Bye.

Agent: Take care!
