# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and... I don't know, something doesn't seem right.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my service address.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account here for... Sarah Martinez, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So what's going on with your bill today, Sarah?

Customer: Well, I've been a customer for... I don't know, like three years now? And my bill has always been $79.99 a month for the fiber internet package. But this month I got charged $109.99. That's thirty dollars more. I didn't sign up for anything extra or upgrade or anything like that, so I'm not sure why I'm being charged more.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Let me take a look at what's on your account. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so looking at your billing history here, I can see that you're right—your bill was $79.99 for quite some time. But I'm seeing that on your last renewal date, which would have been... (pause) ...about six weeks ago, your promotional rate expired.

Customer: What do you mean, expired? I didn't know I was on a promotional rate. Nobody told me about that.

Agent: I apologize for the confusion. So when you originally signed up, you were placed on a promotional pricing for the first year. That was $79.99 per month for our Gigabit fiber internet service. That promotion ended, and now you've been transitioned to our standard rate, which is $109.99 per month for that same service.

Customer: But... I mean, that doesn't make sense. Why would you just change my rate without letting me know? That's a pretty big jump.

Agent: You know, I hear you. Typically, we do send out a notice before the promotional rate ends. Let me check if there was a notification sent to your account. (typing sounds) It looks like we sent out a notice about thirty days before your renewal... (pause) ...to the email address on file. Did you happen to receive that?

Customer: I... maybe? I get a lot of emails, honestly. But the point is, I feel like this should have been more obvious. And frankly, I don't think I should have to pay $109.99. That's way too much. Is there anything you can do about this?

Agent: I understand your frustration, Sarah. And I do want to help. What I can do is look at what promotions we have available right now for existing customers. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so here's what I'm seeing. We have a twelve-month promotional offer for our Gigabit fiber service at $89.99 per month. That's lower than the standard rate, though it's higher than what you were paying before.

Customer: But I shouldn't have to take another promotion. I was happy with my rate. Can't you just keep my old rate?

Agent: I completely understand wanting to keep your rate. Unfortunately, I don't have the ability to grandfather in previous promotional pricing. The way our system works, once a promotion ends, we have to move customers to either the standard rate or offer them a new promotional rate. I can't manually override and lock in the previous price.

Customer: (sighs) That's really frustrating. So my options are either pay $109.99 or take another promotion that's $89.99 but only for a year?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. And I want to be transparent with you—after that twelve-month period is up, you'd see an increase to the standard rate again. But the $89.99 rate would save you $20 per month compared to the standard rate.

Customer: So basically, I'm just going to be in this cycle of rate increases every year?

Agent: I understand it feels that way. The reality is that promotional rates are designed to be introductory offers. Most service providers do something similar. But I want to make sure you're getting the best value. The $89.99 rate is still a solid rate for gigabit fiber internet service. Plus, your service has been reliable with us, right?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, the internet has been good. No complaints there. It's just the billing part that's annoying.

Agent: I totally get it. Let me see if there's anything else I can do. (pause, typing sounds) One thing I can offer is if you'd like to move forward with the $89.99 promotional rate, I can apply a one-time bill credit of $30 to your account. That would help offset the charge you received this month.

Customer: Really? You can do that?

Agent: Yes, I can. It's a one-time courtesy credit for the inconvenience of the rate change and to help account for the difference this month. So your bill this month would be $109.99, but we'd credit back $30, which would bring it down to $79.99—your original rate.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's... that's actually helpful. I appreciate that. So if I go with the $89.99 plan, that credit gets applied this billing cycle?

Agent: Exactly. The credit would apply to your current bill, and then starting next month, your rate would be $89.99 for the next twelve months. After that year is up, if you don't take another promotional offer, you'd move to the standard rate again.

Customer: Alright. I mean, I'd still prefer to stay at $79.99, but I get it. That's just how it works, I guess. Let's do the $89.99 plan.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to go ahead and process that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm applying the twelve-month promotional rate of $89.99 and adding the $30 one-time courtesy credit to your account. That should all be reflected on your next bill. You'll see the credit applied this cycle, and then starting next month, you'll be charged $89.99.

Customer: Great. Thank you for that.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. And again, I apologize for the confusion with the rate change. We do appreciate your business, Sarah. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to reach out anytime. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
