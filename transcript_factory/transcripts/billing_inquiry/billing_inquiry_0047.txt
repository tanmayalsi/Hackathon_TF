Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I think I'm being overcharged.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... let me find it. Okay, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get a name for the account?

Customer: It's Jennifer Walsh.

Agent: Thank you, Jennifer. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) Okay, I've got it. So you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize. Can you tell me which charge that is or what the amount is?

Customer: Yes, so my bill this month is $89.99, but last month it was $59.99. That's a thirty-dollar increase, and I wasn't told about any price change. I've had the same plan for like... two years now. What's going on?

Agent: I understand your frustration, Jennifer. A thirty-dollar jump is definitely significant. Let me take a look at what's on your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your service plan is our standard Fiber 300 package at $59.99, but it looks like... ah, yes. I see what happened here.

Customer: What? What happened?

Agent: So it appears that your promotional rate expired. You were on a two-year promotional offer that was set to end this month. Your rate has gone back to the regular price, which is $89.99 per month.

Customer: (pause) Wait, what? I was never told about this. Nobody called me or sent me a letter saying my rate was going to go up. That's not fair.

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from. Let me check your account notes to see if there was any notification sent. (typing sounds) It looks like we did send a notification letter about sixty days ago, but I can see how that might have gotten missed in the mail. A lot of people don't open those. Is there anything else on the bill that's concerning you, or is it mainly the rate increase?

Customer: No, I mean, that's the main thing. But seriously, Derek, I feel like you guys should have called me or emailed me or something more than just a letter. I've been a customer for... when did I start? Like five or six years?

Agent: You've been with us since 2019, so that's about five years. That's great to hear, and we definitely value your loyalty. What I can do is... let me see what options are available to you. (pause) Are you still interested in keeping your service with us?

Customer: Well, I mean, I don't really have a choice, do I? You're the only fiber provider in my area. But I'm not happy about the price increase. Can you do anything about it?

Agent: I hear you. Let me look at what promotions we currently have available. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm showing that I can't apply the two-year promotional rate again since you just had one, but I do have access to a loyalty discount. I can apply a $15-per-month credit to your account for the next twelve months, which would bring your bill down to $74.99.

Customer: (hesitant) Fifteen dollars? So it would still be fifteen dollars more than what I was paying before.

Agent: Yes, that's correct. I wish I could do more, Jennifer. The promotional rate at $59.99 was our introductory offer, and the regular price for that speed tier is the $89.99. But with the loyalty credit, you'd be saving $180 over the next year compared to the full regular rate.

Customer: (sighs) Hmm. Can you... is there any way you could match the old price for a few more months while I think about my options?

Agent: I understand the desire to keep things stable. Unfortunately, the loyalty credit I mentioned is the best offer I'm able to apply right now. However, if you'd like, I can put a note on your account and have our retention team reach out to you with any additional offers that might become available in the next billing cycle or so. We do get new promotions from time to time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I... yeah, I guess that would be helpful. But I still think this is kind of a bum deal. You should really be more upfront about this stuff.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I appreciate that feedback. We'll definitely take that into consideration. Let me go ahead and apply that $15 monthly loyalty credit to your account right now, and I'll add that note about having our retention team contact you.

Customer: Okay. So when does the credit start?

Agent: The credit will apply to your next billing cycle, which would start on... (typing sounds) the 18th of next month. So your bill should show the reduced amount then.

Customer: All right. Thank you, I guess.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything.

Agent: Okay, Jennifer. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer for the past five years. We really do appreciate your business. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to reach out. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye, Jennifer.
