Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that wasn't on my account before. I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. Just one moment... Alright, I've got your account here. Your name is Richard Hutchins?

Customer: That's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize. Can you tell me what the charge is for, or do you want me to walk you through your bill?

Customer: Well, that's the thing—I don't know what it is. I see it listed as "Premium Service Package—$19.99" but I never added anything like that to my plan. I've got the basic fiber internet and that's all I wanted. I've been with you guys for three years and this is the first time something like this has shown up.

Agent: Okay, I understand your concern. Let me look at your account history here. (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm seeing that on... looks like February 3rd, there was a change made to your account. It shows a Premium Service Package was added. Do you remember making any changes around that time, or...?

Customer: No, I absolutely did not. I didn't call, I didn't go online, nothing. This is ridiculous. I want it removed and I want a credit for this month.

Agent: I totally understand your frustration. Let me look into this a bit more. (typing sounds) Do you happen to remember if you received any emails or notifications around that time? Sometimes there can be... um, system glitches, or in rare cases, there could be unauthorized account access.

Customer: (sighs) I don't think so. I usually just ignore the promotional emails you guys send me anyway. Could someone have just added this to my account without my permission?

Agent: That's definitely not something we'd do on our end intentionally. However, I can see that the change was made. I'm going to need to investigate this a bit further. What I can do for you right now is remove that Premium Service Package from your account, which will stop any future charges for it.

Customer: Finally. Yes, please do that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm processing that removal now. You should see that reflected on your next bill. As for the $19.99 charge from this month, I'm going to need to escalate this to our billing department to see if we can issue you a credit for that charge. They'll typically review cases like this within 24 to 48 hours, and you'll get a call back or an email confirmation.

Customer: So I'm not getting an automatic credit right now?

Agent: Unfortunately, I don't have the authority to issue credits directly. Our billing team handles those kinds of adjustments after they've reviewed the account. But I will make a note on your account right now indicating that this charge was disputed and that you did not authorize the Premium Service Package addition. That should help expedite the process when they review it.

Customer: (frustrated) That's not really what I wanted to hear, but... I guess that's how it works.

Agent: I know it's frustrating. If it helps, given your account history and the fact that you've been with us for three years with a clean record, I'd say there's a very good chance they'll approve the credit. They take these things seriously.

Customer: Okay. So what happens now? Do I need to do anything on my end?

Agent: No, you don't need to do anything. I'm putting in the request right now, and the billing team will reach out to you. They'll either call you at the number on file or send you an email. Just keep an eye out for that communication. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that's... that's it. Oh, wait. How do I make sure this doesn't happen again? Like, is there a way to lock my account or something so nobody can just add things without my permission?

Agent: That's actually a great question. So, we do have something called account security settings where you can require a PIN or password verification before any changes are made to your account. I can walk you through setting that up right now if you'd like, or I can add a note to your account to have that enabled. It'll just take a minute or two.

Customer: Yeah, let's do it. Go ahead.

Agent: Perfect. So what I'm going to do is ask you for a four-digit PIN that you'd like to use. This PIN will need to be provided any time someone tries to make changes to your account, whether it's online or over the phone. What PIN would you like to set up?

Customer: Um... how about 7429?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 7429. Let me just confirm that—that's 7-4-2-9, correct?

Customer: Yep, that's it.

Agent: Excellent. I've got that set up for you now. You should receive an email confirmation of that change as well. Going forward, anyone trying to modify your account will need to provide that PIN.

Customer: Great. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think we're good. I appreciate your help, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and again, you should hear from our billing team within 24 to 48 hours regarding that credit. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
