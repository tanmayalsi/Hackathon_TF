Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that wasn't there last month. My bill went up like thirty dollars and I want to know what that's about.

Agent: I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my landline number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And can I get your name please?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account here. Let me just take a look at your recent charges. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing your bill from last month was $89.99, and this month it's showing as $119.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, that's exactly it. Thirty bucks just added on. I haven't changed anything with my service. I'm still on the same plan—the 300 megabit fiber package. So what's the deal?

Agent: I completely understand your concern, James. Let me see here... (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at what changed. It looks like your promotional rate expired. You were on a promotional pricing of $89.99 for the first twelve months, and that period has now ended. So you're moving to our standard rate of $119.99 per month for that same service level.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. I was never told about this. I mean, I would've remembered something like that. A promotional rate? That doesn't sound right.

Agent: I understand how that can be frustrating. These promotional periods are typically outlined in the initial paperwork when you sign up for service, but I totally get that it can slip your mind. Let me see when you started service with us. (pause) Looks like you've been a customer since... January of last year. So yes, that twelve-month promotional period would have ended in January of this year.

Customer: (frustrated) Okay, so you guys just let the price jump without really, you know, giving me a heads up? I didn't get any kind of notice or call or anything.

Agent: I hear you on that, James. We do typically send a notice about thirty days before a promotional rate expires, but I can definitely understand if that got lost or overlooked. That happens sometimes. The good news is that I can absolutely help you out here. We do have some options available.

Customer: Okay, what kind of options?

Agent: Well, first, let me see what we can do for you as a valued customer. (typing sounds) I'm looking at what promotions I can apply to your account. How long have you been thinking about keeping the service with us?

Customer: I mean, I like the internet. The speed is good. I don't really want to switch or anything. But thirty dollars more a month is... that's substantial. That's like almost four hundred bucks a year, you know?

Agent: Absolutely, I completely understand. That's a significant amount. Let me see what I can do. (pause) Okay, so I do have the ability to offer you a one-year promotional rate. I can bring your rate back down to $99.99 per month for the next twelve months. That would save you about twenty dollars a month compared to the standard rate. How does that sound?

Customer: So it's still more than the $89.99 I was paying, but it's better than $119.99?

Agent: That's correct, yes. So you'd be looking at $99.99 for the next year, and then after that promotional period ends, it would go to the standard rate of $119.99 unless we find another option for you at that time.

Customer: (hesitant) Hmm. I mean, that's not ideal because I'm still paying more than I was originally, but... I guess that's better than an extra thirty bucks, right? But can't you do better than that?

Agent: That's a fair question. Let me see what else might be available. (typing sounds, longer pause) You know what, James? I'm going to go ahead and extend that same promotional rate—the $99.99—but I'm going to make it for two years instead of one. That way you get a little more stability with your bill going forward. How's that?

Customer: (pause) Two years at $99.99?

Agent: That's right. You'd be locked in at $99.99 per month for the next twenty-four months. So you're only paying an extra ten dollars more than your original promotional rate, and you don't have to worry about any changes for two full years.

Customer: (softening) Okay, yeah. That's... that's actually pretty reasonable. I can work with that. But will I get something in writing about this? I don't want to have the same issue happen in two years.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to make a note on your account right now about this promotion, and you'll receive a confirmation email at the address we have on file. We'll also send you a notice about sixty days before this promotion expires so you're not caught off guard again. Fair?

Customer: Yeah, okay. That's fair. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome, James. Let me just get this all set up for you here. (typing sounds) Okay, I've applied the two-year promotional rate to your account. You should see that reflected on your next bill. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: My pleasure, James. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your loyalty. If you have any issues with your service or need anything else in the future, please don't hesitate to give us a call.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you, and you have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
