Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I just got my bill and I'm looking at a charge that wasn't there before, and I'm pretty confused about it.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got you here. I'm looking at your account now. So you're seeing a charge that's new to you?

Customer: Yeah, on my last bill. I've been with Frontier for, I don't know, like three years now? And my bill has always been $79.99 a month for the 500 meg fiber service. But this month it's showing $109.99. That's like a thirty dollar jump out of nowhere.

Agent: (pause) I understand that's frustrating, James. Let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate did expire at the end of last month. You were on a promotional price for the first twelve months of service, and that looks like it ended.

Customer: Wait, what? I mean... nobody told me about this. I didn't get any notice or anything about my rate going up.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check the account notes here. (pause) It looks like we did send out a notification about thirty days before the promotional period ended. It would have come via email and also as a paper notice in your billing statement from two months ago.

Customer: I mean, I get a lot of emails, you know? I might have missed it. But I'm just saying, a thirty dollar increase seems like a lot. That's almost forty percent more than what I was paying.

Agent: You're right, and I hear you. That is a significant increase. So right now, you're on our standard rate for the 500 megabit fiber service, which is the $109.99 that you're seeing. However, I do have some options that might help.

Customer: Okay, what kind of options?

Agent: Well, first of all, since you've been a customer for three years and you've maintained a good account with us, I could potentially offer you a new promotional rate. I can put you on a twelve-month promotion at $84.99 per month for the same 500 meg service. That would bring your bill down from the $109.99.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so that's better than what I'm paying now, but it's still five dollars more than what I was paying before.

Agent: Right, yes. The second promotion is lower than the standard rate, but it is higher than your original promotional rate. Unfortunately, I'm not able to match that original first-time customer promotion. However, there is another option—we have a 300 megabit tier that's currently available at $69.99 for the first year. Would that be something you'd be interested in?

Customer: How much slower is that, really? I mean, I have the 500 meg now. Would I notice a difference?

Agent: That's a good question. For most everyday use—streaming, browsing, video calls, that kind of thing—300 megs is actually more than sufficient. Most people don't really notice a difference unless they're downloading large files constantly or if you have a lot of devices connected at the same time.

Customer: Hmm. I mean, I don't really do that much. It's just me and my wife watching Netflix and checking email. We're not gamers or anything.

Agent: In that case, honestly, I think the 300 meg service would work great for you, and it would save you some money. You'd be at $69.99 for the first year, and then after that, the rate would go to the standard rate for that tier, which is $89.99.

Customer: (pause) So I'd save money for a year, but then it goes back up anyway?

Agent: Right, so after the first twelve months, it would move to the standard rate of $89.99. But you know, you could always call us back at that point, and we could look at other options. And honestly, promotional rates do become available from time to time.

Customer: Okay, but like, I'm not thrilled about this situation to begin with. Why would I downgrade and then just accept another rate hike in a year?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, James. And I appreciate you bringing this up. Let me see what else I can do here. (pause, typing sounds) You know what, let me talk to my supervisor real quick. Can I put you on a brief hold?

Customer: Sure, I guess.

Agent: I appreciate that. I'll be right back.

(hold music, approximately 40 seconds)

Agent: James? Thanks for holding. Okay, so I was able to speak with my supervisor, and because of your tenure with us and your good payment history, we can actually extend the 84.99 rate I mentioned for an additional six months beyond the standard twelve-month promotion. So that would be eighteen months at $84.99 instead of the $109.99. After that eighteen-month period, if you want to give us a call back, we can revisit promotions again.

Customer: (pause) Eighteen months?

Agent: Yes, eighteen months at $84.99. So you'd still be getting that benefit, and you'd have more time before you'd see another rate change. This is keeping you on the same 500 megabit service you have now.

Customer: Okay, well... that's better. That's actually pretty reasonable. (pause) I mean, I'm still not happy about the whole situation, but at least I can lock that in for a year and a half.

Agent: I'm glad that works better for you. And I really do apologize that we didn't communicate the rate change as clearly as we should have. I'm going to make a note on your account here that you had a billing concern, just so if you call back in the future, we can see that we've made this adjustment for you.

Customer: Okay, yeah. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: Of course, James. So let me just confirm everything here. You'll remain on the 500 megabit fiber service, and your rate will be $84.99 per month for the next eighteen months, starting with your next billing cycle. You should see that reflected on your next statement.

Customer: Got it. How long does that take to show up?

Agent: Your next billing cycle should process within the next five to seven business days, and you'll see the new rate on that bill.

Customer: Alright, sounds good.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications, and thanks for being a loyal customer. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
