Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I noticed my internet bill went up like... a lot. It jumped from $79.99 to $119.99. I don't understand why, and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm so sorry you're experiencing that frustration. I completely understand. Let me pull up your account here and take a look. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, got it here. Okay, so I'm looking at your account for... Sarah Martinez, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So I can see your bill here, and I do see that increase. Let me explain what happened. So you were on our promotional rate of $79.99 per month for the first year, and that promotional period ended on your last billing cycle. Your new rate is our standard rate, which is $119.99 for the 500 Mbps fiber plan you're subscribed to.

Customer: But nobody told me about this. I mean, I didn't see anything in my bill about the promotion ending or anything like that. This is... I've been a customer for over three years now.

Agent: I hear you, and I really appreciate your loyalty. Let me check here... (pause, typing sounds) So I'm seeing that we did send out a notification about 30 days prior to the rate change. It should have come either through email or mail, depending on your preference. Do you remember receiving anything like that?

Customer: I don't think so? I mean, maybe it went to spam or something. But still, that's almost a 50% increase. That seems really steep.

Agent: You know what, that's a fair point, and I appreciate you bringing that to my attention. I completely understand your concern with that kind of increase. Here's what I can do for you. I can apply a loyalty discount that we have available. It's typically for customers like yourself who have been with us for multiple years. Let me see what I can get approved here.

Customer: Okay... (pause) Yeah, that would be helpful.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm looking at a few options here. I can get you a discount that would bring your rate down to $99.99 for the next 12 months. How does that sound?

Customer: So it's still going up $20 a month from where I was.

Agent: Yes, I understand. Unfortunately, the promotional rate is something that's only available to new customers, but I can definitely get you the loyalty pricing, which keeps you closer to where you were before. And after the 12 months, we can revisit this again to see if there are any other offers available at that time.

Customer: Hmm. And that's the best you can do?

Agent: Let me see if I can... (pause, typing sounds) you know what, let me try one more thing here. Because you've been such a great customer, I'm going to add an additional $5 courtesy credit to your next bill. So that would bring your effective rate to $94.99 for the next 12 months. Does that help make it more manageable?

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I mean... it's better. It's still not ideal, but I appreciate it. I guess I can work with that.

Agent: Great, I really appreciate your understanding. Let me just confirm all these changes here. (typing sounds) So I'm putting a note on your account right now, approving the loyalty rate of $99.99 per month for the next 12 months, plus a $5 bill credit to be applied to your next statement. So your next bill should reflect these changes.

Customer: Okay, great. How long is that going to take to show up?

Agent: Your next billing cycle typically updates within 24 to 48 hours, but you should definitely see it reflected on your next statement, which will be generated on the same date as usual. And you should get that either via email or mail, whichever you have set up.

Customer: Alright, and just to clarify—after the 12 months, it's going to go back up to $119.99 unless I call back?

Agent: Exactly right. So what I'd recommend is just make a note on your calendar for about a month before that expires, so you can give us a call and we can work out another option at that time. Hopefully, we'll have something available for you then as well.

Customer: Okay, okay. That makes sense. Well, I appreciate your help, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
