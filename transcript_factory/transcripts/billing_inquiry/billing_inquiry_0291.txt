# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize. I was told my rate was locked in, and now it's gone up like thirty dollars.

Agent: I understand your frustration. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, it's 555-0847. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. One moment, please.

(pause)

Agent: Perfect, I've got your account right here. Name on the account is Michael?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. So you're saying you're seeing a price increase on your current bill? Let me take a look at your billing history here... Okay, I'm seeing your account. Can you tell me what you're being charged this month?

Customer: It says $89.99 for my internet service. Last month it was like $59.99. That's a thirty-dollar jump, man. I mean, that's not... that's not nothing, you know?

Agent: I totally understand. That is a significant increase. Let me check your service plan and any promotional pricing you might have had. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account, and it looks like you had a promotional rate that was... let me see here... that was set to expire on March 1st. Is that around when you saw this increase?

Customer: Yeah, I think... I mean, I wasn't really paying attention to dates, but that sounds about right. The bill came through like a week and a half ago.

Agent: Right, so what happened is your promotional pricing—you had a 12-month promo rate at $59.99 a month for our Gigabit fiber service—and that promotional period ended on March 1st. When those promos expire, the rate does go back to our standard pricing.

Customer: Well, nobody told me about that. I mean, I remember signing up for it, but... I didn't know there was an expiration date. I thought it was locked in. That's what the sales guy said.

Agent: I hear you. (pause) Unfortunately, the promotional rates do have an end date, and it should have been communicated to you when you signed up. I apologize if that wasn't clear. Let me see what I can do to help you here. Are you still satisfied with the service itself? No issues with speeds or connectivity?

Customer: No, no, the service has been great. I'm not complaining about the service. It's just... I can't afford to pay ninety dollars a month. I'm on a budget here.

Agent: Completely understood. Let me look at what options we have available for you right now. (typing sounds) So looking at current promotions, I can offer you... actually, you know what, because you've been such a good customer—I'm seeing you've had this account for over a year now with no late payments—I can put you on a customer loyalty rate. I can get you back down to $69.99 a month for the next 12 months. That's still higher than your promotional rate, but it's better than the standard $89.99.

Customer: So you're saying that's the best you can do?

Agent: That's the best I can do as a standard agent, yeah. But let me be honest with you—you could also call our loyalty department directly, and sometimes they have additional options available that I don't have access to. That said, the $69.99 is a solid rate. That gives you a twenty-dollar savings right there compared to what you're paying now.

Customer: (pause) I mean... that's better, I guess. But it still feels like I'm being punished for being a customer. You know?

Agent: I completely get that frustration, and I genuinely apologize. You're right—it doesn't feel great. The thing is, we do need to offer promotional rates to attract new customers, and unfortunately, those can't last forever. But your loyalty does matter to us, which is why I'm offering you this rate. And then in a year, we can talk about renewing again.

Customer: Okay, fine. Yeah, let's do the $69.99. Will that kick in on my next bill?

Agent: It will. Let me process this change for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, and I'm gonna need you to verify something for security purposes. What's the last four digits of the Social Security number on the account?

Customer: [inaudible] 4782.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) And just to confirm, your billing address is still 847 Maple Drive in Bozeman?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. (typing sounds) Okay, I've successfully applied the customer loyalty rate of $69.99 per month to your account, effective immediately. That means this new rate will show on your next billing cycle, which would be... let me see... April 3rd. You should receive an updated bill showing the new rate.

Customer: Okay. And it's locked in for a year, right?

Agent: Yes, exactly. This rate is good through March 1st of next year, and then we can discuss options again at that time. You'll actually receive a notification around 30 days before the expiration so you're not surprised again.

Customer: (pause) Alright. I appreciate that, Derek. And sorry for... I mean, I wasn't trying to be difficult.

Agent: No apologies necessary at all. You have every right to question your bill, and I'm glad we could work something out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: Nope, that's it. Thank you.

Agent: Great. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, Michael. We really do appreciate your business. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
