# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm really frustrated with my bill. I got my statement yesterday and my internet bill went up like thirty dollars. I wasn't notified about this or anything.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, that's the service address in Portland, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Alright, I'm seeing your account here. So you're saying you received a price increase? Let me just look at your recent billing history. (typing sounds) Okay, I see what happened here. Can you tell me what your bill was before, what you're expecting it to be?

Customer: Well, before it was like... I think around $79 a month? And now this month it's showing $109. That's almost a forty dollar difference, not thirty. I don't understand why nobody called me.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. That is a significant increase. Let me explain what I'm seeing here. It looks like you've been on our promotional pricing for, um... (pause) ...for about twelve months now. Your promotional period expired at the end of last month, so your account automatically transitioned to our standard rate for your service tier.

Customer: Wait, what? I never agreed to a promotional thing. I've been paying that amount since I signed up.

Agent: I hear you. So, you may not remember, but typically when you first sign up, we do provide promotional pricing for the first year. It should have been in your welcome materials and on your contract. However, I completely understand if you didn't see that. Um, have you had a chance to look at your bill itself? We do send notifications.

Customer: I get so many emails, honestly. I probably deleted it or it went to spam or something. But that's not really my fault, you know? I was happy with my service and my price. Can't you just keep me at the lower rate?

Agent: I definitely understand, and I appreciate you being patient with me while I look into this. (typing sounds) So, I have a couple of options for you. First, I want to let you know that we do have some other promotions available right now. However, since you've been such a good customer—I'm seeing no late payments, no service issues—I can potentially offer you a retention discount.

Customer: Okay... like what?

Agent: So, I can reduce your rate by $15 per month for the next twelve months. That would bring you down to $94 instead of $109. It won't be back to your original promotional price, but it's a significant savings.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. I mean, I guess that's better than a hundred and nine, but... I'm kind of annoyed that I wasn't really made aware this was coming. Like, is there any way to get it back to the original price?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Unfortunately, the promotional pricing does expire after the first twelve months, so we can't go all the way back to that rate. However, let me see if there's anything else I can do here. (typing sounds) Actually, you know what, I'm going to see if I can add an additional $5 credit to your account as a courtesy for the inconvenience of not receiving adequate notification. That would bring your rate to $89 per month for the next year, which is only $10 more than you were paying before.

Customer: Well, okay. That's... that's a little better. How long does this rate hold for?

Agent: So the $15 monthly discount will apply for twelve months from today. After that, if you don't reach back out to us, you would go back to the standard rate of $109. I would definitely recommend calling us around month eleven to discuss renewal options at that time.

Customer: Alright, yeah, I can do that. So just to be clear, my bill next month will be $89?

Agent: Exactly. $89 per month. That discount will start on your next billing cycle, which looks like it's gonna be in about four days. You should see it reflected on your next statement.

Customer: Okay. And the credit I'm getting, is that applied to my account now?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, actually, I'm applying that $5 credit to your account right now as we speak. You may see that reflected in your next billing statement as well. Can I ask, is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I think that covers it. I still wish I'd gotten a better heads-up, but I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: I really do appreciate your patience, and I genuinely apologize for the confusion with the notification. We'll definitely make sure you're aware before this promotional period ends next year. Do you have any questions about your service itself? Everything working okay with your internet speed?

Customer: Actually, no, the service has been great. No complaints there.

Agent: Excellent. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I'm glad I could help resolve this for you. If you need anything in the future, just give us a call. Your confirmation number for this call is 8847-X. Do you need me to repeat that?

Customer: No, I got it. 8847-X. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now!
