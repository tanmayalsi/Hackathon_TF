Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually, I do recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it, and I think there's been some kind of mistake.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Patterson. P-A-T-T-E-R-S-O-N.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, James, I'm pulling up your account now. Just one moment... Alright, I've got you here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan in the Scottsdale area. What charge are you concerned about?

Customer: Well, it's this... it says here "Service Plan Adjustment – $15.00." I've never seen that before. My bill was $89.99 last month, and this month it jumped to $104.99. That's a fifteen-dollar increase, and I want to know why nobody told me about it.

Agent: (pause) I understand your frustration. Let me look into that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that adjustment was applied on the 15th of this month. It looks like your promotional pricing expired. You had a twelve-month promotional rate that was set to end, and once that ended, your plan went to the standard pricing for the Fiber 500 tier.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. Promotional rate? I was never told there was a promotional rate. I've had this service for... I don't know, like two years now. And nobody sent me anything saying my rate was going to go up.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check what documentation we have in your file. (typing sounds) It shows here that when you signed up two years ago, you were enrolled in our standard Fiber 500 promotion, which was twelve months at the introductory rate of $89.99. After that period, the rate adjusts to our standard rate of $104.99. 

Customer: Okay, but that was two years ago. The promo should have ended after twelve months, not two years later. So either something got extended without me knowing, or... I don't know, this doesn't make sense.

Agent: That's a really good question, and I can see why you'd be confused. Let me pull up your account notes here. (typing sounds) Ah, okay, so it looks like the promotional pricing was actually extended. We have a note here from about a year ago saying that a previous representative extended your promotional rate for an additional twelve months as a courtesy. So it looks like that second promotional period just ended on the 15th.

Customer: (pause) Well, that's... I mean, I didn't ask for it to be extended. And if it was extended, shouldn't someone have called me or sent me a letter telling me when it was going to end again?

Agent: You know, that's a fair point. Ideally, we should have sent you a notification before the adjustment took effect. I sincerely apologize that didn't happen. But I do want to make sure I'm understanding correctly – you received no notification at all about this?

Customer: Not that I saw. Maybe something came in the mail that I threw away, but... I don't think I got anything. And I definitely didn't get an email or a call.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what I can do to help you out here. I'm going to make a note on your account. First of all, I can apply a credit for this month – let's go back to your promotional rate of $89.99 – to make up for not having proper notification.

Customer: Really? Okay, well, that's... that's good. I appreciate that.

Agent: Yes, of course. But I also want to be transparent with you about what happens going forward. After I apply this adjustment, your rate will revert to the standard $104.99 per month, effective next billing cycle. However, I do have the ability to offer you a new promotional rate if you're interested in keeping us as your provider.

Customer: Well, what kind of promotional rate are we talking about?

Agent: (pause) I can offer you six months at $79.99 per month if you commit to staying with us for the next year. Or if you prefer, I can apply a loyalty discount that would bring your standard rate down to $94.99 per month with no contract required. Which sounds more appealing to you?

Customer: Hmm... (pause) I mean, I like the Frontier service. The internet has been really fast and reliable. But I feel like I'm getting... I don't know, like I'm being played around with here. First I get a surprise bill increase, and now you're offering me discounts?

Agent: I completely understand why you'd feel that way, and I don't blame you. What I can tell you is that these promotional offers are legitimate ways we work with our customers to keep them happy and offer good value. But you're right – we should have communicated better about your rate adjustment. That's on us, and I apologize for that.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Let me think about this. Can I call back if I want to take you up on one of those offers?

Agent: Absolutely. You can call back anytime, or if you prefer, I can go ahead and apply one of these offers right now. Either way is fine.

Customer: No, I think I'll just... I'll think about it. But I appreciate the credit for this month. So my bill next month should be back to $89.99, right?

Agent: That's correct. Your bill for this cycle will be $89.99, and I've made a note on your account about the promotional adjustment. Now, regarding future billing, I do want to set proper expectations. Starting next month, unless you select one of the promotional offers I mentioned, your rate will be $104.99.

Customer: Yeah, I heard you. I'll give you a call next week if I want to do one of those deals.

Agent: That sounds perfect. And James, just to make sure – is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
