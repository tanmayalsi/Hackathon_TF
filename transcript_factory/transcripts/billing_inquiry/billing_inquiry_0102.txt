Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So I got my bill yesterday and I'm looking at it right now, and there's a charge on here that I definitely didn't authorize. I need to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having an issue with your bill. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And just to confirm, is this for the service at 842 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And what specifically are you seeing on your bill that you'd like to dispute?

Customer: Well, my bill was $79.99 a month when I signed up six months ago, right? For the gigabit internet package. And now this month it jumped to $109.99. That's like a thirty dollar increase! Nobody called me about this, nobody sent me a letter... I just got this bill and boom, there it is.

Agent: I understand how frustrating that must be. (pause) Let me take a look at your account history here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate of $79.99 did expire. That was a six-month introductory offer, and it looks like it ended at the end of last month.

Customer: A promotional rate? Nobody told me it was promotional. You guys said it was $79.99 a month when I signed up. I wouldn't have agreed to that if I knew it was temporary.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me check your account notes... (pause) Okay, so according to what's here, the promotional terms should have been outlined in the welcome packet that was sent with your installation materials.

Customer: Well, I didn't read all that fine print, but I also didn't authorize a thirty-dollar increase. That's crazy. Your competitor down the street offers gigabit for like $99 a month, and they don't pull this bait-and-switch stuff.

Agent: I hear you. And I apologize that the promotional expiration wasn't more clearly communicated to you. Let me see what I can do to help. (typing sounds) So your regular rate for the gigabit package is $109.99 per month, which is what you're seeing now. However, I do have the ability to offer you some options here.

Customer: Okay, what kind of options?

Agent: Well, first of all, I can apply a loyalty credit to your account for the next three months. That would bring your rate down to $94.99 for those three months. After that, we'd go back to the regular rate of $109.99, unless we can work something else out at that time.

Customer: Three months? And then what, it jumps back up again and I have to call back and complain?

Agent: That's a fair point. (pause) Let me see... I can actually do better than that. We have a current promotion running right now where I can lock in a rate of $99.99 per month for the gigabit package for a full year. That's a $10 increase from your promotional rate, but it's significantly better than the $109.99, and it gives you price stability for the next twelve months.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so $99.99 for a year. Is that guaranteed? Like, you're not going to surprise me with another increase halfway through?

Agent: That's correct. That rate is locked in for twelve months from today. You won't see any increases during that period unless you make changes to your service yourself.

Customer: Alright, I can work with that. But I want to make sure—is there anything else on this bill I should know about? Any hidden fees or anything?

Agent: Let me review your account... (typing sounds) No, you're good. You have just the internet service, no TV or phone bundle, so it's just the gigabit internet at $99.99 per month. There are no equipment fees, no modem rental charges. That's your all-in rate.

Customer: Good. And what about this month? My bill says $109.99 for this period.

Agent: Right, so that charge is for this current billing cycle. Since we're changing your rate effective today, that adjustment will be reflected on your next bill, which would be next month. Your next bill will be $99.99 instead of the $109.99.

Customer: So I'm still stuck with paying the $109.99 for this month?

Agent: (pause) I understand that's not ideal. Let me see if I can get that adjusted for you as a one-time courtesy. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to add a $10 credit to your account, which will bring this month's charge down to $99.99 as well. How does that sound?

Customer: Yeah, that's... that's actually pretty fair. I appreciate that.

Agent: Great. I'm glad I could help. So just to recap what we've done here: I've applied a one-time $10 credit to your current bill, bringing this month's charge to $99.99. And I've enrolled you in a locked-in rate of $99.99 per month for the next twelve months, starting with your next billing cycle. That rate is guaranteed, so you won't see any increases.

Customer: Perfect. And I'll get an email or something confirming all this?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to send you an email confirmation right now with all the details of this change, including the new rate and the credit that's been applied. You should see that within the next few minutes.

Customer: Okay, good. I think we're all set then.

Agent: Excellent. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks for taking care of that, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. I appreciate your patience, and thank you for being a Frontier customer. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
