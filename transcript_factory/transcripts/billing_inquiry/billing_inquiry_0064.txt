Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my monthly bill has gone way up. I need to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your bill. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account here. One moment... (pause) Alright, I've got you. Your name is Michael Chen, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize and that your bill has increased. Can you tell me a little bit more about what you're seeing?

Customer: Well, last month I paid $79.99, and this month it's $109.99. That's like thirty bucks more, Derek. And there's a line item that just says "Equipment Fee - $14.99." I don't remember agreeing to any equipment fee.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I understand your frustration. Let me look at your account history here. (pause) So it looks like... yes, your bill did increase. Can you tell me—are you still on the same internet plan you've had?

Customer: As far as I know, yeah. I mean, I signed up for your 500 Mbps plan like two years ago, and I've been paying 79.99 ever since. I haven't changed anything.

Agent: Right. And when did you receive this bill?

Customer: It came in the mail yesterday. So this is for service starting the 15th of this month.

Agent: (typing) Okay, so this is your February bill. Let me... I'm checking when any changes were made to your account. (pause) Alright, so I see here that on January 28th, there was a plan adjustment. Do you remember receiving any notification about a rate change?

Customer: No. No, I didn't get anything. Or maybe... I get a lot of emails. But I definitely didn't agree to this. What adjustment? Why would my plan change?

Agent: I apologize. Let me explain what I'm seeing. It appears that your introductory rate period expired at the end of January. You had a promotional rate of $79.99 for the first 24 months, and that term has now ended. The standard rate for our 500 Mbps Fiber plan is currently $109.99 per month.

Customer: (sighs) So you're telling me you just raised my rate by thirty dollars without asking me?

Agent: I understand why that's frustrating, and I apologize. Typically customers do receive a notification about rate changes 30 days before they take effect. Let me pull up your communications here to see what was sent. (pause) Okay, so it looks like we sent you an email on... December 28th, notifying you about the upcoming rate change.

Customer: I'm telling you, I didn't see that email. And honestly, that's not really the point. You should have to actively let me know before you raise my bill, not just send an email hoping I see it. That's not fair.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I genuinely understand your perspective. These notifications can sometimes get lost in email filters, and I apologize for that. Now, regarding that $14.99 equipment fee—that's for the fiber modem we provided when we installed your service. That fee has always been there, but let me check... (typing sounds) Actually, you know what, it looks like that was waived for the first 24 months as part of your promotional package. So now that your promo period is over, that fee is showing up.

Customer: So you waived it for two years and now I have to pay it? That doesn't seem right either.

Agent: I hear you. I completely understand. So the increase is really due to the expiration of your promotional pricing. What I can do for you, Michael, is explore some options. First, I can check if there are any current promotions or loyalty discounts I can apply to bring your rate back down. Let me do that for you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so we do have a loyalty offer available for existing customers. I can offer you a rate of $89.99 per month on your 500 Mbps plan for the next 12 months, which would include the equipment fee waived. That would be lower than both your original rate and the current standard rate.

Customer: (pause) So that's $89.99 instead of $109.99?

Agent: That's correct, yes.

Customer: (pause) Well... I mean, that's better. But I'm still paying more than I was before. I was at $79.99.

Agent: I completely understand, and I wish I could get you back to that exact rate. Unfortunately, the $79.99 was specifically promotional pricing that came with a 24-month commitment. However, the $89.99 offer is the best rate I have available right now for a loyal customer in your situation. That does bring you back closer to where you were, and it does waive the equipment fee.

Customer: (sighs) Can you do anything else? Like, I've been a customer for over two years. That should mean something.

Agent: (pause) I really do appreciate your loyalty, Michael. Let me see what else I can do here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I can also add a $10 monthly credit to your account for the next three months as a courtesy, given your concerns about the rate change and the notification issue. So combined with the $89.99 rate and the waived equipment fee, that would bring your first three months to $79.99, which matches your original rate. Then after that, you'd be at $89.99.

Customer: (pause) Okay... so for three months it's back to what I was paying, and then it goes to $89.99?

Agent: That's exactly right. And just to be clear, the $14.99 equipment fee would be waived the entire time as well.

Customer: (pause) Alright. I guess that works. But I want to make sure—are you sure this is going to be reflected on my next bill?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me just confirm all of this on your account right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I've applied the $89.99 loyalty rate, effective immediately. I've also waived the equipment fee, and I've added a $10 monthly courtesy credit for the next three months. You should see all of this reflected on your next bill. You'll actually see a credit applied as well to account for the overcharge on this month's bill.

Customer: (pause) Okay. That's... actually pretty good. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. And again, I apologize for the frustration this caused. Going forward, if you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
