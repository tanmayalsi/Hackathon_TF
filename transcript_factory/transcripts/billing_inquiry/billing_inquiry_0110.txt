# Frontier Communications - Billing Dispute Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I got my statement yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, the price went up again. I'm pretty frustrated.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you're frustrated. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I've got your account for Sarah Mitchell at 4256 Birch Lane, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned a charge you don't recognize and also a price increase. Let's start with the unrecognized charge. Can you tell me which charge is standing out to you on your bill?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill this month is $127.50, right? And last month it was $89.99. That's almost a forty dollar jump. And then there's this line item for... (pause) "Equipment Protection Plan" for $9.99. I definitely did not sign up for that.

Agent: Okay, I'm seeing that. Let me take a look at your account here. (typing sounds) So I can see the Equipment Protection Plan was added to your account on... March 15th. Do you recall anyone contacting you about that, or perhaps you signed up during a service call?

Customer: No, absolutely not. I wouldn't just add something I don't need. This is the first I'm hearing about it. That needs to come off.

Agent: I hear you, and I can definitely take care of removing that for you. That won't be a problem at all. I'm going to note here that this was added without your authorization. (typing sounds) Okay, that's been removed as of today, so your next bill won't include that charge. And I can actually credit your account for this month's $9.99 since it was applied without your consent.

Customer: Thank you. Okay, that helps, but what about the rest of the increase? That's still like thirty dollars more than I was paying.

Agent: (pause) Let me look into that for you. Can you tell me what service plan you were on previously? Was it our standard Gig plan or the Hyper Gig?

Customer: I think it's just the regular one. I don't need the super fast speeds. I use it for email and streaming and stuff. Nothing crazy.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history here, and it looks like you were on our Fiber 200 plan at $79.99 a month. And currently, you're on the Fiber Gig plan at $119.99 a month. So that would explain the increase you're seeing. Do you remember when that change was made?

Customer: Wait, I'm on the Gig plan? I never asked for that. How did that happen?

Agent: I can see here that it was added on March 10th... Let me check the notes... (pause) It shows here that it was added during a service call for a modem replacement. The technician may have upgraded your plan at that time.

Customer: (frustrated) No one asked me if I wanted that. I didn't authorize that either. I want to go back to what I had before. This is ridiculous.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize. That should have required your explicit approval before making any changes. I'm going to go ahead and downgrade you back to the Fiber 200 plan, which will bring your rate back to $79.99. 

Customer: Okay, thank you. And what about the difference I already paid?

Agent: (typing sounds) Great question. Let me calculate that... So you were charged the higher rate for approximately two weeks. That's about $14 in overages. I'm going to go ahead and credit that to your account as well along with the Equipment Protection Plan charge.

Customer: Okay, so I'll get about $24 credited back?

Agent: That's correct. You'll see both credits applied to your next billing cycle, which should bring your balance down significantly. Your new recurring charge going forward will be $79.99 per month for the Fiber 200 plan.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. But I have to say, I'm not thrilled about how this happened in the first place. It feels like someone's just making changes to my account without asking.

Agent: You know, I completely agree with you, and I take that feedback seriously. This shouldn't have happened. We pride ourselves on transparency with our customers, and clearly we fell short here. I'm going to be adding a note to your account that you prefer not to have any plan changes made without prior written or verbal confirmation directly from you. That way, our team will know to call and confirm with you first.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's... that's good. I appreciate that.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your bill or your service?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Just, uh, just make sure those credits show up like you said.

Agent: Absolutely, they will. You should see them on your next billing statement within the next 7 to 10 days. And again, I sincerely apologize for the confusion and the unauthorized charges. Is there a number I can reach you at if there are any issues with those credits being applied?

Customer: It's the same number on the account.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I appreciate you giving us the opportunity to make this right. You have a great day.

Customer: Yeah, you too. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you. Goodbye.
