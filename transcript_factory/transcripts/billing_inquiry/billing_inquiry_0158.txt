# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge that I don't think I should be paying. It's gone up significantly.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account. Can I get your phone number or account number, please?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing an account here under the name... is this Patricia Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, the service address is 412 Maple Street, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned there's a charge you're concerned about. Can you tell me which charge is bothering you, or is it the overall bill amount?

Customer: Well, both, kind of. My bill went from like $89.99 to $119.99. That's a thirty dollar jump, and I don't understand why. I haven't added any services or anything.

Agent: I understand your frustration. That is a noticeable increase. Let me take a look at what's happening here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account, and I can see that you were on our promotional pricing for the first 12 months. You've been with us for... just over a year now, correct?

Customer: Yeah, I signed up last summer. But nobody told me my bill was going to jump up like this. The promotional price should've lasted longer than this.

Agent: I completely understand why you'd feel that way. These promotional periods typically do have a set timeframe, and it should've been outlined in your service agreement. Let me look at the details here. (typing sounds) It looks like your promotion was for 12 months, and it ended last month, so you're now at our standard pricing for your plan.

Customer: But that seems really unfair. I mean, $30 more a month? That's a huge increase. Can you explain what I'm actually paying for at that price?

Agent: Of course. You're on our Fiber 200 plan, which includes download speeds up to 200 megabits per second, unlimited data, and our basic TV package with about 140 channels. At the promotional rate, that was $89.99, but our standard rate for that same package is $119.99 per month.

Customer: I don't even use the TV package that much. Can't I downgrade or something? Or is there any way to reduce this?

Agent: (pause) That's actually a great question. Let me see what options we have available. Are you still interested in keeping your internet service with us?

Customer: Well, I'd like to, but not at this price. It's ridiculous.

Agent: Absolutely. So here's what I can do for you. We do have some options that might help. First, if you're open to it, I could look at downgrading you from the TV package. That would save you about $15 a month. Or... (pause, typing sounds) I'm actually seeing that we have a customer retention offer available on your account. I could extend you another promotional rate for 12 months at $94.99 for the Fiber 200 with TV included.

Customer: Really? Where was that option before? Why didn't anyone mention it to me when I called about this?

Agent: I appreciate your frustration. These offers typically come up when there's a billing concern or a churn risk, and they're stored in our system for customer service to access. I apologize that this wasn't proactively communicated to you. But I can definitely apply this for you right now if you'd like.

Customer: Okay, well... I mean, that's better than $119.99. But it's still more than what I was paying before.

Agent: I understand. And I want to be transparent with you – when this 12-month promotion expires again, you would go back to the standard rate. However, I could also make a note on your account that you'd like us to reach out before that happens, so we can discuss options with you ahead of time rather than having this surprise again.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I appreciate that. And you said I could downgrade from TV too?

Agent: Yes, we could do that as well. If you drop the TV package, you'd be looking at around $54.99 for just the Fiber 200 internet plan. So it depends on whether you watch the TV service or not.

Customer: Hmm. Well, my kids watch some of it, so... I guess I'll keep it. So you're saying you can do the $94.99 rate for another year?

Agent: Exactly. The $94.99 promotional rate for 12 months. And I'll add a note here (typing sounds) that we should proactively reach out to you before it expires so we can discuss your options.

Customer: Okay, I think that's fair. But I have to say, I wish this had been communicated better from the start.

Agent: I completely agree, and I really do apologize for that. I'm going to go ahead and apply this promotional rate to your account right now. It will take effect on your next billing cycle, which should be... (pause) that would be on the 15th of next month.

Customer: Okay, when will I see the adjustment on this month's bill?

Agent: This month's bill – since you already received that – that'll stay at $119.99. But starting next month, it will show up as $94.99.

Customer: Alright. And you're going to put that note on my account about calling me next year?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. (typing sounds) I'm putting it right here in the notes. Someone from our team will reach out to you around November to discuss your options before your promotion expires.

Customer: Okay, that's good. Thank you for doing that. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I'm glad this got resolved.

Agent: Wonderful. Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and I'm sorry again about the confusion with the rate increase. We'll be in touch next year. Is there a best number to reach you at?

Customer: Um, the number I called in on should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. I have that as 555-0147. That's all set. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
