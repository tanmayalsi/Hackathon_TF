# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and something doesn't look right.

Agent: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number. Well, actually that might be my phone number. Hold on, let me... okay, the account number is 8847-2291.

Agent: (typing sounds) Great, thank you. I'm pulling that up now. And what's the best name to address you by?

Customer: It's Rebecca. Rebecca Martinez.

Agent: Perfect, Rebecca. I have your account here. I see you're on our Gig Fiber 1000 plan. What seems to be the issue with your bill today?

Customer: Okay, so I've been with Frontier for about three years now, and my bill has always been $79.99 a month. That's what I signed up for, you know? But this month my bill came in at $94.99. That's like, fifteen dollars more, and I have no idea why. Did you guys just randomly raise my rates?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Rebecca. Let me take a look at your account history here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing something here. It looks like... you had a promotional rate that was set to expire. Let me pull up the details of your service agreement.

Customer: A promotional rate? I mean... I don't know. I was told when I signed up that it was $79.99 a month.

Agent: Yes, I see what happened here. When you signed up three years ago, you received a promotional rate of $79.99 for the first twelve months. After that, the rate was supposed to adjust to the standard rate of $94.99 per month. However, it looks like our system kept the promotional rate active beyond the promotion period. So this month, it finally adjusted to what it should have been.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me I've been on some kind of... intro rate this whole time? But nobody ever told me that. If I had known that my bill was going to jump up, I would've... I don't know, I would've done something about it.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the confusion. Typically we send out notifications about rate changes, but it seems like this didn't happen in your case. Let me see what I can do for you here.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I mean, I love the service. The internet speed is great, and I haven't had any issues, but I'm on a pretty tight budget, and an extra fifteen dollars a month really adds up.

Agent: (typing sounds) So looking at your options here, Rebecca... I can't reverse the rate increase retroactively, but what I can do is offer you a loyalty promotion. I can apply a $20 discount to your account for the next twelve months. That would actually bring your bill down to $74.99 per month, which is even lower than what you were paying before.

Customer: Really? You can do that?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. It's the least I can do for being a loyal customer for three years. The discount would start on your next billing cycle, and it would be good for the next year. After that, the rate would return to $94.99 unless we have another promotion available at that time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that... that actually sounds really good. I appreciate that. But, um, is there any way I could get an even longer discount, or like, a permanent rate or something?

Agent: That's a great question. Unfortunately, I can only authorize the twelve-month promotion at the $20 discount level. However, if you wanted to lock in a rate for longer, I could transfer you to our retention specialist who might have additional options available. They sometimes have access to different promotional packages.

Customer: How long would that take? I don't really have a ton of time.

Agent: It should only be about five to ten minutes. Would you like me to transfer you?

Customer: (pause) No, actually, I think the twelve-month discount is good. I'll take it. That brings me down to $74.99, right?

Agent: That's correct. $74.99 per month for the next twelve months. And Rebecca, I do want to apologize again for the confusion with the rate change. We should have been more transparent about the promotional period ending.

Customer: Yeah, in the future, maybe you guys could send out an email or something a few weeks before. Just to give people a heads up, you know?

Agent: That's really good feedback, and I'm going to note that on your account. I'll also make a note that this promotion was applied due to the lack of notification about the rate change.

Customer: (typing sounds in background) Great. So when does this take effect?

Agent: This will be effective on your next billing cycle, which... let me check... looks like that would be next Monday. So your bill should reflect the $74.99 amount at that time.

Customer: Perfect. Is there anything else I need to do on my end?

Agent: No, you're all set! The discount is being applied automatically. You should see it on your next bill. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thank you so much for your help, Marcus. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome, Rebecca. Thank you so much for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really appreciate your business. If you need anything else in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Will do. Have a good day!

Agent: You too! Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day.
