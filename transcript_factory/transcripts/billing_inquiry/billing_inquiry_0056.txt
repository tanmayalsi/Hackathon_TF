# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually I do recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it to be this high.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And what's the best name to have on the account?

Customer: It's James Martinez.

Agent: (pause) Okay, James, I've got your account up here. I can see you're on our Gigabit internet plan. Is that the charge you're concerned about?

Customer: Yeah, so... I've been a customer for like three years now, and my bill's always been $79.99. But this month it jumped to $99.99. That's a twenty dollar increase with no warning. Did you guys just raise prices or...?

Agent: I understand your frustration, James. Let me look into what happened here. (typing sounds) So I'm seeing that your promotional rate did expire at the end of last month. You were on our three-year promotion that provided a discount for new customers, and that ended on October 31st.

Customer: Wait, wait. What promotion? I was never told about any promotion expiring. When I signed up, nobody said anything about it being temporary.

Agent: I completely understand. Sometimes these things aren't communicated as clearly as they should be. Looking at your file, the promotion was a three-year locked-in rate that was applied when you first signed up in October 2021. It looks like it ran through October of this year, so now you're at our standard rate, which is $99.99 per month for the Gigabit plan.

Customer: (pause) So you're telling me that was always temporary? Nobody called me or sent me a letter saying "hey, your rate's about to go up." This is the first I'm hearing of it.

Agent: I apologize for that, James. You're right—we should have proactively notified you before that rate ended. That's on us. The good news is I can definitely look at what options we have available for you right now.

Customer: Okay, well... what are my options? Because twenty bucks more a month is a lot. That's like an extra $240 a year for the same service.

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely. So let me see what promotions I can offer you. (pause) I do have a couple of options. I can offer you a six-month promotional rate of $69.99 per month for the Gigabit plan, or I can look at our other service tiers if you wanted to step down to our 500 Meg plan, which would be $59.99 with a twelve-month promotional rate.

Customer: Hold on. The 500 Meg plan? I mean, I mostly use the internet for streaming and work-from-home stuff. Would that be a noticeable difference?

Agent: That's a good question. For most users doing streaming and video conferencing, you probably wouldn't notice a huge difference. The Gigabit is better if you have multiple people on the network at the same time doing bandwidth-heavy activities. Do you live alone or...?

Customer: It's just me and my wife. We both work from home, but not usually at the exact same time. We stream Netflix a lot, and... yeah, mostly that.

Agent: Honestly, the 500 Meg plan would probably work fine for your situation. You'd save ten dollars a month compared to our current Gigabit rate, which would bring you back down to $89.99 after the promotional period ends. Or, if you want to stick with Gigabit and take the six-month promotion, that's $69.99 for six months, and then it would go back up to $99.99 after that.

Customer: (pause) So basically I'm stuck paying $99.99 eventually either way?

Agent: Well, after any promotional period ends, yes, that would be the standard rate. But we do regularly have promotions available, so you could potentially qualify for another one when this one ends. It's not guaranteed, but it's pretty common.

Customer: That's... I mean, that doesn't really help. Look, I've been a good customer for three years. I've never missed a payment. Doesn't loyalty mean anything?

Agent: It definitely should, and I really appreciate your loyalty, James. (pause) Let me see if there's anything else I can do here. (typing sounds) Okay, so what if I could extend that six-month promotional rate to nine months? That would give you a little more breathing room, and you'd be paying $69.99 per month during that time.

Customer: That's better, but... I guess what I'm really frustrated about is the lack of communication. I just feel like I shouldn't have been blindsided like this.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I hear you. Unfortunately, I can't speak to what happened on the notification side of things, but I can make a note on your account about this, and I can also transfer you to our customer service management team if you'd like to provide formal feedback about how this was handled. They review those comments regularly.

Customer: (pause) No, I don't think I need to do that. But... can you do the nine months? And is there anything else?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I can apply the nine-month promotional rate of $69.99 per month, keeping you on the Gigabit plan. And let me see if I can add anything else... (typing sounds) What about if I waived your modem rental fee for those nine months as well? That'd save you an additional $10 a month.

Customer: Wait, I've been paying for a modem rental? How much is that?

Agent: It's $10 per month, so $120 a year.

Customer: Are you serious? I own my own modem. I brought my own equipment.

Agent: (pause) Let me look at this more carefully. (typing sounds) Oh, I see. You're actually not paying a modem rental fee. I apologize for the confusion there. It looks like you've got your own equipment on the account, so you're all set on that front.

Customer: Okay, so just the nine months at $69.99?

Agent: Right, and then after those nine months, your rate would adjust to the standard $99.99 per month, unless another promotion becomes available for you at that time. Does that work?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean... I guess. It's not ideal, but it's better than paying the extra twenty bucks for the next six months. When does this take effect?

Agent: Let me process this right now. (typing sounds) Okay, this will be effective on your next billing cycle, which looks like it starts November 15th. So you'll see the adjusted rate on your December bill.

Customer: December? So I'm still stuck paying $99.99 for November?

Agent: I understand your frustration. I can request to have this applied immediately to your current billing cycle, but I'll need to submit a supervisor override request for that. Give me just a moment. (pause - typing sounds) Okay, I've submitted that request. It should be approved within the next 24 hours, and if it goes through, you'll see a credit on your account for the difference from November.

Customer: Okay. That's... that's better.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate your help, Derek, even if I'm not thrilled about the situation.

Agent: I completely understand, James. I've made notes on your account about your feedback on the notification process, and I do apologize that we didn't communicate better beforehand. We definitely could have handled this more proactively. You should see that credit within the next day or so, and the promotional rate will be applied to your November 15th billing cycle. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and please let us know if there's anything else we can do for you.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day, James.

Customer: You too.
