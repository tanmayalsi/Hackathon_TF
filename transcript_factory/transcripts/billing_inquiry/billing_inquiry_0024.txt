Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged... I got my statement this morning and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like thirty dollars from last month and I want to know what that's about.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having billing concerns. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... hold on, let me grab my bill. Okay, the phone number is 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, let me pull that up here... Okay, I've got your account. I'm showing your service address is on Maple Street in... Carson, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned your bill increased this month. Let me take a look at what we're charging you. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing your Internet plan is our Fiber 500 package at $79.99 a month, and then you have... it looks like a modem rental fee of $12.99. Is that what you're seeing on your end?

Customer: Well, that's the thing. Last month I paid $49.99 for the internet. I know because I remember thinking it was a good deal. Now it's $79.99? That's a huge jump. And there's also this other charge I don't even know what it is. It says "equipment maintenance fee"... $9.99? I've never seen that before.

Agent: Okay, I understand your frustration. Let me check your account history here. (typing sounds) Alright, so I am seeing that you were on a promotional rate of $49.99 for the first year, and that promotion actually expired last month. So this month you're being moved to our standard rate of $79.99 for the Fiber 500 service.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. Nobody told me about that. I never got any notice about this. I mean, I read through my bills pretty carefully and I don't remember seeing anything about a price increase.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check what we have on file here. (pause) I'm showing that a notice was sent to your email on March 15th, which would have been about thirty days before your rate change took effect. Did you happen to receive an email from us?

Customer: I mean... probably? I get a lot of emails. But that's not really acceptable, you know? You should be calling people or sending something in the mail if you're going to raise their bill by thirty dollars. That's a big deal.

Agent: You know, I hear what you're saying, and I can definitely understand why that would be frustrating. The thing is, we do try to provide advance notice via email and it's also typically detailed in the terms and conditions that come with your service agreement. But I get it—not everyone catches those notices. And regarding the equipment maintenance fee...

Customer: Yeah, what is that? Why am I being charged for that?

Agent: (typing sounds) So that fee is actually something that was added to your account on... looks like April 2nd. Let me see if there's a note here about why... (pause) Okay, so it looks like you had a service technician out to your home, is that correct? To diagnose an internet connectivity issue?

Customer: Oh, yeah, actually I did. We were having some problems a couple weeks ago and I called in. Your technician came out and... I don't know, he did something with the router or the cables or whatever and it fixed the problem. But I thought that was going to be covered under my service plan.

Agent: Okay, so that's a good question. So if the technician diagnosed an issue with equipment or wiring that we own and repaired it, that typically wouldn't have a charge. But if the issue was determined to be something related to your home wiring or your personal equipment, we do charge for that service call. Let me pull up the service notes here... (pause) [inaudible] It says here that the technician found degradation in the external line coming to your house and performed a line replacement repair. That's a covered service, so that fee should not have been applied.

Customer: Okay, so you're saying I shouldn't have been charged for that?

Agent: That's correct. Based on the service notes, that should have been covered under your service plan. I'm going to remove that $9.99 charge from your account right now. (typing sounds) Done. You should see a credit appear on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, well, that's something. But I still don't feel good about the $30 internet rate increase without more notice. Can you do anything about that?

Agent: (pause) I understand, and I wish I had more flexibility there. Unfortunately, the promotional rate was a limited-time offer and once it expires, customers do move to our standard rate. That said... let me see what we might be able to do. (typing sounds) Do you happen to know if there are other internet providers in your area?

Customer: Um, yeah, there's... I think Comcast has something? I'm not really sure. Why?

Agent: Well, I'd hate to see you go elsewhere. Let me see if I can offer you something. Since you've been a good customer with us for... looks like about two years now... I can put you on an extended rate lock where I can bring that down to $64.99 a month for the next twelve months. After that, it would go back to the standard rate, but at least that gives you some time.

Customer: So that's still more than the $49.99 I was paying, but it's better than $79.99, I guess. How long would that be locked in?

Agent: So with this offer, it would be locked in at $64.99 for the next twelve months. After that, it would move to our standard rate, but you'd get another notification before that happens.

Customer: ...Alright. Yeah, okay, let's do that. And you're removing that $9.99 fee?

Agent: Yes, that's already been removed. (typing sounds) And I'm applying the rate lock now. So your new bill going forward will be $64.99 for your Internet service, plus the $12.99 modem rental fee, so your total monthly service charge will be $77.98. You should see that reflected on your next bill.

Customer: Okay. I appreciate that. I still think you all could do better with the notification, but I feel better about this.

Agent: I'm really glad we could work something out. And I appreciate your feedback about the notification process—I'll be sure to make a note of that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you for your help, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome! Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
