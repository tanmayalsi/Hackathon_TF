# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Actually, no, I recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it and... I think it might be wrong.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, thank you James. I see your account here. So you mentioned there's a charge you'd like to dispute. Can you tell me which charge that is?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill went up. Last month I was paying $79.99 for my internet, and this month it's showing $94.99. That's a fifteen dollar jump just out of nowhere. I haven't added any services or anything.

Agent: (pause) I understand your concern. Let me take a look at what's happening here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you had a promotional rate that was set to expire. You've been on a promotional pricing for the first twelve months of your service, and that promotion ended this month.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about that. I mean, I remember signing up for a deal, but I thought that was just... I don't know, I thought that was the regular price.

Agent: I completely understand. Sometimes these promotions aren't as clear as they should be. Let me explain what happened. You signed up on March 15th of last year for our Gigabit Fiber Internet service with a promotional rate of $79.99 per month for twelve months. That promotion has now ended, and you've transitioned to our standard rate of $94.99.

Customer: Okay, but that doesn't seem fair. I mean, I've been a good customer. I've never missed a payment. Why would you guys just increase my bill like that without any notice?

Agent: That's a fair point. (pause) Let me see what options I have available for you. We do send out notifications about promotional expirations, typically around 30 days before they expire. Did you receive anything in the mail or an email about this?

Customer: I... maybe? Honestly, I get so much mail and email. I might have just, you know, glossed over it thinking it was spam or something.

Agent: That happens more often than you'd think. (typing sounds) Okay, so here's what I can do for you. I can offer you an extended rate lock. We have a promotion running right now where I can put you on a 24-month plan at $84.99 per month. That would be lower than the standard rate you're currently on.

Customer: Hmm. So I'd still be going up five dollars from what I was paying, though. That's not really solving the problem.

Agent: I hear you. (pause) Let me see... (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at some loyalty options here. What I can do is I can credit your account for one month at the current rate as a service adjustment, and then lock you in at $84.99 for the next two years. So you'd get that $94.99 month at no charge, and then moving forward you'd be at $84.99.

Customer: That's... a little better, I guess. But I'm still paying five dollars more than I was before.

Agent: You're right, and I understand that's frustrating. Unfortunately, once the promotional period ends, we do transition customers to our standard pricing. However, $84.99 is still a savings compared to the full $94.99 rate. And this rate would be locked in for two years, so you wouldn't see any increases during that time.

Customer: (pause) Okay. I mean... I'm not thrilled about it, but I guess I don't have much of a choice, do I?

Agent: Well, you always have options. You could shop around with other providers if you'd like. But we do pride ourselves on our Frontier Fiber service. We're one of the fastest networks in your area, and customer satisfaction is [inaudible]. But I want to make sure you're comfortable with your service.

Customer: No, no, I like the internet service. The speeds are good. I just... I don't like surprises with my bill, you know?

Agent: Absolutely. That's totally understandable. So let me make sure I have this right. I'm going to credit your account one month at $94.99, and then I'm going to lock you in at $84.99 per month for the next 24 months. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Do I need to do anything on my end?

Agent: (typing sounds) No, I'm doing this all right now. Let me just process this... (pause) And... there we go. Everything is all set. Your next billing cycle should reflect the credit, and your rate going forward will be $84.99.

Customer: Alright. And this is locked in for two years?

Agent: That's correct. For 24 months from today. After that, we can discuss options at that time.

Customer: Okay, good. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course, James. I'm sorry we caught you off guard with the rate change. I know that wasn't ideal. Just in the future, keep an eye out for those promotional expiration notices. We usually send them about a month in advance, so you have time to adjust.

Customer: Yeah, I'll pay better attention next time.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for taking care of this.

Agent: My pleasure. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
