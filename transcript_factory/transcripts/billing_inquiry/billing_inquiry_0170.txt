Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. Um, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that shouldn't be there. I'm pretty frustrated, honestly.

Agent: I understand, and I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into this for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. And my name is James Chen, by the way.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, James, I've got you pulled up here. Let me just verify a couple things real quick. Is the phone number ending in 4892?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And just to confirm, you're calling about a charge that appeared on your most recent bill?

Customer: Yes, exactly. I was charged an extra $24.99 for something called a "modem rental fee," and I don't have a rented modem. I own my own modem. I've had the same modem for like three years now.

Agent: Ah, okay. Let me take a look at your account here. (pause) (typing sounds) So I'm seeing that on your last billing cycle, there was indeed a modem rental fee added. That is unusual if you're bringing your own equipment. Can I ask, did you recently have any service calls or changes made to your account?

Customer: No, nothing like that. The service has been fine. I mean, that's not the only issue either. My internet speed tier went up $15 a month out of nowhere. I was on the 300 Mbps plan for $89.99, and now it's showing $104.99. Nobody told me about this.

Agent: (pause) Hmm, let me pull up your billing history here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking back at your account, and I can see that... yeah, your rate did increase about 60 days ago. That promotional rate you had actually expired.

Customer: A promotional rate? I've had this service for three years. That wasn't supposed to expire. Nobody ever told me about any expiration date.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, James. Let me explain what might have happened here. When you first signed up, you likely had an introductory rate for 12 months. After that period ended, your rate returned to the standard rate for that speed tier in your area.

Customer: Well, that's... I mean, that's not great, but I guess if I agreed to that. But what about this modem rental thing? I definitely didn't agree to that.

Agent: You're right, and that one shouldn't be there if you're using your own equipment. (typing sounds) Let me see... I'm wondering if there was an error on our end, or possibly if there was a system update that triggered it. Can I ask, what model modem are you using?

Customer: It's a, um... (pause) ...it's a NETGEAR CM600. I think that's the model number.

Agent: Okay, and that's compatible with our service?

Customer: Yeah, I checked that when I first got it. It's been working fine the whole time.

Agent: Perfect. That is definitely compatible. So this modem rental charge should not have been applied to your account. Let me go ahead and remove that for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, I've adjusted your bill and removed that $24.99 charge. That should be reflected in your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay, that's good. I appreciate that. But what about the $15 price increase?

Agent: Right, so that's a bit more complex. The rate increase is what we call the standard rate once your promotional pricing expired. However... (pause) I do have some options for you. I can look into whether we have any current promotions or loyalty offers that might apply to your account.

Customer: What kind of offers?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so looking at your account and your tenure with us... you've been with Frontier for three years now, which is great. We do have a loyalty promotion right now where I can offer you 12 months at $94.99 for your 300 Mbps plan. That's not quite the original rate, but it's $10 less than what you're currently being charged.

Customer: So after 12 months, it's just going to go back up again?

Agent: (pause) Well, that's correct. After the 12-month promotional period, yes, you would return to the standard rate unless another promotion becomes available at that time.

Customer: That doesn't really feel like a solution. I mean, I like my internet service, but this feels like you're just trying to get me hooked with a lower price and then jack it up again.

Agent: I hear you, James, and I understand that's frustrating. Honestly, that's just how our industry works with promotional rates. But I want to be upfront with you—if we do this 12-month offer, you'd be locked in at $94.99, and when it comes up for renewal, you'd have the option to review it then. There's no obligation, and you could potentially negotiate again at that point or look at other options.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay, so you're saying I should just accept that this is how it's going to work?

Agent: I'm not saying you have to, but yes, this is pretty standard. What I can do is make sure you're getting the best rate possible right now, and we can at least get you a savings on the price increase you were hit with. Plus, I want to make sure you have my direct information so if anything else unusual pops up on your account, you can reach out to me directly.

Customer: (pause) Alright, yeah. Okay, let's do the $94.99 promotion for 12 months. But I want to make sure I'm not being charged for anything I'm not supposed to be charged for. Can you go through my bill with me?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me pull up your full account details. (typing sounds) So what I'm seeing now is: your 300 Mbps Internet service will be $94.99—that's the promotional rate we just applied. You also have our basic router included with that plan, so no equipment fee there since you're using your own modem. Do you have phone or TV service with us?

Customer: No, just internet.

Agent: Perfect, so it's just that one line item. Your bill should be $94.99 plus applicable taxes, which in your area brings it to... (typing sounds) ...about $103.48 total with taxes included.

Customer: Okay, and that's locked in for the next 12 months?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. For the next 12 months, your promotional rate of $94.99 is locked in. You'll receive a notification 30 days before that promotion expires so you're not caught off guard like this time.

Customer: Good. I appreciate that. So what about the $24.99 I was already charged for the modem rental?

Agent: Excellent question. So I've removed the charge from your account, and that credit of $24.99 should show on your next bill. Depending on your billing cycle, that could be in the next week or two.

Customer: Okay, great. I think... yeah, I think that works for me. I'm still not thrilled about the whole promotional rate expiring thing, but at least this helps.

Agent: I totally understand. And James, I really do appreciate your patience and loyalty to Frontier over the past three years. If you ever need anything else or if you have any questions before your next bill, don't hesitate to reach out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you for taking care of this.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
