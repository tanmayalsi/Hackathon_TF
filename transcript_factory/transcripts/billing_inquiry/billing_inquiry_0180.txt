Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I was told my internet was supposed to stay the same price, and now it's gone up like fifteen dollars a month.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up for you here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's under Michael Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I'm bringing up your account now. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your current bill here. I can see the concern. What specific charge are you seeing that's new?

Customer: Well, I'm looking at my bill right now, and my internet service went from 79.99 to 94.99. That's like... that's almost a fifteen dollar increase. When I signed up, the rep told me the price was locked in for twelve months.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Michael. Let me take a look at your account details here. (typing sounds) Can you tell me approximately when you signed up for your service?

Customer: It was... I think it was about eight months ago? Maybe nine? It was in the spring sometime.

Agent: Okay, so you're still within that promotional period. That's really helpful information. Let me pull up your service agreement. (pause) Alright, I'm seeing your account here. You did sign up for our Gigabit Fiber service on March 15th, with a 12-month price guarantee at $79.99 per month. According to our system, that rate shouldn't adjust until March of next year.

Customer: Right, exactly! So why am I being charged more?

Agent: That's a great question, and I appreciate you calling in about this. It looks like there may have been a system error or a note that wasn't properly recorded. I'm also seeing here... (pause) oh, I see there's an additional charge listed for what's labeled as a "service upgrade." Did you recently upgrade your equipment or add any services to your account?

Customer: No, I didn't. I didn't request anything. Is that something you guys just added without asking me?

Agent: That's not typical for us, but let me investigate that further. Can you hold for just one moment while I check the notes on your account?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music briefly) Thank you for holding, Michael. Okay, so I've looked into this, and it appears that during a recent system update, some accounts were inadvertently flagged for a modem rental fee that should have been waived as part of your promotional package. That would account for about $14.99 of that increase. I'm really sorry about that.

Customer: So you guys basically charged me for something I shouldn't have been charged for?

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that error on our end. Here's what I'm going to do for you. I'm going to remove that modem rental fee immediately, which will bring your bill back down to $79.99 where it should be. That will be effective on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay... well, that's good, but what about this month? Do I have to pay the full amount, or...?

Agent: That's a fair question. Because this was our error, I'm going to issue you a credit for the overcharge on this bill. So you'll see a credit of $14.99 applied to your account within the next billing cycle. You shouldn't owe anything for this month beyond your normal $79.99.

Customer: (pause) Okay, well, that's... that's better. I appreciate that. I just want to make sure this doesn't happen again, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. I'm making a note right here on your account about this situation so that if there's any issues in the future, our team will see exactly what happened. And I'm also flagging your account to ensure your promotional rate stays locked in through March 15th of next year as originally promised.

Customer: Alright, thank you. I'm sorry for being a bit short with you—it's just frustrating when stuff like this happens.

Agent: No, please don't apologize. You had every right to call in and question that charge. That's what we're here for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I'll watch for that credit on my next bill.

Agent: Perfect. Your account number is 555-0847, and the credit of $14.99 will appear on your next billing statement. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, Michael, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. Have a good one.

Agent: You too, Michael. Take care!
