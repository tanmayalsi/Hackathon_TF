# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also... I think my price went up?

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, just give me one second here... Alright, I've got you pulled up. Your name is David Hernandez, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned a charge you don't recognize and a price increase. Let me walk through your recent statement here. (pause) So looking at your current bill for this month, you're being charged $89.99 for your service. Is that what you're seeing?

Customer: Well, yeah, that's part of the problem. Last month it was $79.99. I don't remember anyone telling me there was going to be a price increase, and that's already... that's a $10 jump. But then there's also this other charge that I don't know what it is. It says like... "Equipment Recovery Fee" for $25?

Agent: Okay, I see both of those. Let me explain what I can here. So the price increase from $79.99 to $89.99 for the 500 Mbps plan—

Customer: Wait, when did that go into effect? I never got a notice or anything.

Agent: (pause) That's a great question. Let me pull up the notes on your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like you should have received a notice about this. It would have come via email and also as an insert in your bill about 30 days prior to the rate change. Do you remember getting anything like that?

Customer: No, I... I don't think so. I mean, I might delete emails without reading them sometimes, but still, nobody should just raise someone's bill without... I mean, these things happen but I should've been told.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and you're right—we do send notices, but I understand these things can sometimes end up in spam folders or get overlooked. As for the rate increase itself, that went into effect with your October billing cycle. The increase is due to network infrastructure improvements we're making in your area to support higher speeds and reliability.

Customer: Okay, but can we talk about the $25 charge? What is that Equipment Recovery Fee?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, let me look at that. (pause) Hmm, that's unusual. It says here that the fee is associated with a modem that wasn't returned when service was terminated on another account.

Customer: Wait, what? What other account? I only have one account with Frontier.

Agent: Let me check into this because that does sound odd. (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like there might have been a service order issue. When did you update your equipment last?

Customer: Um, I mean, I've had the same modem for like... I think like three or four years now? I don't remember ever returning anything.

Agent: Okay, that would make sense. Let me note this and get to the bottom of this for you, because if you never returned equipment, you shouldn't be charged a recovery fee on your current account. Can you hold for just one moment while I look into your service history?

Customer: Yeah, sure. I've got a few minutes.

Agent: (hold music plays) (background noise) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I found the issue. It looks like there was a data entry error on our end. Your account was somehow linked to a previous account from the same address that was closed three years ago. When that old account was terminated, a modem wasn't returned, and somehow that $25 fee got applied to your current account by mistake.

Customer: So it's not even supposed to be on my bill?

Agent: That's correct. I'm very sorry about that. I'm going to remove that $25 charge right now. (typing sounds) Okay, that's done. You should see a credit for that on your next statement.

Customer: Okay, well, at least that's something. But what about the price increase? Is there anything you can do about that, or is it just happening to everyone?

Agent: So the rate increase is a company-wide change, and unfortunately I'm not able to adjust that. However, what I can do is... are you currently on a promotional rate, or is this your standard pricing?

Customer: I think it's just the regular rate. I've been with Frontier for like five years, so any promotion would've expired by now.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. What I can do is see if there are any new promotions or plans available that might work better for you. We do have a 12-month price lock available on some of our packages. Your current plan is 500 Mbps, correct?

Customer: Yeah. Do we really need that speed? I mean, it seems fine for what we use it for.

Agent: Good question. We also have a 300 Mbps plan that's $69.99 per month, if you're interested in downgrading. That would actually save you money compared to what you're currently paying before the increase. Would that be something you'd consider?

Customer: (pause) Hmm. I guess I could look at that. What about the price lock you mentioned?

Agent: So if you want to keep the 500 Mbps plan, I can put you on a 12-month price lock at $84.99 per month. That would be $5 less than the standard price you'd be paying, and the rate won't increase during that 12-month period.

Customer: So instead of $89.99, I'd pay $84.99?

Agent: Exactly. That includes the price lock promotion.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, I think I'd rather do that than downgrade. Can you just... can you credit me for this month too? For the inconvenience? Since I was overcharged with that equipment fee and didn't get proper notice of the increase?

Agent: (pause) I appreciate you asking. What I can do is credit you $15 toward this month's balance, which would bring your bill down to $74.99 for this month. After that, starting next month, you'll be at $84.99 with the price lock in place for the next 12 months.

Customer: I guess that's fair. Alright, let's do that.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got everything set up for you. So to confirm: I've removed the $25 Equipment Recovery Fee, I've applied a $15 credit to your current bill, and I've enrolled you in the 500 Mbps plan with a 12-month price lock at $84.99 per month. That price lock is effective immediately, so your next bill should show the correct amount.

Customer: Great, thank you. I appreciate you helping me sort that out.

Agent: You're very welcome, and I'm sorry again for the confusion with the billing error and the lack of notice on the rate increase. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it.

Agent: Wonderful. Well, thank you so much for choosing Frontier Communications, David. We really appreciate your five years of loyalty. If you need anything in the future, feel free to give us a call back anytime.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
