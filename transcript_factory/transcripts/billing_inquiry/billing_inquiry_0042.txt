Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm seeing a charge that wasn't there before. It's like, it went up by almost thirty dollars and I have no idea why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here. One moment...

(pause)

Agent: Okay, I've got your account here. I'm seeing... it looks like your name is Michael Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Michael. So you mentioned you saw an increase on your most recent bill. When did you set up your account with us?

Customer: Oh, um... I think it was like, two years ago? Maybe a little longer. I honestly don't remember exactly, but it's been a while.

Agent: Okay, and have you had any service changes recently, or did anything change with your account?

Customer: No, nothing. I've had the same internet plan the whole time. That's why this charge is so weird. I literally didn't do anything different.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me look at the billing history here... (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you've been on our Fiber 100 plan at $79.99 a month since... yes, about two years ago. And on this current bill, I see it's showing... $109.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yes! Exactly. That's it. That thirty dollar jump. Why would that happen? Did I accidentally upgrade or something? Because I definitely didn't ask for that.

Agent: Let me check your account notes here... (pause) Okay, so I'm not seeing any service upgrades on your end. What actually happened is that your promotional rate expired. When you first signed up two years ago, you were on a promotional pricing for the first 24 months, and that's just concluded.

Customer: Wait, what? No one ever told me about that. I mean, I don't remember seeing anything in the mail or... I should have been notified about that, right?

Agent: That's a great point, and I apologize for the confusion. We do typically send out notices about promotional rates ending. Let me see if I can locate... (typing sounds) ...yes, I see that a notice was mailed to your address about 30 days before the rate change took effect. Sometimes these can get lost in the mail, which I totally understand.

Customer: Well, I didn't get it. This is frustrating because now I'm paying almost forty percent more for the same service. That's not really fair.

Agent: I completely hear you, and I appreciate your patience. The good news is that we do have options available to you. Let me see what current promotions I can offer your account.

(pause, typing sounds)

Agent: Okay, so I'm looking at what we have available right now. I can't match your original promotional rate, but I do have a special rate of $89.99 for 12 months if you'd like to stay with us, and that would bring your bill down from the $109.99.

Customer: So I'd still be paying more than what I was paying before though.

Agent: That's correct. Your promotional period has ended, so the rates are adjusted. However, the $89.99 would be a significant savings compared to the current standard rate, and it's a 12-month commitment, so your rate would stay locked in for that year.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) What if I cancel and go with another provider? Like, what would happen then?

Agent: Well, we certainly don't want to lose you as a customer, Michael. But I do want to be honest with you—if you terminate your service, there wouldn't be any early termination fees on your account since you're out of your initial contract period. You're free to explore other options if you'd like. That said, we pride ourselves on our Fiber 100 service, which is pretty reliable in your area. A lot of customers tell us they've had good experiences with us.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess the service has been pretty good, no complaints there. But I'm still not thrilled about this increase.

Agent: I understand. Let me see what else I might be able to do here... (typing sounds) You know what, let me check if there are any other promotions available. Sometimes I have access to special offers for valued customers...

(pause, longer pause)

Agent: Okay, Michael, I'm going to do something special for you. I can offer you $84.99 a month for 12 months. This would be a courtesy offer given your tenure with us and because of the miscommunication about the rate expiration. How does that sound?

Customer: Really? So that'd be just five dollars more than what I was paying before?

Agent: Exactly. That would bring it down to $84.99 for the next year.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean... that's a lot better. I can work with that. But I just want to say, I should've gotten a heads up about this. Like, a phone call or an email or something more clear than just a letter.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I'm going to make a note on your account about that feedback. We definitely appreciate that input, and I'm sorry it wasn't communicated more clearly to you. This kind of feedback does help us improve our customer service.

Customer: Okay, well... thank you for doing that. So when does this new rate start?

Agent: This new rate will go into effect on your next billing cycle, so you should see it on your bill next month. Your next bill will reflect the $84.99 rate.

Customer: Perfect. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course, Michael. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm good.

Agent: Great. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and thanks for being a customer with us. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
