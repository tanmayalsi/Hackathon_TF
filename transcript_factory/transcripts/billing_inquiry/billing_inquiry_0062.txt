Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement for this month and there's a charge on here that shouldn't be there.

Agent: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my landline number too.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, just give me one second here... Alright, I'm pulling up your account for Sarah Mitchell. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And what charge are you seeing that concerns you?

Customer: Well, okay, so I've had the same plan for like two years now—the 300 Mbps fiber package with the TV bundle. It was $89.99 a month, right? And now this month my bill jumped to $119.99. That's a thirty dollar increase and nobody told me about it.

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. Let me take a look at your account history here... (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you're correct—your promotional rate did expire at the end of last month. You were on a two-year promotional pricing agreement that ran from August 2022 through August 2024. Now you're rolling into our standard rate for that package.

Customer: Wait, what? I wasn't told about this. I mean, I should have gotten some kind of notice or something. This is the first I'm hearing about it.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Let me check our notes here to see if we sent out any notifications... (pause) It looks like we did mail out a notice about sixty days before the promotion ended. It should have arrived sometime in June. Do you remember receiving anything from us?

Customer: I mean... maybe? I get a lot of mail. But shouldn't you guys call or email or something? Like, just a heads up?

Agent: That's actually really great feedback, and I do apologize for the confusion. You know, we do typically mail out notices, but I hear you—an email reminder would definitely be helpful. Unfortunately, the promotional period has ended, so you are now on our standard rate. However, I do have some options that might help.

Customer: Like what?

Agent: Well, we actually have a retention offer available. Since you've been such a loyal customer for the past two years, I can apply a new promotional rate. We can get you back down to $99.99 a month for the next twelve months. That's still a ten dollar increase from what you were paying, but it's a significant savings compared to the $119.99.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. So I'd still be paying more than I was before?

Agent: That's correct, yes. The $89.99 rate was a promotional rate for new customers, and after two years, that does expire. But the $99.99 is our best retention offer right now, and that's locked in for the next year. After that, we can discuss your options again when that promotion ends.

Customer: What if I just cancel? Like, do you have any other offers if I'm thinking about switching providers?

Agent: I appreciate the question. (pause) If you're looking to cancel, I definitely don't want to lose you as a customer. Let me see if I have anything else available... (typing sounds) Actually, I might be able to offer you $94.99 for twelve months. That would be even better. It's only a five dollar increase from your original rate.

Customer: Really? How come you didn't offer that right away?

Agent: That's fair feedback. I should have presented all our options upfront. I apologize for that. Yes, I can apply that $94.99 rate for you today if you'd like.

Customer: And that's for a full year?

Agent: Yes, locked in for twelve months. Then we'll need to revisit it after that period.

Customer: (pause) Okay, fine. I mean, it's not ideal, but that's better than thirty dollars more. What do I need to do?

Agent: Great, I'm glad we could find something that works for you. I'm going to go ahead and apply that rate to your account right now. (typing sounds) And you should see that reflected on your next billing cycle, which would be... (pause) ...September 15th. You'll receive a confirmation email within the next couple of hours with all the details of the new rate and the terms.

Customer: Okay. And just to be clear, this is definitely for twelve months, right?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. Twelve months locked in at $94.99. After that date, if you don't contact us, it will revert to standard pricing again, so we'll send you another notification before that happens.

Customer: Alright. Can you also make a note on my account that I prefer to be contacted by email instead of mail about these kinds of things going forward?

Agent: Absolutely, I can do that. (typing sounds) Done. I've noted that you prefer email communication for promotional expirations and billing changes. We'll make sure that happens next time.

Customer: Thank you. I appreciate that.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Sarah?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: It's my pleasure. Thank you for being a valued Frontier customer, and I apologize again for the confusion with the rate change. If you need anything else in the future, please don't hesitate to call us back.

Customer: Will do. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, Sarah. Thanks for calling Frontier.
