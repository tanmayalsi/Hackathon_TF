Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. And honestly, my bill went up pretty significantly from last month, and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. And can I get a name for verification?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. Thanks for that. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account now. I can see your bill from this month. What specific charge are you concerned about?

Customer: Well, for starters, my monthly service charge went from $79.99 to $99.99. That's a twenty dollar jump right there. And then there's this other line item that says "Equipment Upgrade Fee - $49.99" that wasn't on my bill last month.

Agent: Okay, I see both of those. Let me explain what happened. So the price increase on your service plan... (pause) do you remember if you were on any kind of promotional rate?

Customer: (hesitating) Um... I think when I signed up, yeah, they said something about a special offer, but that was like three years ago. I didn't think it would just... expire like that without someone telling me.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Those promotional rates do have an end date, and unfortunately after that period, the rate goes back to our standard pricing. It looks like your intro rate ended, which is why you're seeing the increase. I apologize if you didn't receive a notification about that—we typically send those out, but sometimes they get missed.

Customer: That's... okay, I guess I could've kept better track of it myself. But what about this equipment upgrade fee? I didn't ask for any equipment upgrade. I didn't get anything new.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me look into that for you. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing here that... it looks like you were automatically enrolled in our Gateway Plus upgrade program. This would give you our newer fiber gateway modem with Wi-Fi 6 technology, which is supposed to improve your speeds and coverage.

Customer: I didn't enroll in anything! Nobody called me about this. I didn't opt in for this.

Agent: I understand, and I sincerely apologize for that. It looks like this may have been added to your account without your explicit consent, which shouldn't have happened. Let me see what I can do for you here.

(pause, typing sounds)

Customer: Like, I don't even need a new modem. My internet works fine. Can you just... remove it?

Agent: Absolutely, we can definitely look at that. First, let me ask—have you received the new modem yet, or is this just showing up as a pending charge on your bill?

Customer: No, I haven't received anything. It just showed up on the bill.

Agent: Okay, good. So the equipment hasn't been shipped yet. I'm going to remove that equipment upgrade fee right now from your account, and I'll make sure that program is canceled so you won't be charged for it. (typing sounds) And I'm going to credit that $49.99 back to your account.

Customer: Thank you. But what about the twenty dollar increase? Can you do anything about that?

Agent: (pause) Well, regarding the rate increase... since that was the expiration of your promotional period, that's typically not something I can reverse. However, let me see if there are any other promotions or plans available for you right now. (typing sounds) Are you currently in a contract with us, or are you month-to-month?

Customer: I think I'm month-to-month at this point. The three-year agreement I had is definitely over.

Agent: Okay, so I'm looking at our current offerings, and actually, I do see that we have a promotion running right now for returning customers. I could potentially get you back down to $89.99 per month for the next twelve months, which would save you ten dollars a month compared to the standard rate.

Customer: (hesitating) So it would still be ten dollars more than what I was paying, but less than what they're charging me now?

Agent: That's correct. It's not quite back to your original rate, but it does bring it down somewhat. It would be a twelve-month commitment, so you'd be locked in at that rate for a year.

Customer: (sighs) I mean... I guess that's better than nothing. Sure, I'll take that.

Agent: Excellent. Let me go ahead and apply that to your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so here's what I've done for you today. I've removed the equipment upgrade fee and credited the $49.99. I've canceled the Gateway Plus program so you won't receive that modem. And I've applied our twelve-month promotional rate of $89.99 to your account, which will take effect on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Thank you. When do I see these changes on my bill?

Agent: Your next bill will reflect all of these adjustments. So you should see the credit applied, and the new rate will show up when your billing cycle renews. That should be... (typing sounds) about five days from now for you.

Customer: Okay, that's good. And just to confirm, I won't be charged for that modem, right?

Agent: That's correct. You will not be charged for the modem, and you won't receive it. The equipment upgrade has been completely removed.

Customer: Alright, well, I appreciate you taking care of all that. I'm not thrilled about any price increase at all, but at least this is more reasonable.

Agent: I completely understand, and I really do apologize for the inconvenience with that unauthorized equipment enrollment. That shouldn't have happened. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, David, and thank you for calling in. You should receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details of the changes we made today. If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to give us a call back.

Customer: Thanks, I will. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day!
