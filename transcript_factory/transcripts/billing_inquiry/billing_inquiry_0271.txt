# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I don't know, something seems off. My internet bill went up like thirty dollars out of nowhere and I want to know why.

Agent: I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up right now. And your name?

Customer: Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. Let me just verify here... (pause) Alright, I've got your account open. I can definitely see the billing change you're referring to. Your bill went from $89.99 to $119.99 this month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, exactly! That's what I'm looking at. I've been a customer for like three years and my bill has always been the same. Why would it suddenly jump thirty bucks?

Agent: I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Let me explain what I'm seeing here. (pause) It looks like you were on a promotional rate for the first 12 months of your service. That promotion expired, and you've now transitioned to our standard pricing for the Fiber 300 package.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about that. I mean... I guess maybe they did when I signed up, but I don't remember anything about it being temporary.

Agent: I completely understand. These promotional periods can definitely catch people off guard. The 12-month promotional rate ended on September 15th, which is why you're seeing the increase on this month's bill. So the new rate of $119.99 is our regular price for that service tier.

Customer: That's ridiculous though. Twelve dollars would be bad enough, but thirty dollars? There's no way that was the regular price. Let me... hold on. (rustling sounds) I have some promotional materials here somewhere...

Agent: (waiting, typing sounds)

Customer: Okay, so here's what it said when I signed up. It says "Get Fiber 300 for $89.99 a month for 12 months, then regular price applies." So regular price is apparently $119.99. But that seems... I mean, that's a huge jump. Do you have any other options? Can I downgrade or something?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me see what we have available for you. (pause) So we do have a few options. We could move you to our Fiber 100 package, which would be $69.99 a month, or you could stay on Fiber 300 at the $119.99 rate. We also have Fiber 500 if you're interested in faster speeds—that's $149.99.

Customer: No, I don't need faster speeds. But I also don't want to go down to the slower speed. I'm really just frustrated that this wasn't communicated to me better. Is there... I mean, is there anything you can do? Like a retention offer or something?

Agent: (pause) That's a fair point. Let me see what options I have available here. (typing sounds) You know what, Jennifer, because you've been such a loyal customer for three years, and I can see this is your first dispute, let me see if I can get you some credit. Can you give me just one moment while I check with my supervisor on what we can offer?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (brief hold music plays, then fades out after about 30 seconds)

Agent: Jennifer? I'm back.

Customer: Yep, I'm here.

Agent: Okay, great. So I was able to get you a promotional rate for the next six months. I can bring your Fiber 300 package down to $99.99 a month for the next six billing cycles. After that, it would go back to the standard rate of $119.99.

Customer: Oh... okay. That's... that's better, I guess. So I'd be paying $99.99 for six months, and then it goes back up to $119.99?

Agent: Correct. And I want to be transparent with you—I'm also going to credit your account $30 to help offset this first bill. That'll show up on your next statement.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Yeah, I appreciate that. That's actually really helpful. I just... I wish this had been clearer from the start, you know?

Agent: I completely agree, and I apologize for the frustration this has caused. You should have received more communication about the promotion ending. I'm going to make a note on your account about this conversation, and I'm going to have a supervisor review your account to see if there's anything else we can do on our end.

Customer: Thank you. Yeah, that's good to hear.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today, Jennifer?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I appreciate your help, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
