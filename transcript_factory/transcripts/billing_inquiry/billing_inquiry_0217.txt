Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Actually, there are a couple things that don't look right.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. And before you ask, yes, I've been a customer for like... three years now? Maybe more. And I've never had any issues until this month.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account now. The number ending in 0147, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, I've got you here. I can see your account is for... 500 Mbps fiber service at the Riverside address, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. So, uh, my bill last month was $79.99, and this month it jumped up to $99.99. That's a twenty dollar increase for no reason that I can see. Did you guys raise your rates or something?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me take a look at what's happened on your account. (pause) Okay, so I can see that your promotional rate did expire at the end of last billing cycle. You were on a 12-month promotional rate of $79.99, and that promotion ended on the 15th of last month.

Customer: Wait, what? I wasn't told about any promotional rate ending. I mean, I don't remember getting any notification about this. That seems like something you guys should have told me about.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me check if we sent out any notifications. (typing sounds) I can see here that a notification was sent to the email address on file about 30 days prior to the rate change. Did you... did you happen to receive that email?

Customer: I don't... I mean, I might have? I get a lot of emails. But that's kind of the problem, isn't it? You could have called me, or sent something in the mail with my bill. I'm sure I would have noticed if it was in my bill.

Agent: That's a fair point. I apologize that the email notification didn't reach you in a way that was more noticeable. So, to clarify, the $99.99 is the standard rate for your service tier without any promotional pricing. However, I may be able to help you here.

Customer: Really? Because that's almost a 25 percent increase. That's... that's a lot of money.

Agent: I hear you. (pause) What I can do is check if there are any current promotions I can apply to your account. Let me see what we have available... (typing sounds, longer pause) Okay, so I can get you back down to $89.99 for the next 12 months, and that would include a waiver of the rate increase for this current billing cycle.

Customer: So I'd get a credit for the extra twenty dollars?

Agent: (pause) Let me see... I can apply a one-time credit of $20 to your account, and then the new rate of $89.99 would start on your next billing cycle. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) I mean, it's better than nothing, I guess. But I'm still paying more than I was before. Why wouldn't you just keep me at the same rate?

Agent: I understand where you're coming from. The promotional rate was a limited-time offer, and after that period ends, we do have to move customers to the standard rate. But the $89.99 rate I'm offering is ten dollars less than our current standard rate, so it's a bit of a middle ground here.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, fine. What else? You said there were a couple things on your bill that didn't look right?

Agent: Oh, right. What was the other charge you were concerned about?

Customer: There's a line item here for... (rustling sounds) ...$4.99 for something called "Advanced WiFi Management." I don't remember signing up for that, and I don't even know what it is.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me pull that up for you. Advanced WiFi Management is a service that optimizes your WiFi network and provides remote diagnostics. Let me check how that got added to your account... (pause) It looks like it was added about two months ago. Do you recall making any changes to your service around that time?

Customer: No, I don't think so. Could it have been added by accident? Or... wait, did I maybe click on something when I was checking my account online?

Agent: It's possible. Sometimes it can be added during a service adjustment or through the customer portal if you were browsing available add-ons. However, I can remove this for you right now if you'd like, since you didn't intentionally sign up for it.

Customer: Yeah, please remove it. I don't need that. I've got my own WiFi setup.

Agent: (typing sounds) Done. I'm removing the Advanced WiFi Management service from your account effective immediately. You won't see that charge on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, good. So just to recap, I'm getting the $20 credit, the rate is going to be $89.99 starting next month, and that Advanced WiFi thing is gone?

Agent: That's exactly right. I'm also going to add a note to your account about the promotional rate expiration so that in a year, when that rate is set to end, we'll make sure to reach out to you proactively before the change takes effect. Would you prefer a phone call or an email for that notification?

Customer: (pause) A phone call would be better, honestly.

Agent: Perfect. I've made that note. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. I appreciate your patience, and I'm sorry we didn't handle the communication better on the rate change. Your account should be all set. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
