Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like thirty dollars since last month, so I'm pretty frustrated right now.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for the frustration. I'm happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And just to confirm, is this a residential or business account?

Customer: Residential.

Agent: Great. (pause) Okay, I'm pulling up your account now... I can see your account here. I show you're in the Bakersfield area, is that right?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So you're saying your bill increased about thirty dollars from last month?

Customer: Yeah, basically. Last month it was like $79.99, and now it's showing $109.99. And there's also this random charge for like... let me see... "service recovery credit reversal" or something? I don't even know what that is.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me take a look at those charges. Give me just one second here... (pause) Alright, so I'm seeing a few things on your account. First, can you tell me—did you make any changes to your service recently? Like adding a streaming package or upgrading your internet speed?

Customer: No, nothing like that. I've had the same service for like two years. I didn't change anything.

Agent: Okay, understood. So the service recovery credit reversal—that's actually interesting. Let me explain what that is. It looks like you had a promotional credit that was applied to your account that expired at the end of last month. You were getting a $24.99 monthly discount, and that promotion ended, so that's where that increase is coming from.

Customer: Wait, what? A promotion ended? I never... I mean, I don't remember being told about that. How long was I getting that discount?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check the details here... It looks like the promotion started about... twenty-four months ago, so right around when you started service or close to it. The terms were a twelve-month promotional rate, and then it looks like it was extended for another twelve months, but that extension ended on January 31st.

Customer: Okay, so you're telling me that I got a discount for two years and now I don't, and somehow that's on me? I feel like I should've gotten a notification about that.

Agent: You know what, that's a fair point. Let me look into your account notes here. (pause) I'm not seeing any notification that was sent out. That's something we should have communicated better. I apologize for that. But I do want to help make this right. Let me see what options I have available for you.

Customer: I mean, the thing is, I liked the old price. Is there any way to get that back?

Agent: That's a great question. The original promotional rate isn't available anymore, but I do have some options for you. Since you've been a loyal customer for two years and we didn't properly notify you about the promotion ending, I can look into what current promotions I can apply to your account. (typing sounds) Let me check what's available... 

Are you open to bundling your service, by any chance? Do you have home phone or anything with us?

Customer: No, it's just internet. I have my cell phone and I don't really need a home phone.

Agent: Okay, that's fine. So I'm looking at what I can do here... I can offer you a $15 monthly discount if you agree to a twelve-month service agreement. That would bring your bill down to $94.99. It's not quite the $79.99 you were paying, but it's a significant savings from the $109.99 you're looking at now.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) So I'd be locked into a contract?

Agent: Yes, for twelve months. After that, the rate would go back to regular pricing unless another promotion is available at that time. But I want to be transparent with you—we would send you a notification at least thirty days before that promotion expires so you won't be surprised again.

Customer: (sighs) I guess that's better than paying $110. But I'm not thrilled about the contract thing. Can't you do any better?

Agent: Let me see what else I can look into for you. (pause, typing sounds) So, you're currently on our 300 Mbps plan, correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the speed I have.

Agent: Okay. Well, I could potentially offer you a $20 monthly discount, but that would require upgrading to our 500 Mbps plan, which is faster internet. That would actually keep your total bill around $99.99, so you'd save about $10 from the current price, and you'd get faster speeds.

Customer: Really? So I get faster internet and it costs less?

Agent: Exactly. The faster plan with the promotion would be $99.99 a month instead of the $109.99 you're seeing now. And that promotion would also be for twelve months with the same notification policy.

Customer: Okay, well... I guess that works for me. I mean, faster internet is something I could actually use anyway. My husband is always complaining about buffering when he's streaming.

Agent: Excellent. That should help with that then. So to confirm, I'm upgrading you to our 500 Mbps plan and applying a $20 monthly promotional discount for twelve months, bringing your bill to $99.99 per month. And I'm also going to make a notation on your account that we failed to properly notify you about the previous promotion ending, so we've made this adjustment as a courtesy.

Customer: Great. So when does this take effect?

Agent: The changes will take effect on your next billing cycle, which based on what I'm seeing here should be... (typing sounds) ...February 15th. You should see the new rate reflected on that bill. In the meantime, we'll be scheduling a technician to upgrade your equipment to support the faster speeds. That's a free service visit, by the way. You should receive a call within the next two business days with an appointment window.

Customer: Okay, perfect. And what about that service recovery credit reversal charge? Is that coming off the bill?

Agent: That charge itself isn't something I can remove because it already posted, but since we're crediting you $20 monthly going forward, you're going to save that amount times twelve, so you'll definitely come out ahead. However, let me see if there's anything I can do about this current bill... (pause, typing sounds) I can apply a one-time $10 credit to your account as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience of not being notified about the promotion ending. That should help offset some of that charge this month.

Customer: Oh, okay! Yeah, that helps. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Absolutely, and again, I apologize that we didn't handle the notification better the first time around. You should be all set. You'll get that tech call within two business days, and if you have any questions before then, just give us a call back and we'll be happy to help.

Customer: Sounds good. Thank you.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a great day!

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye!
