# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my latest statement and I'm seeing a charge that doesn't make sense.

Agent: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment... Got it. I'm looking at your account for... is this Jennifer?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Jennifer. I can see your account here. So you mentioned you have a question about a charge on your recent bill?

Customer: Right, so I've been with Frontier for about three years now, and my bill has always been around ninety-nine dollars a month for the fiber internet. That's the hundred-gig package. But this month I'm being charged one hundred and thirty-four dollars, and I have no idea why it went up thirty-five dollars. Did my service change or something?

Agent: Hmm, let me take a look at that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your billing history now... (pause) I see what happened here. It looks like you were on a promotional rate that expired at the end of last month.

Customer: A promotional rate? I don't remember being on any promotional rate. I thought that was just my regular price.

Agent: I understand. Let me explain what I'm seeing. When you signed up three years ago, you were enrolled in a 24-month promotional pricing on the hundred-gig fiber package. That promotion ended on September 30th, and as of October 1st, your rate adjusted to our standard pricing for that service level.

Customer: But... nobody told me about this. I never got an email or anything saying my rate was going to change. How is that fair?

Agent: I can definitely understand your frustration, Jennifer. That's a fair question. (pause) Let me check your account notes to see if we sent any notifications... (typing sounds) It looks like we did mail out a notice about sixty days prior to the rate change, but I completely understand that things like that can get lost or overlooked.

Customer: Well, I definitely didn't see anything. This is frustrating because I chose Frontier specifically because of that price. If I knew it was going to jump up like that, I might have gone with a different provider.

Agent: I hear you. I know that's disappointing. Let me see what options we have available. (typing sounds) So, one thing I can do is check if there are any current promotions that might apply to your account to help bring that rate back down.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I'd appreciate that.

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Alright, so looking at what we have available right now... we do have a promotion for existing customers on the hundred-gig package that would bring your rate down to one hundred and twelve dollars per month for the next twelve months.

Customer: One hundred and twelve? That's still thirteen dollars more than what I was paying.

Agent: I know, it's still an increase from your promotional rate. However, after the twelve months is up, that pricing would become your new standard rate, so you wouldn't see another increase at that point. The alternative would be to keep the standard rate of one hundred and thirty-four, which is what you're seeing now.

Customer: (sighs) This is... I mean, that's still not great. Is there anything else you can do? Like, I'm a loyal customer. I've been with you guys for three years without any issues. I've never missed a payment or anything.

Agent: That's great to hear, and I absolutely appreciate your loyalty. Let me see... (typing sounds) (pause) You know what, let me check with my supervisor to see if there's any additional courtesy credit or promotional offer we might be able to apply to your account.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I appreciate that.

Agent: I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I check into that. It should only be a couple of minutes.

Customer: Alright.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) (return) Thank you for holding, Jennifer. I was able to speak with my supervisor, and because you've been such a great customer, we can offer you that one-hundred-twelve-dollar rate for twenty-four months instead of just twelve months. That way you get a longer period at the reduced rate.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's a little better. But... I guess I'm just frustrated that this wasn't communicated better. I feel like I should have had more of a heads-up.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry that we didn't communicate this more clearly to you. You're absolutely right. And I do want to acknowledge that, even though you did receive a notice, it should have been more prominent in our communications. I can also add a one-time courtesy credit of ten dollars to your next bill as well, just to help offset some of this increase.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that... that does help. So just to clarify, I'm getting the one hundred and twelve rate for the next two years?

Agent: That's exactly right. The promotional rate of one hundred and twelve dollars per month for the next twenty-four months. And the ten-dollar credit will appear on your bill next month. After the twenty-four months, your rate will adjust to our standard pricing at that time, but we can discuss options again when that happens.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate you working with me on this. That's better than I expected.

Agent: You're very welcome. I really do appreciate your patience and your loyalty as a customer. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Oh, wait—so this new rate starts when? Is it retroactive or does it start next month?

Agent: Great question. The new promotional rate will start on your next billing cycle, which should be... (typing sounds) ...November 15th. So this month's bill at one hundred and thirty-four will be your last one at that rate, and then starting in November, you'll see the one hundred and twelve.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you, Marcus. I appreciate your help.

Agent: Thank you so much, Jennifer. We really do value your business. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to reach out anytime. You can also manage your account online at frontier.com if you need to make any changes. Thanks for choosing Frontier!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Have a good day.

Agent: You have a great day!
