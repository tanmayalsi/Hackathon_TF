# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. My internet bill jumped up like... I don't know, almost thirty dollars from last month. I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that, and I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. One second... Alright, I've got your account. I can see you're a valued customer with us for about four years now. So your bill increased, you said about thirty dollars?

Customer: Yeah, pretty much. Last month I paid $79.99 and this month it's showing $109.50. That's a huge jump. I haven't added any services or anything, so I'm confused.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Let me see what's changed on your account. (pause, typing) Okay, so I'm looking at your billing history here. You've been on our Frontier Fiber 500 plan for quite a while at $79.99 a month. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's the plan I signed up for two years ago. That was supposed to be locked in at that price, you know? They told me it wouldn't go up.

Agent: I see. Let me check the details of your agreement. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at your promotional rate history, and it looks like you were on a two-year promotional rate that actually expired about three months ago. The current rate for that plan in your area is $109.50.

Customer: (frustrated) What? Three months ago? Why didn't anyone tell me about this? I've been getting overcharged for three months?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize that you weren't notified directly about this rate change. The promotional period ending should have triggered a notification, but I can see that it may not have come through clearly. You're looking at additional charges for March, April, and May totaling around ninety dollars.

Customer: This is ridiculous. I specifically remember the guy telling me the price was locked in. I would have... I don't know, I would have shopped around if I knew this was coming.

Agent: (sympathetically) I hear you, and I really do apologize for that communication gap. Let me see what I can do to help make this right. Can I put you on a brief hold while I check what options are available to you?

Customer: (sighing) Yeah, okay. How long?

Agent: Just one moment. (hold music, approximately 20 seconds) Thank you for holding. Okay, so I've got a couple of options for you here. The first thing I can do is credit your account for the three months that you weren't notified—that would be about ninety dollars.

Customer: Okay... and what else?

Agent: Well, I can also look at getting you back on a promotional rate. We actually have a new promotion running right now. I can get you locked in for twelve months on our Fiber 500 plan at $89.99 a month, which is ten dollars less than the standard rate.

Customer: So I'd be paying more than my original rate?

Agent: Yes, unfortunately the promotional rates do change, and the pricing has shifted since your original agreement. However, this is currently our best available offer, and it would lock you in for a full year, so you wouldn't see any surprises.

Customer: (pause) ...Hm. And you're saying you can credit me for the three months I was overcharged?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. That's ninety dollars that would go back on your account either as a bill credit or, if you prefer, we could apply it toward a service credit to offset some of your future payments.

Customer: Yeah, okay, apply it as a bill credit. And put me on that new rate, I guess.

Agent: Perfect. I can definitely take care of that for you right now. (typing sounds) So I'm applying the ninety-dollar credit to your account effective immediately—you should see that reflected on your next bill. And I'm going to enroll you in the Fiber 500 promotion at $89.99 monthly for twelve months starting with your next billing cycle.

Customer: When does that take effect?

Agent: Your next billing cycle starts on June 1st, so your June bill will reflect the new rate of $89.99, and you'll see the credit applied as well. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour with all the details of the new agreement.

Customer: Alright. And this is locked in? It's not going to jump up again in a few months?

Agent: (firmly) This is locked in for twelve months. After that period, I would recommend giving us a call about thirty days before it expires so we can discuss options and make sure you're aware of any changes beforehand.

Customer: (slightly satisfied) Yeah, okay. I appreciate that. And I'm sorry for being frustrated earlier, it's just... unexpected bills, you know?

Agent: No, no, I completely understand. That's a totally reasonable reaction, and honestly, this should have been handled better on our end. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business. If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
