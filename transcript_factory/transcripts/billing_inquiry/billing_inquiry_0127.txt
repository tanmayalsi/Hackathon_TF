Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I just got my latest statement and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like thirty dollars from last month. What's going on?

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having concerns with your bill. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's... uh... (pause) 555-0147. That's the number tied to the service.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. Let me pull that up here. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account for [inaudible]. And I see your service is at... 4821 Maple Street, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned a charge you don't recognize and an increase. Let me take a look at your most recent bill. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing your bill from this month is $127.99, and last month was $97.50. Can you tell me which charge seems unfamiliar to you?

Customer: Well, there's like a $15 equipment fee that I've never seen before, and then the actual internet service jumped from $79.99 to $99.99. I didn't authorize any of that. I've been a customer for like three years with no problems, and suddenly this happens?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me explain what I'm seeing here. (pause) So the $15 equipment fee—that would be for the fiber gateway modem. Were you recently upgraded to a newer gateway model, or did you receive a new modem?

Customer: No, I... I don't think so? I mean, I've had the same modem the whole time. Nobody came out here or anything. This is the first I'm hearing about it.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful information. Let me look into that for you. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing a service call or equipment swap on your account recently. That's odd. As for the service rate increase, I do see that your promotional period ended on your account. You had an introductory rate of $79.99 for the first year, and that promotion expired last month.

Customer: Wait, what? A promotional rate? I was never told I had a promotional rate. When I signed up, they just told me the price was $79.99 a month. Nobody said it was gonna go up after a year.

Agent: (pause) I apologize for the confusion there. I can see why that would be frustrating. Unfortunately, promotional periods are sometimes not as clearly communicated as they should be. The good news is, I can definitely help you with both of these issues. First, let me investigate that equipment charge, because that shouldn't be on your bill if you haven't received any new equipment.

Customer: Okay, thank you. What about the rate increase though? Can you do anything about that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Well, let me see what options we have available. (pause) So, based on your account history and tenure as a customer, I can actually offer you a new promotional rate. How does $84.99 per month sound for the next twelve months? That's our current offer for existing customers.

Customer: That's better than the $99.99, but I mean... I was paying $79.99 before. Why should I have to pay more at all if the service is the same?

Agent: That's a fair question. I understand. The price adjustment does reflect some infrastructure improvements we've made in your area, and unfortunately, that impacts the standard rate. However, $84.99 is significantly better than the standard $99.99 rate, and it does come with a price lock for the next year. After that year, we can revisit your account again.

Customer: (pause) I mean... I guess that's better than what's on the bill now. But I'm not happy about it. And what about that equipment fee?

Agent: Right, so I'm going to escalate that equipment charge to our billing department to investigate. I'm not finding any record of new equipment being issued to your account, so it may be a billing error. It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for them to look into it, but I'm going to flag it as priority. In the meantime, I can issue you a courtesy credit for the $15 while we're investigating.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. (pause) So what do I need to do to get the new rate applied?

Agent: You don't need to do anything on your end. I'm going to apply that $84.99 promotional rate to your account right now, effective immediately. You should see that reflected on your next billing cycle. And like I said, I'm also crediting the $15 equipment charge pending the investigation. So your next bill should be $84.99 instead of $127.99.

Customer: Alright, I guess that works. When will I hear back about the equipment fee investigation?

Agent: You'll receive an email confirmation within the next two hours with a reference number for the billing investigation. Then our billing team will reach out within 24 to 48 hours with an update. If they confirm it was an error, the credit will remain on your account permanently.

Customer: Okay. Alright, I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course. I really do apologize for the lack of clarity on the promotional rate. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and thank you for being a loyal customer. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
