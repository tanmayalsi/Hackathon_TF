Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm pretty upset about it. My internet bill went up by like... thirty dollars? And I was never told about any price increase.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. Got you here. (pause) So you're saying you received a bill that was higher than expected. Can you tell me what you were paying before and what the new amount is?

Customer: Yeah, so for like the past year and a half, I've been paying $59.99 a month for the 500 megabit plan. This month it came through as $89.99. That's almost a fifty percent increase! And nobody called me, nobody emailed me, nothing. How is that even legal?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Michael. Let me take a look at what happened here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm seeing that your promotional rate did expire. You had an introductory offer that was set to end on... it looks like December 15th of this year. That rate expired, and you've now moved to our standard pricing for that service tier.

Customer: Wait, hold on. I never signed up for any "introductory offer." I've had this service forever. I mean, not forever, but for over a year.

Agent: I hear you. Let me just confirm—when you first signed up, was there any mention of a promotional period or an introductory rate?

Customer: (sighs) I... look, I don't know, maybe there was? It was like eighteen months ago. But if that was the case, somebody should have sent me a notice or something. You guys should have warned me before just jacking up my bill.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that. We are supposed to send notifications before a promotional rate expires. Let me check the notes here to see what happened. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing that a notification was sent via email on November 20th, but I don't have a record of it being opened. Sometimes those emails can end up in spam folders or...

Customer: Well, I didn't get it. And even if I did, that's not really the point. Why is it so expensive now? Is this what everyone pays, or...?

Agent: That's a great question. The $89.99 rate is our standard monthly rate for the 500 Mbps plan in your area. However, I want to make this right. Let me see what options I have available for you. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I can't extend your previous promotional rate, but I do have a loyalty offer I can apply to your account. I could get you back down to $69.99 per month for the next twelve months. Would that work for you?

Customer: So I'd still be paying ten dollars more than I was before?

Agent: Yes, unfortunately the promotional pricing we offered was below our standard rate. However, this loyalty offer is something I can apply to show our appreciation for being a customer. And after the twelve months, we could revisit your options.

Customer: (pause) I mean... that's better than ninety dollars, but I'm still not happy about it. Can you do any better?

Agent: Let me see... (typing sounds) I wish I could, but unfortunately that's the best offer I have in the system right now for your account. However, if you'd like, I can note on your account that you're interested in discussing options before this rate expires in twelve months, so we can contact you proactively next time.

Customer: Yeah, okay, fine. Can you at least make sure I get a notification this time? Like, call me or something?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll add a note to your account to send you both an email and make sure you receive a courtesy call thirty days before the rate is set to expire. And I'm going to go ahead and apply that $69.99 rate to your account effective immediately. So your next bill should reflect that change. It might take a billing cycle to show up, so you may see the higher rate one more time, but starting next month you should be good.

Customer: Okay... thank you for that at least. I appreciate you trying to help.

Agent: I really do apologize for the confusion, Michael. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. I hope this works out.

Agent: It will. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and thanks for calling. Have a great day.

Customer: You too, Derek. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
