Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and something doesn't look right.

Agent: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my service address phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here. (pause) Okay, I see your account. Your name is Michael Torres, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Alright, Michael. So you mentioned something doesn't look right with your bill. What specifically are you seeing?

Customer: Well, I've been a customer for about three years now, right? And my bill has always been around $89 a month for your Fiber 100 package. But this month it jumped up to $119. That's... that's like a $30 increase. I didn't change anything with my service, so I'm wondering what's going on.

Agent: I understand your concern. That would definitely catch my attention too. Let me take a look at what changed on your account. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so looking at your account history here, it looks like your promotional rate expired. You were enrolled in a new customer promotional period for 24 months at $89 a month, and that promotion ended this month.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't... I mean, nobody told me about that. How am I supposed to know my promotional rate was ending?

Agent: That's a fair question. Typically, we do send out notices before a promotional period ends. Let me check when that notice would have been sent out. (pause, typing) Okay, so it looks like a notice was mailed to you about 30 days ago informing you that your promotional rate would be expiring and what your new rate would be going into effect.

Customer: Well, I didn't get anything. I mean, I get a lot of mail, but I don't remember seeing anything from Frontier about this. And honestly, even if I did, shouldn't you guys contact me directly? Like, maybe a phone call or an email? A letter isn't exactly... I don't know, it feels like you're trying to slip this by people.

Agent: (pause) I hear what you're saying, Michael, and I appreciate your feedback. You know, I understand why this feels like it came out of nowhere. Unfortunately, the promotion did end, so the rate increase is accurate on your bill. But let me see what we can do for you here. Do you have a few minutes?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, I'm not happy about this, but yeah, I have time.

Agent: Great. So I'm going to be honest with you—the $119 rate is our standard rate for the Fiber 100 service in your area. However, because you've been such a loyal customer for three years, I may have some options for you. Let me check what promotions we have available right now. (typing sounds, longer pause) Okay, so I've got a couple of things here. We have a six-month promotional rate of $99 a month, which would get you a little relief without changing your service. Or, if you're open to it, we could upgrade you to our Fiber 200 package, which would actually be $104 a month for 12 months, and you'd get double the speeds.

Customer: So either way, I'm paying more than I was before?

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. Technically, yes, the rate would be higher than your original promotional rate, but—

Customer: But I wasn't asking for a speed upgrade. I was happy with what I had. I just don't feel like I should be penalized because a promotion ended without me really knowing about it. Like, I've been paying you guys for three years. It seems like there should be some loyalty discount or something.

Agent: (pause) You know what, Michael, I hear you. And I want to help make this right. Let me... let me see if I can do something a little different here. What if I extended a promotion for you—how about $94 a month for 12 months? That's not quite the $89 you were paying, but it's a meaningful discount from the regular rate.

Customer: (pause) That's... better. But I still feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick compared to what I was getting before.

Agent: I absolutely understand your perspective. And you're right that it's not quite the same deal. But I do want to make sure we're taking care of you as a long-term customer. If you'd like, I can also credit your account $30 for this month to offset this surprise increase. That way, your first bill at the new rate would just be $89, the same as you've been paying. Would that help?

Customer: (pause) Okay... yeah, actually, that would help. That's fair.

Agent: Great. So let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) I'm going to apply a $30 credit to your account right now, and I'm going to enroll you in the 12-month promotional rate of $94 a month starting next month. So this month, you'll see a credit applied, and then starting in January, your monthly rate will be $94.

Customer: Okay, when will I see that credit?

Agent: The credit should post within 24 to 48 hours. You'll see it reflected on your next bill, and it'll show up in your online account portal pretty quickly too.

Customer: Alright. And just to be clear, this is locked in for 12 months at $94, right? There's not going to be any surprise after that?

Agent: Well, after the 12 months, your rate would go back to standard pricing unless we have another promotion available at that time. But what I'd recommend is, about 30 days before your 12-month period ends, you give us a call back, and we can discuss your options then. Hopefully, we'll have something available for you at that point.

Customer: Okay, I mean, I'd prefer if you could just lock it in longer or something, but... I guess that's better than nothing. I'll try to mark that on my calendar or something.

Agent: I appreciate your understanding, Michael. And I really do apologize for the confusion with the notice. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business. You have a great rest of your day, okay?

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
