Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and... I don't know, something doesn't look right. My bill went up like thirty dollars out of nowhere.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up right now. Just give me one second... Alright, I've got your account here. I'm seeing your name is Michael Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you're noticing an increase on your bill this month. Can you tell me what your normal monthly charge usually is?

Customer: Well, it's been like 79.99 a month for the last... I dunno, eight months or so? And this month it jumped to 109.99. That's almost forty bucks more, not thirty. I just looked at it again.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so that is a significant jump. Let me look into what might have changed on your account. (typing sounds) I'm seeing here that you're on our Gigabit Fiber plan. Is that the package you signed up for originally?

Customer: Yeah, I got the promotional rate when I signed up. It was supposed to be 79.99 for, like, a year or something. But then I thought that promotion was supposed to last longer than eight months?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me look at the details of your promotion here. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing the promotion was for twelve months at $79.99 per month for Gigabit Fiber service. That promotion should have expired... looks like it expired just this month, on the 15th. So your regular rate is $109.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me that's just the regular price? Like, that's what I'm gonna be paying now?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. Once your promotional period ends, you move to the standard monthly rate for that service tier. So at $109.99, that's the regular price for our Gigabit Fiber plan in your area.

Customer: (frustrated) That doesn't seem right. That's a huge jump. Why didn't anyone tell me about this? I should've gotten some kind of notification or something before the price just doubled.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize that the transition wasn't as clear as it could have been. Typically, customers do receive notification letters about promotional rate endings about 30 days in advance. Let me check if that was sent to you... (typing sounds) I'm not seeing a delivery confirmation in our system that you received that notice. That's on us, and I'm sorry about that.

Customer: So what am I supposed to do now? I can't really afford to pay that much. That's like $1,300 a year more than what I was paying.

Agent: I hear you, and I want to help make this right. Let me see what options we have available for you. (pause) So one thing I can do is look at what current promotional offers we might have for your account. We do have some competitive packages available right now. Can I ask... are you looking to keep the Gigabit speeds, or would you be open to a different service tier?

Customer: I mean... I use it for streaming and stuff, and my wife works from home, so we need decent speeds. But I don't necessarily need the absolute top tier if it's gonna save me money.

Agent: That makes sense. So we do have our Ultra Fiber plan at 500 Mbps, which would be more than sufficient for streaming and remote work. That package is currently running $69.99 a month with a twelve-month promotional rate. That would actually save you ten dollars a month compared to what you were originally paying.

Customer: (interested) Really? So that would be $69.99?

Agent: Yes, and that comes with our standard equipment and support. The speeds are more than adequate for what you described. So that would bring you down from the $109.99 you're looking at now.

Customer: That sounds better, but like... can I ask why I wasn't told about this stuff? I feel like I got kind of... taken advantage of here.

Agent: (pause) That's a fair point, and I don't blame you for feeling that way. We should have been clearer with the notification on the promotional expiration. What I can do is apply this new promotional rate for you going forward. I can also credit your account for the difference between the promotional rate and the regular rate for this billing cycle, since you didn't receive proper notice. So that would be a credit of about thirty dollars to offset that increase you saw.

Customer: Okay... (pause) I mean, that helps. I appreciate that. So you're gonna switch me to the Ultra Fiber plan?

Agent: I can absolutely do that for you. Let me just go ahead and process that change. (typing sounds) This will take effect on your next billing cycle, which starts on the 22nd of next month. And I'm also applying that $30 credit to your current bill right now. (pause) Alright, I've gone ahead and made those changes. You should see the credit on your account within the next 24 hours, and then starting next month you'll see the $69.99 charge with the promotional rate locked in for twelve months.

Customer: Okay, thank you. So I'm gonna get the $30 credit and then it'll be $69.99 going forward?

Agent: That's exactly right. And I want to make sure you know that we will send you another notification about 30 days before this next promotion expires, so you won't be caught off guard again.

Customer: (relieved) Alright, that's good to know. I appreciate you working with me on this, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. We appreciate your business, and we hope you continue to enjoy great speeds and reliable service. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
