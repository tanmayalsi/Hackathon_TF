Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize. It's like... it went up like thirty bucks out of nowhere.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And what's your name?

Customer: It's Jennifer. Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: Great, Jennifer. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your account now. So you mentioned a charge increase of about thirty dollars?

Customer: Yeah, like, my bill was usually around $89 a month, and this month it came to $119. That's a huge jump. I haven't changed anything with my service or whatever, so I don't know where this is coming from.

Agent: (typing sounds) I totally understand your concern. Let me take a look at what's on your account. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing here that... it looks like you were on a promotional rate that expired. You had a twelve-month promotional offer for fiber internet at $89.99, and that promo period ended on the 15th of last month.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't... I mean, I knew there was a promo, but nobody told me it was ending. And $120? That's ridiculous. Why would it jump that much?

Agent: I completely understand that's frustrating. So the promotion has expired, and you're now on our standard Frontier Fiber 500 plan, which is $119.99 per month. That's our regular pricing for that speed tier.

Customer: But that's crazy. Like, I got this service because of the deal in the first place. I can't afford to pay that much every month. What am I supposed to do here?

Agent: Well, Jennifer, I hear you. Let me see what I can do for you. (pause) I do see that you've been a good customer—you've been with us for about two years now, no missed payments. Let me check if there are any current promotions I can apply to your account.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I mean, I really liked the service, but that price is just... it's too much.

Agent: (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, so I'm looking at our current offers. We actually do have a promotion running right now—I can get you back down to $99.99 a month for the same Fiber 500 service, and this one's for a twelve-month term as well.

Customer: So that's $99.99? That's better than $120, but it's still more than what I was paying before.

Agent: I know, and I understand. The previous promotion was a limited-time offer to attract new customers, so unfortunately I can't bring you back to that exact rate. However, the $99.99 is the best rate I'm able to offer you right now, and it's a $20 savings from the regular price.

Customer: (sighs) So I'm just stuck paying more because my promo ended?

Agent: I understand how that feels. The way these promotions work is they're designed to be temporary to help with the initial setup, and then customers go to our standard rates. But I really have applied our best current promotion to your account. Plus, you're getting great speeds with the Fiber 500—that's really reliable service.

Customer: Yeah, I mean, the service has been good. I guess I just didn't expect to see such a big jump on the bill. But okay, so if I agree to this, it's $99.99 for another twelve months?

Agent: That's correct. $99.99 a month for twelve months. And this promotion would be effective immediately if you'd like me to apply it.

Customer: And then what happens after that? Do I get a warning this time or something?

Agent: That's a good question. About 30 days before your promotion ends, you'll receive a notification—either by email or mail—letting you know that your promotional rate is expiring. We'll also include information about any other offers that might be available to you at that time. So you won't be caught off guard again.

Customer: Okay, that sounds better. Yeah, let's go with it. Apply whatever promotion. I don't really have a choice at this point.

Agent: I appreciate that, Jennifer. Let me just confirm the details with you. I'm applying the Frontier Fiber 500 promotional rate of $99.99 per month for a twelve-month term. Your billing cycle will remain the same, and this will show up on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, sounds good.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've got that applied to your account now. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I wish I had gotten a heads-up about the price increase, you know? Like, a phone call or something.

Agent: I hear you, and that's great feedback. We do try to send notifications, but I understand they don't always get through or get noticed. I'm really glad I could get you a better rate today. Your new rate is $99.99, and again, you'll get that 30-day notice before anything changes in the future.

Customer: Alright, thank you. I appreciate you helping me out.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
