# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and there's a charge on here that shouldn't be there, or... I don't know, something's wrong with my pricing.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. The phone number, I mean.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Patterson.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, I've got your account here. I can see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. What seems to be the issue with your bill?

Customer: Well, okay, so I've been a customer for like... three years? And my bill has always been $79.99 a month. But this month—I just got the bill yesterday—and it's now $99.99. That's a twenty dollar increase out of nowhere. Nobody called me, nobody sent me anything in the mail about this until after I was already charged.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Mr. Patterson. That would be unexpected. Let me take a look at your account history here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing that your promotional pricing did expire. It looks like you were on an introductory rate for the first 24 months of service, and that expired about... three months ago, actually.

Customer: Three months ago? But my bill didn't change three months ago. It's been the same the whole time until now.

Agent: (pause) That's a great question. Let me look into this a little further. (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like there was a system delay on our end. Your promotional period should have ended back in May, but the billing didn't actually process the rate change until this month due to a... a technical issue on our system. I apologize for that confusion.

Customer: So you're telling me it's been three months and you're just now charging me the difference? That doesn't seem fair. Why didn't anyone catch this before?

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize. That should have been caught and communicated to you much sooner. I can see here that there's also a backcharge on your account for those three months at the higher rate. Is that what you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, there's like a $60 adjustment charge or something. On top of the new monthly bill. So I'm looking at paying like $160 this month total.

Agent: I completely understand why you'd be upset about that. (pause) So here's what I can do for you. First, I'm going to waive that backcharge adjustment completely. That's our error, and you shouldn't be penalized for a system delay on our end.

Customer: Okay... okay, that's good. But what about the rate increase itself? I mean, I signed up for a reason. The price was good. Now it's... it's almost $100 a month.

Agent: Right. So the good news is, we do have some options. Your promotional period has ended, but I can actually look at putting you on a retention rate. Since you've been such a loyal customer for three years, I have the ability to offer you a discounted rate. How does $84.99 a month sound?

Customer: That's still higher than what I was paying.

Agent: I understand. The introductory rate you had was specifically for new customers, so we can't reinstate that exactly. But $84.99 is our best rate for a loyalty customer, and it's significantly better than the standard $99.99. Plus, you're still getting the same Fiber 500 speeds—no changes to your service.

Customer: (pause) How long would that be good for?

Agent: That rate would be locked in for 12 months. After that, we'd need to revisit, but I'd make a note on your account that you're a valued long-term customer, so we'd work with you at that time.

Customer: And you're definitely waiving that $60 backcharge?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. That's already taken care of. That won't appear on your bill. So your next bill should be $84.99, and then you're all set going forward.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I... I guess that works. I'm still not thrilled about the increase at all, but at least it's better than $99.99.

Agent: I really do appreciate your business, Mr. Patterson, and again, I apologize for the delay in communicating this change. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... maybe someone should reach out to your other long-term customers who might have experienced the same issue. I'm sure I'm not the only one who got surprised by this.

Agent: That's actually really valuable feedback. I'm going to make a note of that on your account, and I'll make sure it gets to our billing department. You make a good point.

Customer: Alright. Thanks for working with me on this, Derek.

Agent: My pleasure. Thank you for being a Frontier customer. Is there a number we can reach you at if we have any follow-up questions?

Customer: The number you have should be fine—555-0147.

Agent: Perfect. That's the same number on file, so we're all set. Have a great day, Mr. Patterson.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye-bye.
