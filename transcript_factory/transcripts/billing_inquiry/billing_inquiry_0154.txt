Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Actually, there are two things. First, my bill went up like fifteen dollars from last month, and I have no idea why. And then there's this... (rustling of papers) ...this $89.99 charge for something called "Professional Installation Adjustment."

Agent: I'm sorry you're experiencing billing concerns. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. Just one moment. (pause) Alright, I've got your account here. I can see your service address is on Maple Drive in Salem?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So let me address both of those concerns. First, regarding the price increase—can you tell me, when did your promotional rate expire? Do you remember signing up for any kind of introductory offer?

Customer: I mean... yeah, I signed up like two years ago, and I think I had some kind of deal going on. But that should have been way longer than two years, right? I feel like I was getting like $79.99 a month, and now it's like $94.99. That's... that seems like a lot.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me see what I have here. (typing sounds) Yes, I'm seeing that your promotional rate of $79.99 for our Gig Fiber package ended on March 15th. After promotional periods end, the service does move to our standard rate, which is $94.99 for that same package. It should have been communicated to you before that happened. Do you recall receiving any notifications about that?

Customer: I mean, maybe? I don't know. I get so many emails. But like, nobody called me or anything. This is the first I'm hearing about it officially, and I'm pretty upset about it because I was happy with what I was paying.

Agent: I completely understand. I apologize that the transition wasn't clearer to you. Let me see what options we have. (pause) So you've been a customer for two years and have been on-time with your payments, which is great. I can see that here. Unfortunately, I can't reinstate the promotional rate since it's technically expired, but what I can do is offer you an alternative promotion. We currently have a rate of $84.99 for the same Gig Fiber service, and that would lock in for twelve months from today.

Customer: That's... that's better than $94.99, but I'm still paying five more dollars than I was before. Why can't you just keep me at the original rate? I've been a good customer.

Agent: You know what, that's fair feedback. Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm going to note your account that you're a longtime customer with excellent payment history, and I'm going to apply a one-time account credit of $45 to your current bill. That'll basically cover the difference for three months. And I can also lock in that $84.99 rate for twelve months. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's... that's a little better. I still don't love it, but okay. Now what about this $89.99 charge for the "Professional Installation Adjustment"? I didn't have anyone come out. Why am I being charged that?

Agent: (typing sounds) That's a great question. Let me pull up your service history. (pause) Hmm, I'm not seeing any service calls or technician visits in the last... (pause) ...actually, in the last two years. Can you tell me when you first noticed this charge?

Customer: It's on this bill. The bill I just got today. I don't remember paying this before, so I think it's new.

Agent: Right. This might be an error on our part. (pause) I'm pulling up some notes here... Oh, I see. I think I might know what happened. There was a system update we did in early March, and it looks like some old installation fees from deactivated services got incorrectly re-applied to active accounts. I sincerely apologize for that. This charge should not be on your account. I'm going to remove that right now. (typing sounds)

Customer: Wait, so you're removing it? Just like that?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. It was an error on our system. There's no reason for that charge to be there. I'm removing it effective immediately, and you'll see that credit on your next bill. (pause) Okay, I've removed that $89.99 charge, and you have the $45 credit I applied earlier for the rate adjustment.

Customer: Okay, well... that's good. So just to confirm, my rate is going to be $84.99 going forward?

Agent: That's correct. $84.99 per month for the next twelve months for your Gig Fiber service. And you have the $45 credit applied to this current bill.

Customer: And the $89.99 charge is completely gone?

Agent: Completely gone. It shouldn't appear on any future bills. (pause) Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. I mean, I'm still not thrilled about the increase from two years ago, but at least we got it figured out.

Agent: I really do appreciate your patience, and I apologize again for the confusion around the promotional rate ending. You should have been notified more clearly about that. We value your business, and I hope the credits and the locked-in rate help make this right. If you have any issues going forward, please don't hesitate to give us a call back.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
