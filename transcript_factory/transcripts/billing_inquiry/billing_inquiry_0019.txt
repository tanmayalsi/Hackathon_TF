Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. It went up like forty dollars from last month, and I want to know what that's about.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under James Patterson.

Agent: Perfect, Mr. Patterson. I see your account here. (pause) So you're saying your bill increased by about forty dollars?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. Last month I was paying like $89.99, and this month it's showing $129.99. That's almost fifty percent more. I haven't changed anything with my service or added anything, so I'm really confused about where this is coming from.

Agent: I completely understand why that would be concerning. Let me take a look at what changed here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing... ah, I think I see what happened. It looks like your promotional pricing period ended. You were on our introductory rate for twelve months, and that expired at the end of last billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, what? No one told me about that. I mean, I don't remember seeing anything about the price going up. You guys should have to notify people before you just... I don't know, jack up the price like that.

Agent: You know, that's a fair point, and I apologize. We should have sent you a notice about the rate change. Actually, let me check—did you receive anything in the mail or email about this in the last month or so?

Customer: (pause) I mean... maybe? I get so much junk mail and emails, honestly. But that's not really the point, is it? The point is I signed up for internet service, not for some bait-and-switch situation where they hook you in with a low price and then you get the surprise bill.

Agent: I hear you, and I understand your frustration. That's definitely not our intention with these promotional rates. They are disclosed in the terms, but I'll be the first to admit that it's easy to miss. The good news is that I can help you explore some other options here. (typing sounds) Are you currently on our Fiber 500 plan?

Customer: I think so? I don't really pay attention to the exact tier. It's the fast internet you have around here. I get good speeds, so I've been happy with the service itself. It's just this bill thing that's got me upset.

Agent: Right, and that's great that you're happy with the service quality. So you are on the Fiber 500, and the new rate of $129.99 is actually our standard rate for that tier. However, I do have a couple of options I can offer you.

Customer: Okay, what kind of options?

Agent: Well, first of all, I can offer you a new promotional rate. We have a current promotion running for existing customers where I could get you back down to... (pause) let me see here... $99.99 per month for the next twelve months. That's a ten dollar increase from your original rate, but it's significantly less than the $129.99 you're seeing now.

Customer: Okay, that's better, but it's still more than what I was paying before. Can't you just keep me at the original rate?

Agent: I wish I could, Mr. Patterson. Unfortunately, the promotional pricing is only available for the initial term. After that, we do adjust to our standard rates. But what I can do is lock you into this $99.99 rate for another full year, and I can also make a note on your account that you'd like to be contacted before any future rate changes so you're not surprised again.

Customer: (pause) I mean, I guess that's... okay. But I'm still frustrated about this. Like, how is this legal? Don't you have to warn people or something?

Agent: It's a legitimate question. We do disclose it in the service agreement and terms of service that customers agree to, and we do attempt to notify customers by mail. But I completely understand the frustration. To your point, we could definitely do a better job communicating about this. And I really do appreciate you calling in about it, because feedback like yours does matter.

Customer: Alright, well... I appreciate you saying that. So if I take this $99.99 rate, that starts with my next bill?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, exactly. I'm applying that promotional rate to your account right now. It will be effective on your next billing cycle, which should be... (pause) the 15th of next month. So you should see the adjustment then.

Customer: Okay. And you said you'd put a note on my account about contacting me before future rate changes?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I'm putting that in the notes right now. (typing sounds) Okay, got it. You're all set, Mr. Patterson. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. I really do apologize again for the surprise on the bill. We appreciate your business with Frontier, and thanks for being a customer. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: Nope, that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
