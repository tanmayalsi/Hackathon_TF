Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and something doesn't add up.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... alright, I've got you. I'm showing this is for the service at 2891 Maple Street in Bozeman?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So what's the issue you're seeing on your bill?

Customer: Well, I've been a customer for... I think it's been almost three years now? And my bill has always been $79.99 a month for your Gig internet plan. But this month—this month I got charged $94.99. That's like a fifteen-dollar jump, and nobody told me about any price increase.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at your account here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing... yes, there was a price adjustment that went into effect on your account this month. The Gig plan in your area did increase by $15 a month, effective with your current billing cycle.

Customer: But why wasn't I notified? I mean, that's a pretty significant increase. I feel like companies usually send something in the mail or give you a heads up before they just charge you more money.

Agent: That's a fair question. We do send notification letters to customers about pricing changes, typically about 30 days in advance. Let me check to see if we have confirmation that yours was sent... (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so according to our records, a notice was mailed to your account address on... March 18th. So that would've been about a month and a half ago now.

Customer: (sighs) I mean, I don't know. I didn't see anything. Is it possible it got lost in the mail? I get a lot of junk mail, so... it could've happened.

Agent: It's definitely possible. Mail does get delayed or misplaced sometimes. I apologize if you didn't receive the notification. That said, the price increase is something that's been applied to all customers in your service area on that particular plan.

Customer: Okay, so... is there anything you can do? Can I get a credit or something? Or maybe you can talk me through other options?

Agent: Let me see what I can do for you here. (typing sounds) Um, unfortunately, I don't have the ability to reverse a price increase that's already been applied. However... what I can do is I can explore some other plan options that might work better for your needs right now. Are you currently using the gigabit speeds, or would a lower-tier plan work for you?

Customer: Well, I mean, I'm using it. But I'm not like a heavy user or anything. I'm mostly just streaming Netflix and browsing the internet. My roommate uses it sometimes too. So... I don't really know if I need gigabit speeds, to be honest.

Agent: Okay, so that actually gives us some good options. We have our 300 Mbps plan, which would be plenty for streaming and regular internet use. That's currently $59.99 a month. We also have a 500 Mbps option at $69.99. Both of those would save you some money compared to the new Gig price.

Customer: (pause) Really? So I could drop down and save money?

Agent: Yeah, you'd actually save about $25 a month with the 300 plan or about $15 a month with the 500 plan. The speeds would still be more than enough for streaming and general browsing.

Customer: Hmm. But if I downgrade, is there going to be any penalty or anything?

Agent: No, there's no penalty for changing plans. And if you do downgrade and you find that you need the higher speeds again, you can always upgrade back. There wouldn't be any fees for that either.

Customer: I mean... that's good to know. Can I think about it? I want to talk to my roommate about it first since he uses the internet too, and then I'll probably want to switch to one of those lower plans.

Agent: Absolutely, that makes sense. Do you want me to make a note on your account so that when you call back, we can get you switched over quickly?

Customer: Yeah, that'd be great.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm putting a note here that you're interested in downgrading to either the 300 or 500 Mbps plan and that you'll be calling back to confirm. Is there a timeframe you're thinking? Like, do you want to make this change for next month's billing cycle?

Customer: Um, yeah, probably within the next week or so. I'll give my roommate a call today or tomorrow.

Agent: Perfect. And just so you know, if you want to make the change after you've talked to him, you can call back anytime, or you could also make the change online through your account portal if you prefer.

Customer: Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah, I might just do it online then. That would be easier.

Agent: That's totally fine. Either way works. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course. I'm sorry again that you didn't receive the notification about the price increase, but I'm glad we could find a better option for you. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and feel free to reach out if you have any other questions.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Take care!
