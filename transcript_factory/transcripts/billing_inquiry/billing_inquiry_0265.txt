Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I just got my bill and... I don't understand what happened. My internet bill went up like thirty dollars a month, and I wasn't told about any of this.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. And honestly, I've been a customer for like five years now, and I've never had any issues, but this is ridiculous.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling up your account here... I completely understand your concern. Let me just verify your information first. Is this Robert Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, thank you. And I'm seeing your account here. So you're on our Frontier Fiber 500 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I pay... well, I was paying $79.99 a month, and now it says $109.99. That's a thirty-dollar increase, Marcus. Can you explain to me why that happened?

Agent: (pause) I completely see why you'd be upset about that. Let me pull up the details on your account to see what changed. (typing sounds) Okay, so... I'm looking at your account history here. It looks like your promotional rate expired.

Customer: Promotional rate? I was never told I was on a promotional rate. I thought that was just my normal bill.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for the confusion. So when you signed up five years ago, you were enrolled in an introductory rate of $79.99 for twelve months. After that period ended, the rate adjusted to our standard pricing, which is $109.99 for that speed tier.

Customer: Wait, hold on. Five years ago? I've been paying $79.99 for five years straight. That's not twelve months. That doesn't make sense.

Agent: That's a really good question. Let me look more carefully at your account here. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm actually seeing something interesting. It looks like... okay, so you were automatically re-enrolled in another promotional period after that first year expired. So you've actually been on a series of promotional rates this entire time.

Customer: (frustrated) That's... I mean, I never signed up for anything after the first time. Nobody called me. I didn't get any emails. I just paid the same bill every month.

Agent: I hear you, and I apologize that you weren't notified more clearly about this. So it looks like your most recent promotional period ended on the 15th of last month, which is why you're seeing the rate increase on your current bill.

Customer: Okay, but nobody told me. If I'd known this was coming, I could have... I don't know, I could have called beforehand or something. You guys should have sent me a notice or an email or something.

Agent: (pause) You're absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize for that. We should have notified you in advance. Let me see what I can do to help make this right. Give me just one moment.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: (typing sounds, longer pause) So I'm looking at your account, and I do have some options available to me. Because of your five-year tenure with us and the fact that you weren't properly notified about the rate increase, I can offer you a new promotional rate.

Customer: Okay, what rate are we talking about?

Agent: I can get you back to $89.99 for the next twelve months. That's a $20 reduction from the standard rate. Does that sound better?

Customer: So I'd still be paying ten dollars more than what I was paying before?

Agent: Yes, unfortunately. The standard rate is $109.99, so $89.99 is still... (pause) ...it's a discount from where you are now, but it's above your previous rate. Let me see if I have any other options.

Customer: I mean, I appreciate it, but it doesn't really feel fair. I've been a good customer. I pay on time. I've never had any complaints about the service. And you guys just... raise my bill without telling me?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and you're right. You have been a loyal customer. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to check with my supervisor to see if we have any other options available. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (brief hold music plays)

Agent: Thank you for holding. So I spoke with my supervisor, and because of your account history and the circumstances here, I can actually extend you a special offer. I can put you on a two-year rate lock at $84.99 per month. That's the best I can do for you.

Customer: (pause) Two years?

Agent: Yes, for a full two years, that rate won't change. No increases, no surprises.

Customer: (exhales) Okay, so that's still five dollars more than I was paying before...

Agent: I know it's not perfect, but it does protect you from any further increases for the next twenty-four months, and it's significantly below the standard rate. And again, I really do apologize that we didn't handle the notification better.

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, okay. I guess... I mean, at least there's something. But in the future, you guys really need to notify customers about this stuff. I shouldn't have to call in to find out about a rate increase.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I'm going to make a note on your account about this. We take your feedback very seriously. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... make sure that rate goes through, okay? I don't want any surprises next month.

Agent: I promise you won't have any surprises. I'm applying that right now to your account. You'll see the new rate on your next billing cycle, which should be... (typing sounds) ...in about ten days. You'll receive an updated bill showing the new rate of $84.99.

Customer: Okay, thank you for at least trying to help.

Agent: Thank you so much for being a customer with us for the past five years, Robert. We really do appreciate your business. Is there anything else I can assist with?

Customer: No, that's everything. Have a good day.

Agent: You too. Thank you for calling Frontier, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
