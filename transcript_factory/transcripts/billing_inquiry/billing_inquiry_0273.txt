Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my internet bill went up like thirty bucks since last month. I need to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry you're experiencing that concern. I'd be happy to look into this for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And can I get your name please?

Customer: It's Michael Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got your account here. Let me take a look at your recent charges. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing your bill from this month is $127.99, is that the one you're looking at?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. Last month it was like ninety-eight dollars. That's almost a thirty dollar jump. I haven't added any services or anything. What changed?

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. Let me break down what I'm seeing here. You've got your Frontier Fiber Gigabit internet at $79.99, which is your standard service. And then I'm seeing a charge here for... (pause, typing) ...a modem rental at $12.99.

Customer: A modem rental? I own my modem. I bought my own modem like two years ago.

Agent: Okay, that's good information. Do you have the model number handy by any chance?

Customer: Uh, not right now. I'd have to go look at it. But I definitely own it. I'm not renting anything from you guys.

Agent: I believe you. Let me see if I can find any notes on the account about that. (pause, typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not seeing where that modem was provisioned as customer-owned. It's possible there was a billing error, or... do you remember if you activated the modem yourself or if someone from Frontier helped you set it up?

Customer: I mean, I activated it myself. I plugged it in, registered it on your website. That was it.

Agent: Okay. And then separately, I'm also seeing a charge here for a second IP address block at $14.99. Do you subscribe to that service?

Customer: No! What is that? I don't even know what a second IP address block is. Why would I be charged for that?

Agent: Let me look into this a bit more. (pause) It looks like this charge was added to your account on the 15th of last month. Do you recall if you made any changes to your account around that time?

Customer: No, I didn't do anything. I just use my internet. I'm not doing anything technical. This doesn't make sense. Are you guys just adding random charges now?

Agent: I assure you, Michael, we don't intentionally add charges without service. But I do see what might've happened here. It appears there was a promotional period that expired on your account. You were locked in at $79.99 for twelve months, and that promotion ended, so... (pause) actually, wait. Let me look at this again because that doesn't quite account for the full increase.

Customer: (frustrated) So what are you saying? My promotion ended and now I'm being charged for stuff I'm not even using?

Agent: I apologize for the confusion. What I'm seeing is that the modem rental and the IP address block may have been provisioned in error. I want to make this right. I'm going to remove both of those charges from your account right now, which will bring your bill back down to $79.99, which is what you should be paying.

Customer: Okay, but will you remove them from my balance too? Or just going forward?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me... (typing sounds) I'm going to credit your account for this month's charges on those two items. That's $27.98 coming back to you. You should see that reflected on your next bill.

Customer: (less hostile) Alright, okay. And the modem thing—will that stay off, or is it going to pop back on my bill?

Agent: No, it won't come back on. I'm updating your account notes right now to indicate that you have a customer-owned modem, and I'm blacklisting that rental charge so it won't happen again. I'm also removing the secondary IP address block from your services entirely since that wasn't something you requested.

Customer: Good. I appreciate that. But I want to make sure—my internet speed isn't going to be affected by any of this, right? I'm getting the gigabit speeds I'm supposed to be getting.

Agent: Not at all. Removing those charges won't impact your service whatsoever. You'll still get your full Frontier Fiber Gigabit speeds. Those were just billing items that shouldn't have been on your account.

Customer: (pause) Alright. Well, thank you for fixing that. I was pretty aggravated when I saw that bill.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm genuinely sorry that happened. I wish it hadn't been added in the first place. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you taking care of it.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. I'm going to email you a confirmation of the changes we made today, and you can also see everything updated in your online account within the next 24 hours. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Have a great day!
