Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I noticed my internet bill went up like... thirty dollars. I've had the same plan for like two years and nothing changed on my end, so I'm not sure why this happened.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. Thank you. (pause) Okay, I've got your account here. I can see your service address is on Maple Street in... Boise, Idaho. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So I'm looking at your current bill here, and I can see what you're referring to. Your plan was previously $59.99 a month, and as of this billing cycle, it's now $89.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yes! Exactly. That's like almost thirty dollars more. Why would that happen? Did you guys change my plan without asking me?

Agent: I completely understand why that would be frustrating. Let me see... (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at the notes here. It looks like you had a promotional rate that expired. You've been on that promo rate for twenty-four months, and it ended at the end of last month.

Customer: But... I didn't agree to that. Like, nobody told me it was going to go up. I would've remembered something like that.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, promotional rates do come with an end date, and that information would have been included in the paperwork when you first signed up. However, I totally get that it's not always easy to remember those details, especially after two years. Let me see what options I can explore for you here.

Customer: Okay... well, I mean, I'm not trying to be difficult. I just... I've been a customer for, what, like five years now? And I've never had any issues. I always pay on time. It just seems like the loyalty should count for something, you know?

Agent: (pause) You know what, Jennifer? That's a really fair point, and I appreciate your loyalty. Let me check what promotions we currently have available. (typing sounds) Okay, so I do see that we have a new customer promotion for $49.99 a month for the first twelve months on our 100 Mbps fiber plan. But I also want to see if there's anything I can do for you as a loyal customer...

Customer: Wait, $49.99? That's even less than what I was paying before the increase.

Agent: Right, but that's the new customer rate. (pause) Let me... let me see what I can do here. Can you hold for just one moment? I want to check with my supervisor to see if we can apply something similar for you.

Customer: Um, okay. Sure.

Agent: Thank you. (hold music plays briefly) (30 seconds pass)

Agent: Jennifer? Thanks for holding.

Customer: Yeah, I'm still here.

Agent: Great. So I spoke with my supervisor, and because you've been such a great customer for five years with no missed payments, I can offer you our loyalty rate. We can get you back down to $64.99 a month for the next twelve months. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) So I'd still be paying five dollars more than I was before the increase, but... I mean, that's better than thirty dollars more. Can I ask what happens after the twelve months?

Agent: That's a great question. So after the twelve months, your rate would go back to the standard rate at that time. But we can definitely discuss renewal options when that comes up. Plus, I want to make sure you're aware that once you commit to this loyalty rate, I'll make a note on your account so we can reach out to you before it expires and make sure you're taken care of.

Customer: (pause) Alright. Yeah, I think that's... that's fair. Um, when would that take effect?

Agent: Excellent. So I can apply that rate retroactively to your current billing cycle. You should see the credit applied within the next two to three business days, and then starting with your next bill, you'll see the new rate of $64.99. I'll also send you an email confirmation of this adjustment.

Customer: Okay, that's great. Thank you. I appreciate you working with me on that.

Agent: Of course, Jennifer. I really do appreciate your business, and I apologize again for the frustration with the rate increase. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for calling Frontier, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
