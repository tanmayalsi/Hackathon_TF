Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I'm pretty frustrated, honestly. My internet bill went up like thirty dollars a month, and nobody told me about this.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I get the name on the account please?

Customer: It's under Jennifer Walsh.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, Jennifer. Let me pull that up here... Okay, I've got your account. I can see your last bill was... (pause) $79.99, and your current bill is showing $109.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yes! Exactly. That's almost a thirty-dollar jump. I've been with Frontier for like four years now and my bill's always been steady. What changed? Did you guys change your plans or something?

Agent: I understand your concern. Let me look at what happened here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history. It looks like you were on our promotional rate for new customers, which was locked in at $79.99 a month. That promotion expired at the end of last month, so your account automatically moved to our standard Fiber 300 plan, which is $109.99 monthly.

Customer: Wait, wait. So you're telling me this was just... automatic? Nobody sent me a notice or anything?

Agent: (pause) Let me check that for you. We should have sent a notice about thirty days before the promotion ended. Did you happen to receive any correspondence from us?

Customer: I mean, I get so much mail, but... I don't remember anything specific about this. And honestly, even if I did get something, that doesn't seem right. I've been a loyal customer. You'd think you wouldn't just bump someone's bill up like that without, I don't know, giving them a heads up in the bill itself or something?

Agent: That's fair feedback, and I completely understand where you're coming from. (typing sounds) Let me see what options I have available for you. Can you hold on just one second?

Customer: Sure.

Agent: (brief hold music) (Agent returns) Okay, thanks for holding, Jennifer. So here's what I can do. I can offer you a loyalty promotion that would bring your bill down to $89.99 a month for the next twelve months. That way you'd see some savings compared to the standard rate, and you'd have time to decide if you want to continue at that rate or explore other options.

Customer: Hmm. So $89.99... that's still ten dollars more than what I was paying before.

Agent: I know it is, and I get that. The thing is, the promotional rate you had was specifically for new customers, and after that introductory period, we do transition to standard pricing. But the loyalty offer I'm providing does bring some value back. It's not quite the original rate, but it's a middle ground.

Customer: (pause) ...What if I don't want to accept that? Like, can I go back to the $79.99 somehow?

Agent: Unfortunately, that specific promotion was only valid for the first year of service, so I'm not able to reinstate that exact rate. However, the $89.99 loyalty rate is really the best option I have in my system to help offset some of this increase. It's a twelve-month commitment, and after that, we could revisit it.

Customer: Okay, but why wasn't I told about this sooner? Like, before it happened?

Agent: That's a valid question. I apologize that we didn't make that clearer to you. There should have been notification, and I'm sorry if that didn't come through clearly or if you didn't receive it. Going forward, I'm going to make a note on your account that we've discussed this, so if there's anything else coming up, we can try to reach out more directly.

Customer: (sigh) Alright... I guess I'll take the $89.99 rate. But I'm not happy about this. This feels like bait and switch, you know?

Agent: I appreciate you working with me on this, Jennifer. And I hear your frustration—I really do. The loyalty rate will start on your next billing cycle. You'll see the adjustment reflected on your bill next month. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... maybe work on your notification system, yeah?

Agent: We absolutely will take that feedback. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I'm sorry we didn't handle this as smoothly as we should have. Is there a number where we can reach you if we need to follow up on anything?

Customer: No, you've got my number on file. I'm good.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for calling Frontier, Jennifer. Have a great day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.
