Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged $89.99 this month and last month I was paying $59.99. That's a thirty dollar increase and I have no idea why.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get the phone number or account number associated with your service?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm getting into the system here. Just one moment... Alright, I see your account. You're right, I'm showing a charge of $89.99 for this billing cycle. Let me look at the previous month to compare. (pause) Okay, so I can see what happened here. It looks like your promotional rate expired.

Customer: A promotional rate? I wasn't on a promotional rate. I've had this service for... I don't know, three or four years now.

Agent: Let me check the details of your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so looking back, it appears you were enrolled in a promotional pricing plan that started back in 2021. That was a 24-month introductory offer for our Fiber 300 package at $59.99 per month. That promotional period ended last month, so your account has now moved to our standard rate of $89.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me I signed up for something four years ago that was only supposed to last two years? That doesn't make sense. Why would anyone agree to that? And more importantly, why wasn't I notified?

Agent: Those are great questions. I apologize for the confusion. You should have received notification about thirty days before the promotional period ended. Did you receive a letter or email from us around that timeframe?

Customer: (sighs) I mean... I probably got something, but who reads all that mail? The point is, I didn't know this was coming. I've been a loyal customer for years. Can't you do something about this?

Agent: I absolutely understand, and I appreciate your loyalty. Let me see what options we have available. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I can offer you a couple of things. We do have an alternative promotion right now for existing customers. I could enroll you in our Fiber 500 package, which is actually faster internet speeds, for $74.99 per month for twelve months.

Customer: So I'd be paying more than what I was paying before, just less than what you're charging me now? That doesn't seem like much of a deal.

Agent: I understand your point. Let me see what else I can do here. (pause) Another option would be to stay on your current Fiber 300 package at $89.99, but I could apply a loyalty credit of fifteen dollars per month for the next six months. That would bring your bill down to $74.99 for those six months, and then it would go back to the regular rate.

Customer: So after six months it goes back up again? Look, I'm not trying to be difficult, but this whole thing feels like bait and switch to me. You get people locked in with a good price and then jack it up. I'm honestly thinking about switching to the cable company. They've been sending me offers.

Agent: I completely hear you, and I don't want to see you go. (pause) Let me be honest with you—I want to make sure we're taking good care of you. What if I could get you into a new two-year promotional rate? It wouldn't be quite as low as your original rate, but it would be better than what we're currently offering.

Customer: How much better?

Agent: Give me one second. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at what I'm authorized to do here. I could put you on our Fiber 300 package at $64.99 per month for 24 months. After that, it would go back to the standard rate of $89.99, but at least you'd have some predictability and savings for the next two years.

Customer: (pause) ...And that's locked in? You're guaranteeing that price for two years?

Agent: Yes, I can guarantee that rate for the full 24-month period. I will add a note to your account as well, so you'll receive a notification about 30 days before the promotional period ends this time around.

Customer: Okay. Alright, yeah, I'll take that deal. But I want that note on my account. I don't want any surprises.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get that set up for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm processing the rate change to $64.99, and I'm adding a prominent note to your account about the expiration date. You should see the new rate reflected on your next billing cycle, which would be... (pause) ...September 15th. In the meantime, you'll still be charged at the current rate for the remainder of this cycle, which ends on August 15th.

Customer: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. That should do it.

Agent: Great. Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and I apologize again for the confusion with the rate change. If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
