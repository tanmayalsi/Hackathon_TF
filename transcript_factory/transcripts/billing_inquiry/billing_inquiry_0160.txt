Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge I don't recognize. Like, my bill went up like thirty dollars, and I don't know why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account, please?

Customer: It's James Martinez.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, I've got your account open here, James. I can definitely see why you'd be concerned. Let me take a look at what's changed on your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your current charges here... Can you tell me what your bill was running before?

Customer: It was like, I don't know, around ninety-five bucks a month? And now it's saying one hundred and twenty-five. That's... that's not right. I never agreed to any of that.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me see what's going on here. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that... looks like you're still on our Gigabit Fiber plan, which is excellent. But I am showing a price adjustment that took effect on your account last month.

Customer: A price adjustment? What do you mean a price adjustment? Nobody called me about that. I didn't authorize any price increase.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me explain what happened. It looks like your promotional rate expired. You were on an introductory offer for the first twelve months at eighty-nine ninety-nine, and that promotion ended, so your rate adjusted to our standard Gigabit rate, which is currently one hundred and twenty-four ninety-nine.

Customer: (frustrated) Wait, wait, wait. So you're telling me that you guys just raised my bill without letting me know? Like, that's pretty shady, man. I've been with Frontier for, I don't know, like three or four years now.

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate your loyalty. Usually, customers do receive notification about promotional expiration about thirty days before it happens. Let me check and see if there's a record of that notice being sent to you. (typing sounds) Can I ask... did you receive any notification in the mail or email about this?

Customer: I mean... I might have? I get so much mail and email, honestly. But the point is, I didn't know this was coming. Can't you just put me back on the old rate? I'm a long-time customer. That seems fair, right?

Agent: That's a fair question. And I really do want to help you out here. (pause) Let me see what options I have available. Unfortunately, that particular promotional rate is no longer available for your account type since it was a first-time customer offer. However... I do have a few things I can look into for you.

Customer: Okay, like what?

Agent: Well, first, let me see if we have any current promotions that might apply to your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that we do have a loyalty offer I can apply—it's not quite the same rate, but it would get you down to ninety-nine ninety-nine per month for the next twelve months. That's ten dollars more than your original rate, but it's about twenty-five dollars less than what you're currently being charged.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... that's better than one twenty-five, but still more than what I was paying.

Agent: Right, I understand. The thing is, this is one of the better offers I can extend to a valued customer like yourself. The standard rate going forward would be one twenty-four ninety-nine, but with this loyalty offer, you'd be at ninety-nine ninety-nine. That's actually a pretty significant savings.

Customer: (sighs) Well, I guess... I guess that's better than nothing. But I still think it's frustrating that I didn't get a heads-up about this. Like, why can't you guys just send a text or call people when their rates are about to go up?

Agent: That's actually really valuable feedback, and I genuinely understand your frustration. We do send notifications, but I recognize that not everyone sees them, and a more proactive phone call would probably help a lot of customers. I can definitely pass that along to our customer service management team. 

Customer: Yeah, please do. Because this caught me off guard.

Agent: I absolutely will. So, would you like me to go ahead and apply this loyalty offer to your account? That would bring you down to ninety-nine ninety-nine for the next year, starting with your next billing cycle.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Go ahead and do that. And it's definitely for a year, right?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, absolutely. This will be active for twelve months from today, and then we can revisit your options before that offer expires. I want to make sure you don't get surprised again. How about I make a note on your account to give you a courtesy call about thirty days before this expires? That way you'll have time to explore your options.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that would be great actually. Thank you for that.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I've applied that now. Let me just confirm everything here... Your new rate of ninety-nine ninety-nine is effective on your next billing cycle. Your account number is 503-555-0147, James Martinez, and I've added an internal note for our team to reach out to you thirty days before December 15th of next year.

Customer: Perfect. Yeah, that sounds good.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. And again, I really do apologize for the confusion on this. We appreciate your business, and thanks for being a loyal Frontier customer. You have a great day, James.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
