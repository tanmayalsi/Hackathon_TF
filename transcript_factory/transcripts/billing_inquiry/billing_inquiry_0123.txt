Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm really confused about a charge that showed up. It's like, way higher than what I've been paying.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... okay, it's 555-0847. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Let me pull that up here. (pause) Alright, I've got your account. I'm looking at Derek Hutchinson, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned you received a bill that was higher than expected. Can you tell me what amount you're seeing, and what you normally pay?

Customer: Well, normally it's like $79.99 a month for my internet plan. That's what I've been paying for... I don't know, like two years now? But this bill, the one I got yesterday, it says $119.99. That's like, forty dollars more. I don't understand why.

Agent: (typing sounds) I see. Let me take a look here at your billing history to see what's been happening with your account. (pause) Okay, so I'm pulling up your account notes now. It looks like... ah, I see what happened here. According to my system, your promotional rate expired on October 15th. You were on an introductory rate of $79.99 for the first 24 months, and that term ended.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about that. I mean, I didn't get any kind of notice or... like, why would they just change my rate without letting me know?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me see what I can find in the account. (pause) Actually, it looks like we did send a notification... (trailing off) it appears it was sent about 30 days prior to the rate change. But I understand that sometimes these things get missed.

Customer: I mean, I definitely didn't see anything. And honestly, that's a huge jump. Like, fifty percent more? That seems crazy.

Agent: I hear you. That is a significant increase. (pause) Let me see what options I have available for you here. Hold on just one moment while I check what promotions we currently have running...

Customer: Okay, sure.

Agent: (pause) (typing sounds) Alright, I'm back. So here's what I can do. I can see that you've been a great customer with us—you've had no late payments, and you've been with Frontier for over two years. I can apply a retention offer to your account. I can bring your rate down to $89.99 per month for the next 12 months.

Customer: So that's still... that's still ten dollars more than what I was paying before though. Why can't you just keep me at the original price?

Agent: I understand why you'd want that. Unfortunately, the promotional period has ended, so I'm not able to keep you at that introductory rate. However, this retention offer of $89.99 is actually about $20 below our standard rate for that plan, so it is a discount. But let me see if I can do a little better for you.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean... I guess I appreciate that you're trying, but like... can I ask a question? What if I just cancel and sign up as a new customer? Wouldn't I get the promotional rate again?

Agent: (chuckles) That's a great question, and I can see why you'd think that. Unfortunately, our system does track that, and you wouldn't qualify for a new customer promotion if you cancel and immediately re-subscribe. You'd need to be disconnected for at least 30 days, and honestly, you'd lose your service during that time, which wouldn't be ideal.

Customer: Right, right. I didn't really want to do that anyway. (pause) So what about that $89.99? For how long exactly?

Agent: That would be for 12 months from the start date. So through October of next year. After that period, it would go to our standard rate unless you call back to discuss options at that time.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) And there's nothing else you can do? Like, what if I bundle in something? Don't you guys have phone service or TV or something?

Agent: That's a good idea. We do offer phone and streaming TV services. Let me be honest with you though—if you're looking to keep costs down, adding services would increase your bill rather than decrease it. However, if you're interested in any of those services, I'd be happy to look at bundling options that might give you a better overall rate.

Customer: No, I... I don't really need that stuff. I just need the internet. (pause) Okay, you know what? I guess I can do the $89.99. But I want to make sure I understand—this is guaranteed for 12 months, right?

Agent: Exactly right. This is a 12-month promotional rate at $89.99 per month. It'll be guaranteed through October 2025. And I'll send you a confirmation email with all the details so you have it in writing.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, do that. Can you also make a note in my account or something that I need to get a reminder before this rate expires again? I don't want to get surprised by another bill increase.

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely. I'm making a note right now on your account that you requested a courtesy reminder 30 days before the rate adjustment. We don't have an automated system for that, but I've flagged it so that if you call back or if anyone reviews your account, they'll know to reach out.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. So when does this new rate go into effect?

Agent: The new rate will go into effect on your next billing cycle, which looks like it'll be November 3rd. So your November bill should reflect the $89.99 amount.

Customer: Alright. Well, I mean, thanks for at least trying to help with this. I'm still not thrilled about the increase overall, but I understand it is what it is.

Agent: I totally understand, and I really do appreciate your loyalty as a customer. If you have any other concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: Yeah, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
