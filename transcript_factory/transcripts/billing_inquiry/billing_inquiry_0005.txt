Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually, I recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it to be there.

Agent: Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into this for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, let me pull that up here... okay, I've got you. Your name is Robert Chen?

Customer: That's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And what charge are you seeing that concerns you?

Customer: So I've been with Frontier for about three years now, and my bill's always been $79.99 a month for the gigabit plan. But this month it went up to $99.99, and nobody told me about this. That's a twenty-dollar increase, Derek. That's like... that's a pretty big jump.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. Let me take a look at your account here and see what's happened. (pause, typing) Okay, so I'm seeing that you were on a promotional rate that expired. Your promotional pricing was set to end on March 15th of this year, which was about two weeks ago.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. I never signed up for a promotional rate. I've had the same plan the whole time.

Agent: I hear you. Let me just check the details here. (typing sounds) Okay, so looking back at your account notes, it looks like when you originally signed up three years ago, you were enrolled in a three-year promotional offer at $79.99 per month for our Gigabit Fiber plan. That promotion ended, and you've transitioned to our standard pricing for that plan, which is $99.99 per month.

Customer: But why didn't anybody tell me it was expiring? I mean, you guys should send a notice or something before you just... raise my bill like that.

Agent: That's a fair point, and I apologize that you weren't notified beforehand. Typically, we do send out notifications about rate changes, usually 30 days in advance. Let me check if there's a note here about whether one was sent... (pause) It looks like a notification was sent to the email address on file on February 13th.

Customer: I didn't get any email. Or I mean... maybe I got one, but it probably went to spam or something. You know how it is.

Agent: I understand. Well, the good news is that we do have some options available to you. Since you've been a loyal customer for three years, I can potentially apply a retention offer to your account. Let me see what I have available... (typing sounds)

Customer: Okay, what kind of offers?

Agent: So I'm showing that I can get you back to $84.99 per month for the next 12 months for that same Gigabit Fiber plan. That would bring your bill down from the $99.99.

Customer: So I'd still be paying five more dollars than what I was paying before?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. After the 12 months, the rate would go back to the standard $99.99 per month unless we have another promotion available at that time.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. That doesn't really feel like much of a deal, honestly. I was paying $79.99 just fine. Why should I have to pay more at all?

Agent: I hear your frustration, Mr. Chen, and I really do understand. The promotional pricing from three years ago was really a special introductory offer for new customers. The $99.99 is our standard rate for the Gigabit plan in your area. That said, let me see if there's anything else I can do here... (typing sounds) One moment, please.

Customer: (background noise of the customer shifting in their seat)

Agent: Okay, so I've looked at all the options available, and the best I can offer you is the $84.99 rate for 12 months. I could also potentially bundle this with our premium TV package, which might give you a better overall value, but I'm not sure if that interests you.

Customer: No, I don't really watch TV, and I don't need that. So my only option is to pay $84.99?

Agent: Well, there are a couple of other things to consider. You could look at one of our lower-tier plans, like the 500 Mbps plan, which would be $59.99 per month. That's a significant savings, though you would lose the gigabit speeds.

Customer: No, I use the gigabit speeds. I work from home, and I have video conferences all day. I need the bandwidth.

Agent: I completely understand. In that case, the $84.99 rate for 12 months really is the best option I can offer you at this time. I apologize that I can't bring it back to your original promotional rate.

Customer: (pause) Well, I'm not happy about this, but... I guess $84.99 is better than $99.99. Can you go ahead and put that on my account?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me apply that for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm applying the $84.99 rate for the next 12 months to your account, effective immediately. You should see that reflected on your next bill, which will be generated on the 15th of next month. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. But I just want to say, you should really make sure people get notified about these changes. It's not great to just... surprise people with a bill increase.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I appreciate that feedback. I'll make sure that's noted on your account. We do take customer satisfaction very seriously, and I'm sorry you had this experience. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, Mr. Chen. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and thanks for being a loyal customer. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
