Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. My bill went up like thirty dollars out of nowhere.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing a billing issue. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... hold on, let me grab my bill. Okay, so the account number is 4-7-2-1-9-8-5-4.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. Let me pull that up here. And what name is the account under?

Customer: It's under Michael Chen.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, Michael. I've got your account right here. I'm seeing your current bill is $89.99. Is that the amount you're seeing as well?

Customer: Yeah, that's what it says. But last month I was paying 59.99. That's a thirty dollar jump. I didn't authorize any service changes or anything. I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Michael. Let me break down what I'm seeing here. (typing sounds) So you were on our promotional pricing for your first year, and that twelve-month promotional period just ended on the 15th of this month. Your bill has been adjusted to our standard pricing for the Fiber 300 plan.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about this. I mean, I should've gotten a notification or something, right? This is the first I'm hearing about it.

Agent: You know, that's a fair point. We do send out notifications typically around 30 days before a promotional period ends, but I understand those emails can sometimes get filtered or missed. I sincerely apologize for that. The good news is that I do have some options for you. Can I tell you about those?

Customer: Yeah, please. Because I'm not just going to accept a thirty dollar price hike without knowing why.

Agent: Absolutely. So your current plan includes our Fiber 300 internet with speeds up to 300 megabits per second. At the promotional rate, it was $59.99, and now at the standard rate, it's $89.99 per month. However, I can see here that we do have some retention offers available for loyal customers like yourself. (pause) I could extend your promotional pricing for another six months at $64.99 per month. That would give you some time to evaluate your options and we'd only be increasing your bill by five dollars instead of thirty.

Customer: Hmm... (pause) So it would go to 64.99?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. $64.99 per month for the next six months, and then after that it would go to the standard rate of $89.99 unless we have other promotions available at that time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I mean, that's better than thirty dollars, but why wasn't I told about this sooner? Like, why do I have to call in to dispute it to get a better deal? That doesn't seem right.

Agent: You make a very valid point, Michael. And I really do apologize for that. You're right—we should have been more proactive in reaching out to you directly. I'm going to make a note on your account about this feedback so our retention team can see it. But the offer I'm able to give you right now is good through the end of today, so if you'd like me to apply that $64.99 rate, I can take care of that for you immediately.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Let's do that. But I want to make sure—after six months, you guys are going to notify me before anything changes again, right?

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely. I'm going to put a note right here on your account flagging this for follow-up. And we'll reach out to you at least 45 days before that promotional period ends so you'll have plenty of notice. I'm actually adding that notation right now.

Customer: Okay, good. Thank you.

Agent: (pause) All set. Your new rate of $64.99 has been applied, effective immediately. Your next bill will reflect this change. You should see it update within the next 24 hours in your online account, or you'll receive the updated bill in the mail if you're on paper billing. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... that's good. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: You're welcome, Michael. And again, I'm really sorry we didn't communicate this transition better the first time around. Is there anything else I can assist you with before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks.

Agent: Great. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
