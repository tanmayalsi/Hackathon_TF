# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my price went up? I've been a customer for like three years now and I'm not happy about this.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. And my name is Patricia Hoffman.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Patricia, I'm pulling up your account now. Let me just verify a couple details here... I've got you down at 2847 Oakmont Drive, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your recent bill here. So I can see you were on our Fiber 300 plan at $79.99 a month, and I'm showing that as of your last billing cycle on September 15th, that plan increased to $89.99. Is that the price increase you're referring to?

Customer: Yeah, that's it. That's a ten dollar increase! When did this happen? You never sent me any kind of notice about this, or... I mean, nobody called me or anything.

Agent: I understand. So we do send out notices typically about 30 days before a price adjustment takes effect. Let me check if there's any documentation on your account here. (typing sounds) It looks like we sent a bill insert notification on August 12th. Did you... did you happen to receive that, or...?

Customer: I get so many papers in my bills, Derek. I can't read everything. Why does the price have to go up? I'm paying for the same thing I was paying for before.

Agent: That's a fair question. The price adjustments we make typically reflect increases in infrastructure costs and network maintenance that help us continue to deliver the high-quality service you've been receiving. I know it's not ideal, but...

Customer: (interrupting) But that's ten dollars a month! That's $120 a year. And then there's this other charge. I see like a $15 charge for something called "equipment lease adjustment." What is that?

Agent: Let me look at that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so the equipment lease adjustment is... it looks like that's a monthly fee for your Frontier modem and router equipment that you're leasing from us. That should have been on your bill previously though. Let me check when that started appearing...

Customer: Wait, I've been paying for the modem this whole time?

Agent: (pause) It appears so, yes. Looking back at your account history, this fee has been on your bill for the last several months. It shows here at $14.99 a month. Are you saying you weren't aware of this charge?

Customer: I mean, I look at the bill but... I pay it every month. I didn't realize that was a separate thing. I thought that was just included, you know? Like part of the internet service. I have the Frontier modem and router in my house. Do I have to pay for that?

Agent: That's a good question. So you do have a couple of options. You can either continue leasing the equipment from us, or you can purchase your own compatible modem and router, which would eliminate that monthly fee. A lot of customers do that to reduce their monthly bill.

Customer: Okay, so if I buy my own, I don't have to pay that $15?

Agent: That's correct. You'd purchase your own equipment one time, and then that $14.99 monthly lease charge would be removed from your bill. It typically pays for itself in a few months depending on what equipment you choose.

Customer: Okay, well... I didn't know that was an option. That's frustrating that you don't tell people that upfront. So what about the price increase? Is there anything you can do about that?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me look at what options I have here. (pause) Unfortunately, the price increase is applied across the board to all customers on that plan. However, we do have some promotional pricing available. I can see here that I could move you to our... let me see... we have a Fiber 500 plan which is actually the same price as your previous plan was—$79.99 a month for the first year, and that would give you significantly faster speeds.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me I can get faster internet for the same price I was paying before?

Agent: Exactly, yes. It's a promotional offer we have running through the end of this quarter. Your speeds would double from 300 megabits per second to 500 megabits per second, and it would be $79.99 a month for the first 12 months. After that, it would be $99.99 a month.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's... that's actually a better deal. But I'm concerned about what happens after the first year. You're just going to raise it again?

Agent: That's a fair concern. I'll be honest with you—yes, pricing does typically increase, but at that point you'd have options. You could stay on the plan, or we could revisit other offerings at that time. And like I mentioned, if you get your own modem and router, that eliminates the $14.99 monthly charge entirely.

Customer: (pause) Alright, so if I do the Fiber 500 at $79.99, and I buy my own modem, then I'd be at the same price as before, basically?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. Your bill would be $79.99 instead of the $89.99 with the equipment lease.

Customer: Okay, I think... I think I want to do that. Can you set that up for me right now?

Agent: Absolutely. I can definitely process that for you. Let me just make a note here. (typing sounds) The Fiber 500 plan will be effective on your next billing cycle, which would be October 15th. You'll see the promotional rate of $79.99 on that bill. And then regarding the modem—do you have any questions about what equipment would be compatible with your service?

Customer: Um, not really. I'll figure that out. Can I just order it online?

Agent: You can, yes. We have a list of approved modems on our website, or you can call back and we can recommend specific models. Most people do just grab one on Amazon or from Best Buy. Just make sure whatever you get is compatible with our network. When you get the new modem set up, just let us know and we'll deactivate the lease charge immediately.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. So is there anything else I should know?

Agent: (pause) No, I think we've covered it. Your plan change is set to go into effect on October 15th. You'll get a confirmation email shortly. And Patricia, I appreciate you calling in. I know this wasn't the most pleasant interaction, but I'm glad we could work something out for you.

Customer: Yeah, I appreciate it too. I just... I wish you guys would communicate this stuff better. Like, I didn't know about the modem charge, and the price increase kind of blindsided me.

Agent: I understand, and that's feedback we value. If you'd like, I can add a note to your account for our retention team to see what additional options might be available. But I think what we've done today is a solid solution.

Customer: No, this is fine. This is good. Thank you, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we'll see you on October 15th with that plan change. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
