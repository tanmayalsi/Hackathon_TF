Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like thirty bucks from last month. I need to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having billing concerns. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So I can see your most recent bill here. You're right—your bill this month is $129.99, and last month it was $99.99. Let me take a look at what changed. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing a couple of things. First, it looks like your promotional rate expired. You were on a 12-month promotional offer for our Frontier Fiber 500 plan, and that promo ended this month, so your rate went from $79.99 to $99.99. That accounts for twenty dollars of the increase.

Customer: Wait, wait. A promotional rate? Nobody told me about that. I mean... okay, maybe they did when I signed up, but that was over a year ago. I didn't think it would just... jump up like that. That's not cool.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Robert. Unfortunately, promotional pricing does expire once the initial term ends. However, let me see what we can do here. I also notice there's an additional $30 charge this month that's labeled as a "service upgrade fee." It looks like our system shows that an equipment upgrade was processed on your account. Do you remember authorizing a modem upgrade?

Customer: An upgrade? No, I didn't authorize anything. My internet's been working fine. Why would they upgrade my equipment? I didn't ask for that.

Agent: Let me look into this a little further. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so according to the notes here, it shows that you were due for a equipment refresh as part of our standard maintenance program. The new modem is supposed to be more efficient and faster. However, I do see there's a $30 one-time installation and upgrade fee attached to that.

Customer: I didn't ask for any of this. Can you just... can you not charge me for that? That's ridiculous.

Agent: You know what, Robert? I completely understand. Let me see what I can do. (pause) Okay, so I can definitely work with you on that equipment upgrade fee. I'm going to go ahead and credit that $30 charge back to your account right now.

Customer: Really? Okay, that's... that's good. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome. However, regarding the promotional rate expiration—that $20 increase—I do want to see if we can help with that as well. Let me check what current offers we have available for you. (typing sounds, longer pause) Alright, so I'm showing that we do have a new promotional offer that I can apply to your account. It's a 12-month promotion for our Frontier Fiber 500 plan at $84.99 per month. That would actually be less than even your original promotional rate, so that would actually save you money compared to the standard price.

Customer: Okay, well that's better. How long would that be good for?

Agent: This would be a 12-month promotional period, just like your previous offer. After that, it would go back to the standard rate, which is currently $99.99. But you'd have another year at the lower rate.

Customer: So I'm going to have this problem again in a year?

Agent: That's a fair question. Honestly, yes, unless you call us back when the promotion is ending and we look into what options are available at that time. But I'd definitely recommend either setting a reminder or giving us a call a couple months before your promo ends so we can proactively look at your options and avoid any surprises on your bill.

Customer: (sigh) Okay, I guess that makes sense. Can you put this new rate on my account now?

Agent: Absolutely, I'm doing that right now. (typing sounds) Alright, so I've applied the 12-month promotional offer at $84.99 per month to your account, effective immediately. And like I said, I've also removed that $30 equipment upgrade fee. So your new bill going forward should be $84.99 instead of the $129.99 you're seeing this month.

Customer: Okay, good. What about this month's bill though? That's still going to be $129.99?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. This bill has already been finalized. However, once we process the credits I've applied, you should see an adjustment on your next billing cycle. So your next bill should reflect the promotional rate and the credit for the $30 fee.

Customer: So how much should my next bill be?

Agent: Let me calculate that for you. So your next bill will be $84.99 for the service, and then we'll have to deduct the $30 credit, so that brings you down to $54.99 for next month.

Customer: Wait, really? So I'll actually get money off next month to offset this month?

Agent: Exactly. The credit will apply to your next bill, so yes, you'll see a reduction. That should help balance things out.

Customer: Alright, well... I mean, I'm still not happy about the whole promotional rate thing and the equipment fee, but at least this helps. I appreciate that, Derek.

Agent: I really appreciate your patience, Robert. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... maybe you all could give customers a heads up before you upgrade their equipment without permission.

Agent: That's absolutely fair feedback. I'm going to make a note on your account about that. And I'll pass that along to our service team as well. We want to make sure we're communicating with our customers better. Thank you for bringing that to my attention.

Customer: Okay, thanks. I'll be watching my bill next month to make sure it looks right.

Agent: Absolutely. And hey, if you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye, Robert.
