Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Derek speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I noticed my monthly charge went up. I've been with you guys for like three years and my rate was always the same, and now suddenly it jumped like thirty dollars a month. Can you explain that to me?

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Let me just pull up your account real quick. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (pause, more typing) Okay, I've got you here... account for Michael Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm looking at your account history, and I can see that your promotional rate expired at the end of last month. You were on our introductory fiber package at $59.99 for the first twelve months, and... (pause) ...it looks like that promotion ended in November. Your rate has now adjusted to our standard pricing, which is $89.99 per month for the same service level.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. Nobody told me about this. I never signed up for any promotional rate. I just... I mean, I've been paying the same thing for three years. Why would it just automatically jump up now?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me check the notes on your account. (typing sounds) It shows here that you activated your service on November 15th of 2021, so your promotional period would have ended on November 15th of this year. And it looks like we did send out a notification about this back in October...

Customer: October? I don't remember getting anything about that. And besides, if the promo was for twelve months, shouldn't it have gone until November of 2022, not 2021? I mean, I've been paying the same price this whole time.

Agent: (pause) Let me look into this more carefully. Can you hold for just one moment while I review your account details?

Customer: Yeah, okay, I guess.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly) Thanks for holding. Okay, so I've reviewed your account, and I can see that you're right—you've been with us since 2021. However, the promotional pricing was specifically for the first year of service only. After that twelve-month period ended, your account should have been updated to the standard rate, but it appears there may have been a delay in that transition processing.

Customer: So you're saying I should have been charged the higher rate over a year ago?

Agent: Well, technically yes, based on the promotion terms. However, I completely understand why this is frustrating. The issue here is that you weren't notified properly about the rate change. Can I ask—did you receive any bills before this one that showed a different rate?

Customer: (pause) No, actually, all my bills have been the same. So I'm confused. Are you telling me I've been underbilled this whole time, or...?

Agent: No, no, I apologize for the confusion. Let me clarify. It looks like there was actually an error on our end. Your account should have transitioned to the standard rate back in November 2022, but for some reason, the system didn't process that correctly. You continued to be billed at the promotional rate through... (typing sounds) ...through October of this year. So you actually got an additional year of the promotional pricing.

Customer: (sighs) So what, you're saying I got a bonus year and now you want to make up for it?

Agent: I understand why it feels that way. Look, I want to make this right for you. Let me see what options we have. (longer pause with typing) Okay, so here's what I can do. I can credit your account for fifty percent of the difference for the months that you've been on the standard rate—that's November and December so far. And I can also... hold on. (pause) I can extend you a courtesy discount. Instead of the full $89.99 rate, I can lock you in at $79.99 for the next twelve months. How does that sound?

Customer: So I'd be paying eighty dollars instead of ninety?

Agent: Yes, exactly. And you'd get that credit applied to your account, which should show up on your next bill. Plus, this rate is locked in, so you won't see any changes for at least the next year.

Customer: (pause) I mean... that's better, I guess. But I'm still frustrated that nobody communicated this to me properly. Like, a thirty-dollar jump is a lot of money.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I'm sorry about that. The notification should have been clearer, and honestly, the whole situation could have been handled better on our end. You've been a loyal customer for three years, and you deserve better communication. This discount is my way of apologizing for that.

Customer: Okay, well... I appreciate that. So how long does this discount last again?

Agent: The discount is locked in for twelve months from today. After that, if you'd like, you can always call us back and we can discuss other options or promotions we might have available at that time.

Customer: And I'm getting that credit on my next bill?

Agent: Yes, it should appear within the next billing cycle. You'll see it itemized on your statement. (typing sounds) Okay, I've just applied that to your account now, so it should process by tomorrow.

Customer: Alright. Well, thank you for working with me on this.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier, Michael, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
