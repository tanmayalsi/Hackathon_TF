Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um... I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. My bill went up like forty dollars from last month and I want to know why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with your bill. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my cell phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And just to verify, is this for the address on Maple Street in Springfield?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. I'm looking at your account now. Okay, so I can see your bill from last month was $79.99, and this month it's showing $119.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yes! Exactly. That's... that's a huge jump. I haven't added any services or anything. What's going on?

Agent: (pause) Let me check your account history here. I see that your promotional rate expired. You were on a twelve-month promotional period for our Fiber 300 internet package, and that promo ended on the first of this month.

Customer: What? I didn't... nobody told me anything about that. When did this start? I've been with you guys for over two years.

Agent: (typing sounds) According to our records, the promotional rate was applied about a year ago when you signed up. The terms would have been outlined in the welcome materials and on your account page online, but I completely understand your frustration. It can definitely catch people off guard when the rate adjusts.

Customer: Well, I mean... I feel like I should have gotten some kind of notice or email or something. Not just a surprise forty-dollar hike on my bill.

Agent: You know what, you're absolutely right, and I apologize for that. Let me see what options I have available for you. (pause) Are you still happy with your internet service otherwise? The speed and everything?

Customer: Yeah, the internet's fine. Fast. I just... I can't justify paying that much more every month. That's almost double what I was paying before.

Agent: I understand. Well, what I can do is take a look at some alternative plans for you. We have some other packages available, and I might also be able to apply a loyalty credit or a different promotional rate to help bring that cost down. Can you hold for just one moment while I check our current promotions?

Customer: Um, sure. How long is this gonna take?

Agent: Should be just a couple minutes. Thank you for holding.

Agent: Okay, thank you for waiting. I've got some good news. I found a promotion I can apply to your account. We have a special offer right now for existing customers where I can lock you in at $89.99 per month for the next twelve months for the same Fiber 300 service you have now.

Customer: So that would be ten dollars more than my original price, but less than what I'm paying now?

Agent: Exactly. It's $89.99 instead of the $119.99 you're seeing now. So that saves you about thirty dollars a month compared to your current bill.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's... that's better. But why couldn't someone have just offered me this instead of letting my bill jump up? I mean, I almost called to cancel.

Agent: And I really do apologize for that. Ideally, we would have reached out before the rate expired. That's on us. But I'm glad I can get you taken care of today with this promotion. Does $89.99 sound good to you?

Customer: Yeah, I mean... it's not ideal, but it's better than what just happened to me. Yeah, let's do it.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm going to apply that promotion to your account now. This will start with your next billing cycle, so you should see it reflected on your next bill. And this rate is locked in for twelve months, so you won't have any surprises for at least a year.

Customer: Okay, good. And, um... will I get any kind of confirmation or something? Like an email?

Agent: Absolutely. You should receive an email confirmation within the next 24 hours with all the details of the promotion and your new rate. And if you log into your online account, you'll be able to see it updated there as well.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate that.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's everything. Thank you.

Agent: You're very welcome. Again, I really do apologize for the lack of notification on the rate change. We'll do better. You have a great day, and thank you for being a Frontier customer.

Customer: Thank you. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye!
