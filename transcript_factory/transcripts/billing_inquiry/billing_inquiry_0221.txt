Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I got my statement yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my internet bill went up again. This is ridiculous.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my home phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I get the name on the account?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: (pause, typing) Perfect, James. I'm pulling up your account now. Let me just... okay, I've got it here. I can see your most recent bill from last month. What charge are you seeing that doesn't look right?

Customer: Well, first of all, my service went from $79.99 to $89.99. When did that happen? I never got any notification about a price increase. I've been a customer for like five years.

Agent: (pause) I understand that's frustrating. Let me check the details on that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history here. It looks like we did apply a rate adjustment effective with your last billing cycle. I see that we should have sent you a notification about this... (pause) approximately 30 days before the change went into effect.

Customer: Well, I didn't get anything. Are you sure? Because my mailbox, I check it regularly. Maybe it got lost, but still—I shouldn't be charged more without actual notice.

Agent: You know what, that's a valid point. And I apologize if that notice didn't reach you properly. The price adjustment was for an upgrade to our service infrastructure in your area. We've been improving fiber availability and speeds, which does result in some changes to pricing, especially for customers in zones where we've completed upgrades.

Customer: Okay, but... (sighs) Look, I'm not trying to be difficult here, but $10 more a month adds up. That's $120 a year. And you said there's supposed to be a notification, so if I didn't get one, that's not really my problem, is it?

Agent: No, you're absolutely right. And I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Now, you mentioned there was also a charge you didn't recognize? What else is on the bill?

Customer: Yeah, there's a $15 charge for something called "equipment rental adjustment" or... I don't even know what that is. I've had the same modem for three years. Why am I being charged for that?

Agent: (typing) Let me look at that. Hmm, (pause) okay, I'm seeing that charge. It does look like there was a change made to your account. Can you tell me—are you currently using a Frontier-provided modem, or do you own your own?

Customer: It's one you guys gave me when I signed up. I'm still using the same one.

Agent: (typing) Okay, so this charge shouldn't actually be on your account. It looks like there was an error made when we processed a... (pause) actually, it appears that our system may have misapplied a line item here. This charge for an "equipment rental adjustment" shouldn't be there, especially if you're still on a standard equipment rental—that should all be included in your base service fee.

Customer: So you're saying it's a mistake?

Agent: It does appear to be a billing error, yes. I'm going to make a note here to have our billing department review this and remove that charge. That should... (typing sounds) ...that should show as a credit on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, well that's something, I guess. But what about the price increase? Can you do anything about that?

Agent: (pause) That's a tougher situation, James. The rate adjustment is part of our standard pricing structure for your service tier and location. However, I want to make sure we're not charging you more than you should be. Are you currently on our standard fiber plan, or do you have any promotional rate applied?

Customer: I think it's just the regular plan. I have the 300 megabit speed tier.

Agent: (typing) Okay, let me just... (pause) ...yes, I'm seeing that. So you're on our Fiber 300 plan. The new rate of $89.99 is actually our standard rate for that tier in your area post-infrastructure upgrade. However, what I can do is look at whether we have any promotional options available for you right now.

Customer: What kind of options?

Agent: Well, we do have some promotional packages available for existing customers. Let me see what I can find here... (typing sounds) Okay, so one thing I can offer you is a rate lock promotion. If you extend your service agreement by one year—just to lock in your commitment—I can bring your rate down to $84.99 for the next 12 months. After that, it would go back to the standard rate.

Customer: Wait, so I'd have to sign a contract for that? I don't really want to do that.

Agent: I understand that hesitation. The alternative is, I could offer you a one-time courtesy credit of $20 applied to your account to help offset the rate increase. That wouldn't require any contract extension.

Customer: (pause) How long would that credit be for? Is it just one month?

Agent: That would be a one-time credit, so it would appear on your next bill. But combined with the removal of that equipment charge—which should also be credited—you'd be looking at about $35 in credits on your next statement.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, well... I guess that's better than nothing. But I'm still not happy about the price increase going forward. This is the second increase I've had in two years.

Agent: I hear you, and I do want to be transparent about this—these adjustments are part of how we maintain our network and provide the upgraded speeds and reliability that come with the fiber infrastructure investment. However, I've made a note on your account regarding this price increase. If you do decide you'd like to explore that promotional rate lock, or if you'd like to discuss any other options—maybe a different service tier—please don't hesitate to call back. We value your five years as a customer.

Customer: Alright. So to be clear, what are you doing for me here?

Agent: (typing) Okay, so here's what I've documented: First, I'm removing that $15 equipment rental adjustment charge—that was a billing error. Second, I'm issuing a one-time courtesy credit of $20 to your account. Both of those should appear as credits on your next bill. And third, I'm flagging your account to our billing supervisor just to make sure the rate increase was applied correctly and that your notification should have been received.

Customer: Okay. And that'll all show up next month?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. Your next statement should reflect those adjustments. And James, I do want to apologize again that you didn't receive the notification about the rate change. That's something we should have communicated better.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate that. So is there anything else I need to do?

Agent: No, you're all set on your end. I have your information documented, and those credits and adjustments will be processed. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your time, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business. You have a great day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
