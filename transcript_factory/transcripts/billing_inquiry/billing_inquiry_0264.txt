Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, I'm also seeing that my internet bill went up like thirty dollars? I've been a customer for... I don't know, five or six years now, and this is ridiculous.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'm sorry you're experiencing that. Let me pull up your account and take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's... (pause) ...it's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for service at 2847 Maple Street in Bozeman?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great. Okay, I'm looking at your account now. So I do see that there was a rate adjustment that went into effect with your last billing cycle. Can you tell me which charge you're questioning specifically? Is it one of the line items on your bill?

Customer: Um, yeah, there's this thing that says "Equipment Upgrade Fee" for like forty-five dollars. I didn't ask for any upgrade. I didn't agree to this. And then my base internet service went from... I had it written down here somewhere... it was seventy-nine ninety-nine, and now it's one-oh-nine and ninety-nine. That's thirty bucks!

Agent: (pause) Okay, I see both of those items. Let me explain what happened here. The equipment upgrade fee—do you recall receiving a modem or router recently? Or any equipment at your address in the last month or so?

Customer: Well, yeah, I mean, something showed up at my door like three weeks ago. I just assumed it was something I ordered and forgot about. I didn't open it right away. But I didn't request that.

Agent: I understand. So what likely happened is that you were scheduled for a modem upgrade. This is something that we do proactively to improve customer experience and network performance. The notification would have been sent via email or mail about ten days before the equipment arrived.

Customer: I... I don't remember getting any notification. And even if I did, it's my modem. Why do I have to pay forty-five dollars to upgrade my own equipment?

Agent: That's a fair question. The upgrade fee covers the installation, activation, and technical support for the new equipment. However, I want to make sure—did you actually need to install this modem, or did we do that remotely?

Customer: I mean, I plugged it in myself. That's it. I didn't call anyone. I don't know, it just... it seems like you're charging me for something I didn't ask for.

Agent: (typing sounds) Right. And I appreciate that feedback. Let me look into this a little further. As for the price increase on your internet service—that rate adjustment is part of our standard annual review. We haven't raised rates in your area for about two years, so this is the first adjustment since you've been with us.

Customer: That doesn't really make me feel better, to be honest. Two years or not, my bill just went up significantly. And I'm seeing all these other companies doing promotional rates. I was actually looking at some alternatives before I called you.

Agent: I hear you. Competition is definitely out there. (pause) So, what I can do for you today is a couple of things. First, I can look into potentially waiving that equipment upgrade fee as a courtesy, especially since you weren't expecting it. That would get you that forty-five dollars credited back. As for the rate increase—that's set across our service area, so I can't reverse that, but what I can do is see if there are any current promotions or packages we can move you to that might help offset some of that increase.

Customer: (pause) Okay... waiving the fee would be something, I guess. But I'd really like to know why I'm just being charged for this stuff without... like, without actually choosing it.

Agent: That's totally valid. I'll be making a note on your account about this. We do send notifications, but I understand that sometimes they can be missed, and I think this is a reasonable concern. Let me go ahead and process that credit for the forty-five dollars right now.

Customer: (pause) Okay.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I've initiated that credit. You should see it reflected on your next bill. Now, regarding the promotional offers—let me see what we have available in your area. (brief hold music plays) Thank you for your patience. Okay, so I'm looking at our current offers, and we actually have a promotion that could help. We can lock in a discounted rate of eighty-nine ninety-nine for your first year on our Gigabit service level, which is actually a speed upgrade from what you're currently on. That would be less than what you're paying now.

Customer: Wait, so you're saying I'd get faster internet and pay less than the one-oh-nine ninety-nine?

Agent: Exactly. That's the promotional pricing—eighty-nine ninety-nine for the first twelve months. After that, it would go to the standard rate, which would be more than the promotion, but we can discuss that when it's closer to renewal.

Customer: Huh. Well, that's... that's actually better. But I'm still irritated about the equipment thing.

Agent: I completely understand, and I appreciate your patience while we worked through this. Is there anything else I can help clarify about the promotion or your account?

Customer: No, I think... I mean, if you're crediting the fee and lowering my rate, I guess we're good for now. But just so you know, this whole process—I shouldn't have had to call in to figure this out. You guys should be more transparent about these charges.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I'm going to include that feedback with the note I'm making on your account. We do appreciate you bringing this to our attention. I'll go ahead and process the service upgrade for you right now, and you should see everything reflected on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Alright.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Wonderful. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I'm sorry we didn't get this right the first time. If you have any issues with the new modem or the upgraded service, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day.

Customer: Yeah, thanks. You too.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Goodbye.

Customer: Bye.
