# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. May I have your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, it's 555-0147. My name is David Chen.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, David. I've got your account pulled up here. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, so I got my bill yesterday and... I don't know, something seems really off. My bill jumped up like thirty dollars since last month. I've been a customer for almost three years now and I've never seen an increase like that. I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I completely understand your concern, David. Let me take a look at your billing here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing your current bill is $109.99. Can you tell me what you were paying previously?

Customer: It was $79.99. I know that for sure because I actually check my statements. So like, I'm getting charged an extra thirty bucks and I have no idea why. Did you guys raise your rates or something?

Agent: Let me investigate that for you. (typing sounds) So looking at your account, I see you're currently on our Fiber 200 plan with equipment rental. Let me check what happened in the last billing cycle... (pause) Ah, okay, I found something here. It looks like you had a promotional rate that was set to expire at the end of last month. That promotion gave you twelve months at $79.99, and that period has just concluded.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. So you're telling me that you guys intentionally charged me less for a year and then just... jacked up the price without telling me? I never agreed to some surprise rate hike.

Agent: I understand this is frustrating, David. Let me explain how that works. When you signed up for service, that promotional rate was clearly outlined in your service agreement for a twelve-month period. After the promotional period ends, your rate does return to our standard pricing. However, I do see that you should have received a notification about this.

Customer: I mean, I don't remember getting anything about this. Did you guys actually send something?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check the notes here... It looks like we sent you a notification via email approximately thirty days before your promotional period ended. That would have been around... mid-November. Did you happen to receive any emails from Frontier around that time?

Customer: (pause) Okay, maybe I got an email. Honestly, I probably didn't read it because I get like a hundred emails a day. But still, you can't just raise someone's bill by nearly forty percent without making sure they see it. That's... that's not right.

Agent: I hear you, David, and I appreciate your feedback. The promotion was always temporary, but I do want to help make this right. Let me see what options I have available for you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I can offer you a couple of things. First, I can apply a one-time account credit of $30 to offset this month's increase. Additionally, I can enroll you in a new promotional offer where I can lock in your rate at $89.99 for the next twelve months.

Customer: So instead of $79.99, I'm paying $89.99? That's still ten dollars more than what I was paying.

Agent: Yes, that's correct. That's our standard introductory rate right now. However, that's ten dollars instead of the thirty dollar jump, and you'd be locked in at that rate for a full year. We could revisit options at the end of that period.

Customer: (sighs) What if I cancel? What are you gonna do then?

Agent: Well, I don't want to see you go, David. You've been a valued customer for three years. But if you were to cancel service, there would be no early termination fees on your account since your contract period has ended. However, I would really recommend trying the new promotional rate. We've got great service in your area and...

Customer: Let me ask you this—is this the best you can do? Like, is there any way to get me back to $79.99?

Agent: (pause) That particular promotion is no longer available for existing customers. What I can do is apply that $30 credit immediately, and then offer you the $89.99 rate for twelve months. That would bring your first month down to $59.99, and then $89.99 after that. I apologize, but that's the best offer I can provide at this time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, fine. Yeah, go ahead and do that. But I'm telling you, I'm not happy about this. Your company really needs to make these transitions clearer because... I mean, I almost called to cancel today.

Agent: I really appreciate you giving us another chance, David. I'm going to process that $30 credit and enroll you in the new promotional rate right now. (typing sounds) And listen, your feedback is valuable. We do want to improve our communications about rate changes, and I'm going to add a note to your account about this experience.

Customer: Okay, thank you. So just to confirm, my next bill should be $59.99, and then it'll be $89.99 after that?

Agent: That's exactly right. The $30 credit will appear on your next billing statement, and then starting the month after that, you'll see the $89.99 rate for the next twelve months. You'll receive email notifications next time a promotional period is coming to an end as well. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, David. I really appreciate your business, and thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer. If you have any issues with your service in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
