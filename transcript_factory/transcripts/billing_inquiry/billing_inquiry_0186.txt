Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Actually, no—I recognize it, but I shouldn't be paying it.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my service number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I'm pulling that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Kowalski. K-O-W-A-L-S-K-I.

Agent: (pause) Got it, James. I'm looking at your account here. I see your most recent bill from last month. Can you tell me which charge is concerning you?

Customer: Yeah, so I'm looking at my statement right now. There's a $19.99 charge for something called "Premium Network Security Plus." I never signed up for that. I didn't authorize that.

Agent: Okay, I understand your concern. Let me look into that for you. (typing sounds) I'm seeing that charge here on your account as well. It shows it was added to your service about six weeks ago. Do you remember receiving any communication about that?

Customer: No, nothing. I mean, I would've remembered because I would've called right away. I already have antivirus software on my computer. I don't need some... what did you call it... Premium Network Security?

Agent: Premium Network Security Plus. I completely understand. It's a service that protects your connected devices and network. But if you didn't authorize it and don't want it, we can absolutely remove that for you.

Customer: Yes, please remove it. And I want to be refunded for the charges. How many months have I been paying for this thing?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Looking at your account history, it appears this service was added six weeks ago, so that would be... one complete billing cycle. You'd be looking at one charge of $19.99 that we can review for a refund.

Customer: One? Okay, that's not as bad as I thought. But still, I shouldn't have been charged in the first place.

Agent: You're absolutely right. I apologize for that. Let me just ask—did you possibly chat with one of our representatives or visit our website around that time? Sometimes these services get added during an interaction, and there should have been a confirmation, but I know these things can slip through the cracks.

Customer: (pause) Well, I mean, I might have chatted with someone about... I think I was having an issue with my connection dropping? But I definitely didn't ask for any security service.

Agent: That makes sense. Sometimes during troubleshooting, we do mention available services, but you're right—it should never be added without explicit consent. I'm going to go ahead and remove this service from your account effective immediately, and I'm also going to issue a credit for that $19.99 charge. That should appear on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, good. How long will that take?

Agent: The service will be removed right away—it should stop appearing on your bill starting next month. The credit will show up on your statement within the next billing cycle, so you should see it within the next week or two.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. But I gotta ask—is there anything else on my bill that I should know about? Any other charges I didn't authorize?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Let me take a look at your current services. You have our Fiber 500 Internet plan at $79.99 per month, standard equipment rental at $14.99, and then there was the Network Security Plus we just discussed. Those are the charges on your account. The internet plan—has that rate been consistent for you?

Customer: Well, actually, now that you mention it... I feel like that price went up at some point? I thought I was paying like $69.99 before.

Agent: (pause) Let me check your billing history. (typing sounds) I'm seeing that you were on a promotional rate of $69.99 for your first year of service. That promotion ended about four months ago, and your rate adjusted to the standard rate of $79.99. There should have been a notice sent to you about that rate change prior to the adjustment.

Customer: (sighs) A notice? I don't remember getting any notice. When did you send that?

Agent: According to our system, it was sent about five weeks before the rate change took effect. It would have been included in your billing statement and also sent to the email address on file. Did you check your email, or...?

Customer: I mean, I probably missed it. I get a lot of emails. But this is still frustrating, Derek. I feel like my bill just keeps going up.

Agent: I hear you, James. I understand that's frustrating. The rate increase is part of our standard pricing structure once promotional periods end—that's something that's disclosed when you sign up. However, I want to make sure you're aware that you do have options. If you'd like, I can review other plans we have available, or I could connect you with our retention team who might be able to offer you an alternative promotion.

Customer: (pause) What kind of promotion are we talking about?

Agent: Well, I don't have access to those specific offers from here, but the retention team would be able to see what we can do for you. They typically have access to special offers for customers looking to stay with us. No promises, but it's worth a conversation.

Customer: (hesitates) I mean... I'm not really looking to switch providers or anything. I've had you guys for, what, almost two years now?

Agent: (pause) According to your account, you've been with us for twenty months. So you're right—almost two years.

Customer: Yeah, the service has been solid. I just... I don't like being surprised by charges, you know?

Agent: That's fair. I totally understand. So what I can do for you is make a note on your account about this, and I'll remove that security service and process that credit. Then, if you'd like, I can transfer you to our retention team and they can look at what options might be available for you pricing-wise. How does that sound?

Customer: Okay, sure. Yeah, let's do that. But I want to make sure I actually get that credit. What's your name again?

Agent: It's Derek. And I want to assure you that the credit is going through right now. You should see it on your next statement. I'm making a note here that we're issuing a credit for the unauthorized service charge, and I'm putting your account number and my employee ID in there so it's documented.

Customer: Okay, good. And I'll be able to see that on my next bill?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. It should appear as a credit on your next bill. Give it a couple of weeks if there's any delay, but it shouldn't take longer than that.

Customer: Alright. Go ahead and transfer me to that retention team then.

Agent: Perfect. Let me put you through to them. Just give me one quick second. (pause, hold music plays) Thanks for your patience, James. I'm connecting you now.

Customer: (pause) Alright.

Agent: Thanks for calling Frontier. You should be through momentarily.
