Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my internet price went up like thirty bucks. What's going on?

Agent: I'm sorry you're experiencing that. I'd be happy to help clarify those charges for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. One moment please... Alright, I've got your account here. The name on the account is... Michael Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned you have two concerns—a price increase and an unrecognized charge. Let me start by looking at your most recent bill here. (pause) I can see that your service plan was adjusted. Can you tell me which charge seemed unfamiliar to you?

Customer: Well, there's like a $29.99 charge that just says "premium router rental." I've never seen that before. I've had the same router for like... I don't know, three years? And they never charged me for it.

Agent: Okay, I understand your frustration. Let me explain what happened here. It looks like you were previously on our standard router included in your service plan, but about two billing cycles ago, your account was updated to include our premium WiFi 6 router. This newer router offers significantly faster speeds and better coverage, especially if you have multiple devices connected.

Customer: But I didn't ask for that. I didn't call and request that or anything. How did that even happen?

Agent: That's a great question. Looking at the notes here... (pause) it appears this may have been added during a promotional period we were running. However, I do see that you should have received a notification about this change. Did you happen to see any of our communications about this upgrade?

Customer: No, I didn't get anything. Or maybe it was in one of those emails I didn't read, I'm not sure. But the point is, I didn't authorize this. Can you take it off?

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what I can do for you. The good news is that I can absolutely remove that premium router charge. We can either revert you back to the standard router, or if you'd like to keep the premium router, I can see if we can work out a credit or discount on that fee.

Customer: I mean... do I even need the premium router? What's the difference really?

Agent: Good question. The WiFi 6 technology is really beneficial if you're doing things like streaming 4K video on multiple devices, working from home with video conferencing, or if you have a lot of smart home devices. But if your connection has been working fine for you, the standard router would serve you just as well.

Customer: Yeah, honestly, my internet has been fine. Like, the speed is good. I'm not doing anything fancy. I just want my bill to go back to what it was.

Agent: That makes total sense. Okay, so I'm going to remove the premium router charge and switch you back to the standard router. You should see a credit on your next bill. Now, regarding the price increase you mentioned—can you tell me what your service plan costs used to be?

Customer: It was like... I think $79.99 a month? And now it's saying $109.99.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me look into that. (pause) Hmm, I'm seeing that you have our Fiber 500 plan, and it looks like there was a rate adjustment in your area about four weeks ago. Did you receive a notification about a rate change?

Customer: I mean, probably? I don't really pay attention to those things until I see it on the bill. Why did the rate go up that much?

Agent: I hear you. So we do periodically adjust rates based on network improvements, maintenance, and operational costs in your area. The Fiber 500 plan in your region did see a $25 increase. I apologize that it's a significant jump.

Customer: That's pretty frustrating. I've been with you guys for how long... (pause) I've been a customer for like seven years now. You'd think loyalty would count for something.

Agent: You know what, you make a really good point, and I appreciate your loyalty. Let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) Okay, so I can offer you a couple of options. I can credit back the thirty dollars for this month, which will help offset some of that increase. And since you've been such a long-time customer, let me see if I can get you into a promotional rate for the next six months.

Customer: Really? That would help.

Agent: Absolutely. (pause) Okay, I'm not quite seeing the promo options I need right now, but what I can do is get a supervisor to review your account, and they should be able to apply a longer-term rate reduction for you. But I can definitely get that thirty-dollar credit applied today, and I'm removing the premium router fee starting with your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay, that's better. So when would I see the credit?

Agent: The credit should appear on your next bill, which would be... (typing sounds) in about nine days. And then I'm going to transfer you over to my supervisor, Marcus, who will take a look at getting you locked into a better rate. Is that okay?

Customer: Yeah, sure. Will I have to explain everything again?

Agent: No, not at all. I'm putting a note on your account right now with all the details—the router removal, the credits, everything. Marcus will have full context. You shouldn't have to repeat yourself.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that.

Agent: Great. Just give me one moment while I transfer you. And Michael, thanks again for being a Frontier customer for all these years. We really do value your business.

Customer: Thanks, I appreciate it.

Agent: (brief hold music) Connecting you now.
