Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm pretty upset about it. My internet bill went up like... I think it's almost thirty dollars more than last month, and nobody told me about this.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And just to verify, what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's under Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account here. I see you're on our Gig Fiber 500 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've had it for like... over a year now, I think. And it's been the same price the whole time until this month.

Agent: Got it. Well, let me explain what I'm seeing here. (typing sounds) So, it looks like you had a promotional rate that was ending. You were on an introductory offer for $79.99 per month for the first twelve months. That promotion expired at the end of last month, so your rate has adjusted to our standard rate of $109.95.

Customer: What? I didn't... I mean, I don't remember anyone telling me about that. Shouldn't you guys have to notify me before you just raise my bill like that?

Agent: That's a great question, and I completely understand your frustration. We do send out notifications about rate changes, usually about 30 days before they take effect. It would have been included in your bill or potentially sent as a separate notice. Sometimes those can get overlooked or end up in spam, unfortunately.

Customer: Well, I definitely didn't see anything. And that's a huge increase. That's like... almost forty percent more. Is there anything you can do about this?

Agent: I hear you. Let me see what options I have available. (pause) (typing sounds) So, since your promotional period has ended, you're not eligible for that introductory rate again. However, I do have some current promotions running that might help. We have a retention offer I could apply to your account.

Customer: What kind of offer?

Agent: I can put you on our current promotion, which would bring your rate down to $89.99 per month for the next twelve months. So you'd see an increase, but it wouldn't be as dramatic as the standard rate jump.

Customer: So it's still ten dollars more than what I was paying, but at least it's not thirty dollars more. How long does that last?

Agent: Twelve months. And after that year, the rate would adjust again, but I would recommend calling back in about eleven months, and we can discuss options at that time. Many customers are able to get renewal offers when they reach out proactively.

Customer: (sighs) I mean, that's better than nothing, but it just feels like you're nickel-and-diming me, you know? And how am I supposed to know when to call back? Why can't you just lock in a rate?

Agent: I understand your concern, and that's actually a really valid point. Unfortunately, the way our pricing structure works, promotional rates do have expiration dates. But here's what I can do—I can make a note on your account to reach out to you about 30 days before your promotion ends in a year. That way, you won't have to remember to call back.

Customer: Really? You can do that?

Agent: Absolutely. I can add that to your account notes right now. (typing sounds) Done. So, you should expect a call or email from us around next October.

Customer: Okay, that's... that actually helps. So if I agree to this, what's my bill going to be?

Agent: Your bill will be $89.99 per month starting with your next billing cycle. Since your promotion just ended, I can actually backdate this credit to cover the difference from this month. So you should see an adjustment credit applied within the next few days.

Customer: Wait, really? So you'll credit me back the difference?

Agent: Yes. Your bill this month was $109.95, correct?

Customer: I don't... I mean, I got the bill yesterday, so I'm not sure exactly what it said, but that sounds right.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to apply the promotional rate retroactively, which means you'll get a credit for the difference between the $109.95 and the $89.99. That's $19.96 that should show up on your account within a few business days.

Customer: Oh, wow, okay. That actually does make it better. I appreciate that.

Agent: Of course. It's the least I can do. So, to recap, I've applied the promotion to your account. Your new rate is $89.99 per month for twelve months, you're getting a credit of $19.96 for this month, and I've added a note to reach out to you in about a year to discuss renewal options. Does that all sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks for doing that. I'm sorry for being kind of snippy at the beginning.

Agent: Please, don't apologize. You had every right to be frustrated. I would be too. And hey, is there anything else I can help you with today? How's your service been otherwise?

Customer: No, the internet's actually great. I've been really happy with Frontier. It's just... you know, the surprise bill thing.

Agent: That makes sense. Well, I'm glad the service has been good for you. I really do apologize for that confusion with the promotion ending. I'll make sure those account notes are clear so you hear from us next time around.

Customer: Great. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're welcome. Thanks so much for calling Frontier Communications, and have a great day, Michael.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
