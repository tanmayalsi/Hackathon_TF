Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and... I mean, I've been a customer for like three years now, and my internet bill just jumped up by thirty dollars. Thirty dollars! And I have no idea why.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account real quick here. (typing sounds) Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. Let me just... (pause) ...take a look at what's going on. So you're saying your bill increased this month?

Customer: Yeah, this is the first time it happened. Last month I paid $79.99, and this month it's $109.99. That's... that's a huge difference. I don't remember getting any notice about a rate increase or anything.

Agent: Okay, so let me explain what I'm seeing here. It looks like... (pause) ...your promotional rate expired. You were on a promotional pricing plan for 24 months, and that period ended this month. So you're transitioning to our standard rate for that service tier.

Customer: Wait, hold on. Nobody told me about this. I never agreed to anything being temporary. You're just charging me more now?

Agent: I understand why that's frustrating. Let me be clear about what happened—when you signed up three years ago, you enrolled in a promotional offer that was guaranteed at that lower price for the first two years. After that period ends, the rate adjusts to our standard pricing.

Customer: That doesn't make sense. I mean, I've been paying on time every month. I've been a good customer. Why would you just—

Agent: No, you're right, and I appreciate your loyalty. (pause) Let me see what I can do for you here. (typing) Just one moment while I look at what options we might have available.

Customer: (sighs) I just... I'm on a fixed income, Derek. An extra thirty bucks a month is a lot for me.

Agent: I hear you. I really do. I'm gonna check what promotional options I can offer you as a long-standing customer. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at a couple of things. We do have a current promotion that could bring your bill back down. It's a new 12-month promotional rate that I can apply to your account. That would bring it to $84.99 per month.

Customer: Okay, so instead of $109.99, it would be $84.99?

Agent: That's correct. And that rate is locked in for the next 12 months. After that period, it would revert to standard pricing again, which would be $109.99. But at least you'd have some breathing room.

Customer: (pause) ...So I'm going to have the same problem a year from now?

Agent: That's a fair question. Honestly, yes—you would likely see another rate adjustment after the promotional period ends. However, promotions come available periodically, so we could discuss options at that time as well. What I can do is make a note on your account that you're on a fixed income, and when that promotion ends, we can have you call back in and we can see what we might be able to work out.

Customer: Hmm. I mean, that's... I guess that's better than nothing. But this feels really bait-and-switch to me. Like, you offer me a low price to get me as a customer, and then you just raise it without warning.

Agent: And I understand why it feels that way. The promotional pricing is definitely in the terms and conditions when you sign up, but I will admit that not everyone reads through all of that. I'm sorry you're frustrated. But what I can tell you is that by applying this 12-month promotion, you're only paying about five dollars more than you were originally, so it's a much better situation than jumping straight to the standard rate.

Customer: Yeah, I guess. (pause) Can you just... can you verify that this promotion won't—like, there won't be any other hidden charges or anything, right?

Agent: No hidden charges. This is just for your internet service. The $84.99 is your all-in rate for the next 12 months. No surprises.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, alright. Let's do it.

Agent: Perfect. I'm applying that right now. (typing sounds) There we go. So your new rate of $84.99 will be reflected on your next billing cycle. You'll see it on your statement next month.

Customer: How long does that take to show up?

Agent: Your bill cycles on the 15th of the month, so you should see it reflected on your very next bill. I'm also sending you an email confirmation of this change, so you'll have that for your records as well.

Customer: Okay, good. I appreciate that.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. I'm not thrilled about the situation, but I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: I'm glad I could help. And just to reiterate, give us a call back about a month before that 12 months is up, and we can explore what options might be available to you at that time.

Customer: I will. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
