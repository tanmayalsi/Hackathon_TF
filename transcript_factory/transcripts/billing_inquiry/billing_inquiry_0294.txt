# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I noticed my internet bill went up. Like, significantly. I've been a customer for almost three years and my rate was always the same, and now suddenly it jumped like thirty dollars a month. I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account here and take a look at what's happening. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. Let me just... (pause) ...and there we go. I see your account here. You're right, I'm looking at the billing history and I can see the increase. So what I'm seeing is that you were on our promotional rate of $59.99 a month, and that promotional period expired last month.

Customer: Okay, but nobody told me about that. Like, I don't remember signing up for some promotional thing. I just... I've been paying the same amount for years.

Agent: I hear you. Let me look at when that promotion started. (typing sounds) So according to our records, the promotional pricing was set to expire after 24 months. You enrolled on March 15th, 2021, so the promotion ended on March 15th, 2024. But I do see that we should have sent you a notification about this.

Customer: Well, I didn't get one. Or if I did, it definitely wasn't clear. And what am I paying now? Because the bill says $89.99. That's not a small difference.

Agent: Right, so after the promotional period, you're on our standard Gig Fiber plan, which is currently $89.99 per month. I do see that we had sent out a notification via email about... (pause) ...it looks like it was sent about 60 days before your rate change. Did you receive any emails from us around mid-January?

Customer: (sighs) I mean, I get a lot of emails. I probably didn't read it carefully. But that's thirty dollars more. I didn't agree to that. What are my options here?

Agent: Well, I appreciate your patience with this. So here's what I can do for you. Since you've been a loyal customer for three years with us, and to acknowledge that the notification could have been clearer, I can offer you a retention promotion. I can put you back on a discounted rate of $69.99 per month for the next 12 months. That would give you some time to decide if you want to continue at the regular rate after that, and you'd have proper notice this time.

Customer: Okay, $69.99... so that's still ten dollars more than I was paying before.

Agent: That's correct. So the original promotional rate was $59.99, and this new rate would be $69.99. I understand that's still an increase, but it's significantly less than the $89.99 standard rate. And I want to be transparent with you—the reason these rates do increase is that your first year or two with us typically includes some promotional pricing as part of our acquisition offer.

Customer: (pause) So you're saying this is just what happens. Everyone gets the deal for a couple years and then the price goes up.

Agent: I understand it can feel that way, and I don't want to mislead you. The thing is, what we try to do is work with our customers. If you call us, there's often something we can do. And actually, I have another option if you'd like. We're currently running a new promotion on our Gig Fiber plan. If you're interested, I could sign you up for a new 24-month promotional agreement at $64.99 per month. But that would be a new two-year commitment on your part.

Customer: Hmm. What if I just... what if I want to shop around? What's the penalty for canceling?

Agent: That's a good question. Let me check your account terms here. (typing sounds) So since your promotional rate has already expired, you're month-to-month right now. There's no early termination fee. You're free to cancel anytime.

Customer: Okay. And you're saying if I stay with you, I can either do $69.99 for 12 months, or the $64.99 for 24 months?

Agent: Exactly right. The $64.99 option would save you a bit more per month, but it does lock you in for two years. The $69.99 option gives you more flexibility. Both would be substantial savings compared to the $89.99 standard rate.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean... I like my service with Frontier. The speeds are good and I haven't had any issues. I don't really want to switch. Can I think about it? Or... actually, can you do the $64.99 for 12 months instead of 24? That seems like a fair middle ground.

Agent: That's actually a really reasonable request. Let me see what I can do here. (pause, typing sounds) You know what, I'm going to make an exception here. I can set you up with the $64.99 rate for 12 months with no additional commitment beyond that. I think that's fair given your loyalty and how long you've been with us.

Customer: Really? Okay, that works for me. That's... that's much better than thirty dollars more, so I appreciate that.

Agent: Great. I'm really glad we could work this out. So to confirm, I'm going to change your rate effective with your next billing cycle to $64.99 per month for the next 12 months. And the good news is, I'm sending you an email right now with all the details of this new agreement, so you'll have it in writing. And I'm also going to make a note on your account about the notification issue, so we can make sure you get a clear heads-up before this rate expires in 12 months.

Customer: Perfect. Thank you, I appreciate that. And just to be clear, my internet speed and everything stays the same, right? This is just the price?

Agent: That's exactly right. Your service doesn't change at all. You're still on our Gig Fiber plan with the same speeds. This is just a pricing adjustment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: Of course, and thank you for being a Frontier customer. Is the email address we have on file still the best way to reach you?

Customer: Yeah, that should be fine.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thanks for calling in today, and we really appreciate your business. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
