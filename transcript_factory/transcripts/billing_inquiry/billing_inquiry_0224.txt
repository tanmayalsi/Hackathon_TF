Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I've been a customer for like, three years now, and I've never seen this before.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Can you verify the last four digits of the phone number on the account for me?

Customer: It's 8823.

Agent: Perfect. Alright, I've got your account here. I'm seeing your account is in the name of David Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize. Can you tell me which charge you're referring to?

Customer: Yeah, so on this month's bill, there's like a $25 charge that says "Equipment Upgrade Fee." I don't know what that is. I didn't ask for any equipment upgrade, and I don't remember authorizing anything like that.

Agent: Okay, I understand your concern. Let me look into that for you. (pause, typing sounds) So I'm looking at your account history here... It looks like we did have a service visit scheduled for your address about two weeks ago. Were you home for that?

Customer: Yeah, I mean, somebody came by, but they just... I don't know, I think they just checked on the router or something. They didn't ask me about any upgrade. Why would they charge me for that?

Agent: That's a fair question. So it looks like the technician did perform a modem upgrade during that visit. Sometimes we do complimentary upgrades to newer equipment to improve customer service, but I'm seeing here that this particular modem was listed as a billable upgrade on your account.

Customer: But I didn't ask for it! (slightly frustrated) I mean, if it was complimentary, why am I being charged?

Agent: I hear you, and I apologize for the confusion. Let me look a little deeper here. (typing sounds) Hmm, I'm not actually seeing any documentation that the customer explicitly requested this upgrade. Can you hold for just one moment while I check with my supervisor on this?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (brief hold music, about 30 seconds)

Agent: Thank you for holding. So I spoke with my supervisor, and based on what I'm seeing in the notes, it does appear this may have been marked as a billable upgrade in error. Our standard practice is that equipment upgrades are complimentary to our customers. So I'd like to remove that $25 charge from your account right now.

Customer: Oh, okay. (relieved) Really? Just like that?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I'm going to go ahead and process a credit to your account for $25. You should see that reflected on your next bill, which would be... (typing sounds) ...in about a week and a half. You'll also receive a confirmation email within the next 24 hours.

Customer: Okay, great. I appreciate that. Um, but actually, now that I have you on the phone, I was going to call back anyway because I noticed my bill went up. Like, my regular service charge was $79.99 last month, and this month it's $89.99. Did I sign up for something extra or...?

Agent: Let me take a look at that for you. (pause, typing) Okay, so I'm reviewing your account... Ah, yes, I see the increase. So that price adjustment is actually due to a service plan change that went into effect in your area. We have promoted our internet speeds in your region from 500 megabits per second to gigabit speeds, and the price reflects that upgrade.

Customer: Wait, so I'm getting faster internet automatically? I wasn't notified about this.

Agent: You should have received a notification in the mail about 30 days ago, but I understand that sometimes those can get lost or overlooked. The good news is you're now receiving significantly faster internet speeds at that price point. However, if you'd prefer to maintain your previous speed tier and pricing, I can absolutely downgrade your service back to the previous plan.

Customer: No, no, faster internet sounds good. I guess it's just... you know, ten dollars more a month, that's a hundred and twenty dollars a year. (pause) Is there anything you can do about that? Like a discount or something?

Agent: That's understandable. Let me see what I can find for you. (longer pause, typing sounds) Okay, so typically we do have promotional pricing available for existing customers. What I can do is apply a $10 monthly credit for the first three months as a service retention offer. That would bring your bill back to $79.99 for those three months, and then after that it would return to the new rate of $89.99.

Customer: Three months? That's... I mean, I guess that's better than nothing. But is that the best you can do?

Agent: Let me be honest with you—that's really the best promotional offer I have access to right now in our system. I could note your account for a loyalty review, and you might be eligible for something more substantial down the road, but I can't guarantee anything. Would you like me to go ahead with the three-month credit?

Customer: (hesitant) ...Yeah, okay. Yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Excellent. So I'm going to apply that $10 monthly credit for three months starting with your next bill. You should see that reflected immediately. And I'm also removing the $25 equipment fee, so your next bill should actually show a credit of $35 total once everything processes.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you taking care of this.

Agent: Great, well thank you for being a Frontier customer, David. We really appreciate your business. If you have any other issues, feel free to give us a call back. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Thanks again.

Agent: Bye now.
