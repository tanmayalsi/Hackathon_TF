Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Or actually, I mean I recognize it, but it's way more than what I was paying before, and nobody told me about any price increase.

Agent: I understand your concern. Let me pull up your account really quick so I can take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your account here... Let me just... (pause) Alright, I see you're on our Gigabit Fiber plan. Can you tell me what amount you were expecting to pay and what you're seeing on this month's bill?

Customer: Well, for the past year, my bill has been $79.99 a month. That was the promotional rate they gave me when I signed up. But this month, the bill jumped to $119.99. That's like... that's forty bucks more. That's crazy.

Agent: Yeah, I can see why that would be frustrating. Let me check the notes on your account here. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional pricing period ended on the 15th of last month. So this current bill cycle reflects our standard pricing for the Gigabit Fiber plan, which is $119.99 a month.

Customer: Well, I don't remember being told about that. Don't you guys have to notify people before you raise their rates? I feel like I should've gotten something in the mail or an email or something.

Agent: That's a really good question. We do send out notifications, typically about 30 days before the promotional rate expires. Let me see... (typing sounds) Can you confirm the email address we have on file? Is it still [email protected]?

Customer: Uh, well... yeah, that's my email, but I don't remember seeing anything. But honestly, between work and everything, I might have missed it. That said, I still think this is pretty steep. I was looking at what I'm paying now compared to what I was paying before, and I mean... is there anything you can do about this?

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from. Let me see what options we have available. (pause, typing sounds) So, we do have some options. I could potentially apply a loyalty credit for a few months to help ease you into the new rate. What I'm seeing here is I could give you a $15 credit for the next three months if you'd like to stay with us.

Customer: Fifteen dollars? For three months? So that's like... $45 total? That still doesn't really make up for going from eighty bucks to almost a hundred twenty.

Agent: I hear you. Let me see if there's anything else I can... (pause) Actually, I'm looking at our current promotional packages, and we do have a promotion running right now where we can offer three months at $89.99 if you're willing to commit to a new two-year service agreement. That's still lower than the standard rate, and it would save you some money compared to what you're seeing now.

Customer: So you want me to sign a new two-year contract?

Agent: I know that's not ideal, but it would get you back down closer to what you were paying before. It's $89.99 instead of the $79.99, so you'd only be up about ten bucks, and it would be locked in for two years. After that, we can talk about options again.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) What happens after the two years? Do I get another rate increase?

Agent: That's a possibility, yes. After the promotional period ends, you would go back to our standard rate, which could be different by then. But we would notify you before that happens, just like we should have this time.

Customer: (sighs) I don't know, man. I'm not really thrilled about being locked in. Can I think about it?

Agent: Absolutely. You don't have to decide right now. What I can do is I can make a note here on your account that you're considering this promotion, and I can extend these options for you for... let's say 14 days. Would that work?

Customer: Yeah, okay. That works. But in the meantime, what about this month's bill? The one I'm getting charged $119.99 for?

Agent: That's a fair question. Unfortunately, since the promotional period had ended before the bill cycle, I'm not able to reverse that charge. However, if you do decide to go with the new promotion, that credit would apply starting with your next billing cycle, so you'd see the savings right away.

Customer: Alright, I guess that's fair. So I have two weeks to decide?

Agent: Exactly. Two weeks. And if you have any questions in the meantime, just give us a call back and ask for me, or any of my colleagues can help. We're here 24/7.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate it, Derek. I'll think about it and probably call back in a few days.

Agent: Sounds great. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks for your help.

Agent: Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
