Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm really frustrated with my bill. I was charged way more than I should have been this month, and I need to figure out what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. My name is Sarah Mitchell.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Sarah, let me pull that up here... Got it. I see your account. So you mentioned your bill was higher than expected. Can you tell me a little more about what you're seeing?

Customer: Well, my bill has been... I mean, I've been paying $89.99 a month for the past year and a half for the Fiber 300 plan. And this month—I just opened it yesterday—and it's $129.99. That's a forty-dollar increase! I didn't authorize any changes or anything. Nobody called me.

Agent: I understand how frustrating that would be. Let me take a look at what happened here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history... I see. So it looks like your promotional rate expired at the end of last month.

Customer: Promotional rate? What promotional rate? I didn't sign up for anything promotional. I thought I was on a regular plan.

Agent: I completely understand the confusion. So when you first signed up, you were enrolled in a twelve-month promotional rate of $89.99 per month. That promotion ended as of the end of last billing cycle, and your rate has moved to our standard Fiber 300 rate, which is $129.99.

Customer: But... nobody told me about this. Shouldn't you guys have sent me a notice or something? An email? Something?

Agent: That's a really good question, and I apologize that you feel blindsided by this. We do send out notifications, typically via email and regular mail, about thirty days before a promotional rate expires. Let me check your account notes here to see if there's anything documented... (typing sounds) I'm not seeing a note that a notification was sent, so it's possible something didn't go through on our end, and I sincerely apologize for that.

Customer: Okay, well, that's... I mean, that's not great. So what can you do about this? Because I can't just start paying an extra forty dollars a month. That's not happening.

Agent: I completely understand, and I want to help you find a solution. Let me see what options we have available for you right now. (pause) Okay, so I have a couple of things I can do. First, I can apply a one-time courtesy credit of $40 to your current bill to offset this increase. But also, I'm looking at some promotions we have running right now, and I can actually get you into a new twelve-month promotional rate.

Customer: Okay... What rate?

Agent: So we have a promotion running right now where I can put you on our Fiber 300 plan at $99.99 per month for twelve months. So that's $10 more than what you were paying before, but it's thirty dollars less than the standard rate you were just bumped to.

Customer: (pause) So you're saying I'd be paying $99.99 going forward, but you'd credit me the $40 for this month?

Agent: Exactly. So your bill this month would be $89.99—the promotional rate of $129.99 minus the $40 courtesy credit. And then starting next month, your rate would be $99.99 for the next twelve months.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) I mean, that's better than $129.99, but I'm still upset that I wasn't notified. I've been a customer for... how long have I been with you guys?

Agent: (typing sounds) It looks like you've been with us for about two and a half years. And I really do apologize about the notification issue. That shouldn't have happened. Can I ask—is there anything else I can do to help make this right?

Customer: I... (pause) I don't know. I feel like $99.99 is more than I should be paying for the plan I had. Can you do any better than that?

Agent: That's a fair point. Let me see what I can do here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm not able to go lower than $99.99 on the Fiber 300 plan with our current promotions, but what I can do is extend the $40 courtesy credit, and I can also add a three-month extension to your promotional rate. So instead of the promo ending in twelve months, it would go for fifteen months at that $99.99 rate.

Customer: So that's fifteen months at $99.99, and I get the $40 credit on this bill?

Agent: That's correct. And I really do apologize again for the notification not going through. That's on us, and we should have done better there.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay. I mean, that's... that's acceptable, I guess. But if this happens again—if I'm not notified before something changes—I'm going to have a real problem. I might even look at switching providers.

Agent: I absolutely understand, and I appreciate your patience here. Let me put a note on your account right now to make sure we send you a reminder ninety days before your promotional rate expires next time. And I'll also flag this as a courtesy adjustment so my supervisor can see that we've made it right on our end.

Customer: Okay. Okay, thank you. I appreciate that.

Agent: Of course. So just to recap what I've done for you today: I've applied a $40 one-time courtesy credit to your current bill, enrolled you in our Fiber 300 promotional rate of $99.99 for fifteen months, and I've added a note to your account to send you a reminder notification before that expires. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... that's everything. I just, again, I'd really appreciate it if you guys made sure that notification goes out. Email is probably best.

Agent: Absolutely. I've got a note on there to send you an email notification ninety days before your rate changes. You should receive that in twelve months from now. And Sarah, I want to thank you for being a customer with us for the past two and a half years. We really appreciate your business.

Customer: Thank you. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with before we go?

Customer: No, that's all. Thank you.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
