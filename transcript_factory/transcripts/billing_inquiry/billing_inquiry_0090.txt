Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm seeing a charge that I don't think should be there. My bill went up like thirty dollars this month and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up right now. And just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account here. I can see your bill from this month. So you mentioned it went up about thirty dollars?

Customer: Yeah, it's like forty-two dollars more than last month actually. Last month I paid one hundred nineteen, and this month it's one hundred sixty-one. That's... that's not normal, right?

Agent: I understand your concern. Let me take a closer look at what changed. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing... it looks like you were on our promotional rate for the first twelve months, and that promotion ended on your account last week. So your service has moved to our standard pricing for fiber internet.

Customer: What? I wasn't told about this. Like, nobody called me or sent me a letter or anything. I would've... I don't know, I would've done something about it if I knew.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check what your promotional rate was versus what you're being charged now. (pause) So you were at 89.99 a month for our 500 megabit fiber plan, and now you're being transitioned to 119.99 for the same service. Plus there's a... it looks like there's also a ten dollar equipment fee that's new on this bill.

Customer: Equipment fee? I'm not renting anything new. I've had the same router since I got the service installed.

Agent: Right, that's a good question. Let me see what that's about. (typing sounds) Hmm, it looks like that might be... actually, I think there was a system error. Let me look into that a bit more. But in terms of the price increase from the promotion ending, that's something we should have communicated to you better. You're absolutely right about that.

Customer: So is there anything you can do? Like, is there any way to keep me on that rate or get me a better deal? I've been a customer for almost two years now, and the service has been good, but I can't just absorb a forty dollar increase every month.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so here's what I can do. Since you weren't properly notified about the promotion ending, I can credit back the difference from this month—that would be about thirty dollars—and I can put you on a loyalty rate for the next twelve months. That would bring you to 99.99 a month for the same 500 meg service.

Customer: So I'd go from 89.99 to 99.99?

Agent: That's correct. That's ten dollars more than your promotional rate, but it's significantly less than the standard 119.99. And that would be locked in for the next year. Plus, I'm going to remove that equipment fee that shouldn't be on there.

Customer: (pause) Okay, um, that's better. But I mean, I'm still paying more, you know?

Agent: I hear you. And I'm sorry we didn't communicate this better to you. The loyalty rate is really the best I can offer on the account right now, but if you'd like, I can make a note on your account that you're interested in any promotions or deals we might have coming up in the future.

Customer: Yeah, sure, do that. But I want to make sure this rate is actually locked in. Last thing I need is another surprise.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to send this to you in writing via email at the email address we have on file. You'll get that within the next couple hours, and it'll show the new rate, the credit for this month, and the removal of that equipment fee. The loyalty rate will be active starting next billing cycle.

Customer: What email do we have on file? Because I might not check that email very often.

Agent: (typing sounds) It looks like we have... [inaudible]@gmail.com. Is that still the best number to reach you at?

Customer: Um, actually, no. Can you update that? My work email is better. It's stephanie.morrison@techincorp.com.

Agent: Perfect, let me get that updated for you. (typing sounds) Okay, stephanie.morrison@techincorp.com. Got it. So you'll receive the confirmation there. And just to recap—I've applied a thirty-dollar credit to your account for this month, I've removed the ten-dollar equipment fee, and I've enrolled you in our twelve-month loyalty rate at 99.99 a month starting with your next bill.

Customer: Okay. And just so I'm clear, after the twelve months, am I going back to the 119.99?

Agent: That's a good question to ask. Yes, after the twelve months, if you don't have another promotion or plan in place, it would default to the standard rate. But like I said, I'll make sure there's a note on the account about future promotions, and you can always call us back before that rate ends to see what options are available.

Customer: Right. Okay, well, I appreciate you taking care of this, Marcus. I still think you guys should've been more upfront about the promotion ending, but I'm... I'm okay with this for now.

Agent: I really appreciate that, and I'm sorry again about the lack of communication. We definitely should've done better there. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks.

Agent: You're all set. Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and thanks for being a loyal customer. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
