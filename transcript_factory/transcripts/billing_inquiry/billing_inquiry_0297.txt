Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my monthly bill just went up like twenty dollars. I've been with you guys for three years and I don't think I authorized any of this.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. Got you here. So you're saying your bill increased and there's a charge you don't recognize? Let me take a look at what we're seeing. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your current bill. I see your monthly service charge is now $79.99, is that what you're referring to when you say it went up?

Customer: Yeah, that's part of it. I mean, I was paying $59.99 before. That's a twenty dollar increase right there. But there's also... let me see... there's a charge for $14.99 that says "Premium Wi-Fi Boost" or something. I never ordered that.

Agent: Okay, I see both of those items. Let me explain what happened here. It looks like on March 15th, our system shows that Premium Wi-Fi Boost was added to your account. That's an optional service that enhances your Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home. Did you perhaps... do you remember calling in or maybe speaking with someone about upgrading your service around that time?

Customer: No, absolutely not. I didn't call anybody. That's the thing. I definitely didn't authorize that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me check the notes here. (pause) Hmm, it doesn't look like there's a note indicating how this was added. I apologize for that. That's concerning. Let me remove that charge for you right away since you didn't authorize it. But first, let me address the increase to your base service. That increase from $59.99 to $79.99 is due to a rate adjustment that went into effect on March 1st in your service area. That was actually something that should've been notified to you... did you receive any kind of notice in the mail about that?

Customer: I might've gotten something, but you know, so much mail comes in... I wasn't really paying attention to it. So you're saying that's just a price increase? There's nothing I can do about that?

Agent: I understand. Unfortunately, that rate adjustment is in effect across your area, so it does apply to all our customers in that region. However, what I can do is I can definitely remove this Premium Wi-Fi Boost charge. That should be $14.99 off your bill going forward, which is a start.

Customer: Well, I mean... that helps, but I'm still paying twenty dollars more than I was before. Is there anything I can do about the base rate increase? Any promotions or... I don't know, loyalty discounts or anything?

Agent: (pause) That's a good question. Let me look at what options we have available for you. You mentioned you've been with us for three years?

Customer: Yeah, almost exactly three years now.

Agent: That's great. We definitely appreciate your loyalty. Let me see here... (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at our current promotions. We do have a twelve-month promotional rate that I could apply to your account. It wouldn't take you all the way back to the $59.99, but I could get you down to $69.99 per month for the next year. After that year, it would go back to the regular rate, which would be $79.99 at that time.

Customer: So I'm saving ten dollars a month for a year, and then it goes back up?

Agent: That's correct, yes. After the twelve-month promotional period ends, the rate would return to the $79.99.

Customer: (sighs) I mean, it's not ideal, but at least that's something. Yeah, okay, I'll take that.

Agent: Perfect. Let me get that set up for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm applying the twelve-month promo rate now. So to recap what we're doing here: I'm removing the $14.99 Premium Wi-Fi Boost charge that was added without your authorization, and I'm applying a promotional rate of $69.99 per month for the next twelve months. After that, it'll adjust to the standard rate. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. And you'll send me a confirmation or something?

Agent: Absolutely. You'll receive an updated billing statement within the next couple of days reflecting these changes, and you'll also get an email confirmation of the promotional rate adjustment. Is the email on file still james.mitchell@email.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's still good.

Agent: Excellent. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for taking care of that for me.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. I apologize again for the confusion with that Premium Wi-Fi Boost charge. If you have any questions going forward, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks for choosing Frontier Communications, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Take care!
