Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. It's like... it went up like thirty bucks all of a sudden and I'm not sure why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you figure that out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. One second... And just to verify, is this account under the name Michael Torres?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And you're saying you noticed an increase on your most recent bill?

Customer: Yeah, this month it jumped from like ninety-nine ninety-five to a hundred thirty. That's a pretty big jump for no reason. I haven't added any services or anything.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me take a look here at what happened. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing that you have our Fiber 500 plan... and it looks like you had a promotional rate that expired at the end of last month.

Customer: What? I didn't... I mean, nobody told me about that. I've had this plan for like three years.

Agent: I apologize for that. It looks like you were on a twelve-month promotional pricing of $99.95 a month, and that promotion ended with your last billing cycle. Your regular rate for the Fiber 500 plan is $129.99 per month, which is what you're being charged now.

Customer: So you're just... you're just raising my price after three years? How is that fair? I'm a loyal customer.

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate your loyalty. These promotional rates are typically for an introductory period, and unfortunately they do expire. However, I do have some options that might help. Let me see what we have available right now. (pause, typing sounds)

Customer: Okay, well... I mean, what are my options exactly? Because if it's just going to keep going up, I might as well switch to somebody else.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check what we can do here. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that we do have a current promotion I can apply to your account. We have a six-month rate lock at $109.99 a month, which would bring your bill down from the $129.99. After that six-month period, the rate would go back to the standard price unless another promotion is available.

Customer: So it's still going to be higher than what I was paying before.

Agent: Yes, that's correct. The introductory rate of $99.95 was specifically limited to that first twelve months. However, the $109.99 is a significant savings from the current $129.99 rate, and it locks in your price for the next six months so you won't see any surprises.

Customer: (sighs) Is there anything else you can do? Like, can you match my old price or something?

Agent: Let me check what's available to me here. (pause, typing sounds) Unfortunately, I'm not able to go below the promotional rate of $109.99. That's the best I can currently offer on your account. But I want to be upfront with you—you could always call back in six months and we can look at what promotions might be available at that time.

Customer: (pause) Okay, well... I mean, I guess that's better than paying an extra thirty dollars. But this is kind of frustrating. You know, you should really let customers know when their promotional rates are ending.

Agent: You know, that's really valid feedback, and I appreciate you bringing that up. You should have received a notification about the expiring promotion. Let me make a note on your account that you didn't receive proper notification, and I'm going to apply this promotional rate for you as a courtesy. I'm also going to add a courtesy credit of $20 to your account for this month to help offset the increase.

Customer: (pause) Really? Okay, well, I... that actually helps. Thank you for that. So I'm going to see the lower rate starting next month?

Agent: Yes. The $109.99 rate will start on your next billing cycle, and the $20 credit will appear on this month's bill. It should bring your amount due down to around $110. And that rate is locked in for the next six months.

Customer: Okay, yeah, I appreciate that. That's much better. So my service isn't changing at all, right? I'm still getting the same internet speed?

Agent: That's correct. You'll keep your Fiber 500 plan with the same speeds and service. Nothing changes except the pricing. You'll actually be getting a great rate locked in for the next six months.

Customer: Alright. And you said I can call back in six months to see if there's anything else available?

Agent: Absolutely. That's a great idea. Things change all the time with our promotions, so it's definitely worth calling back around that time to see what we might have available for you at that point.

Customer: Okay, well, I appreciate your help with this. I was pretty upset when I called in, but this is much better.

Agent: I'm really glad I could help, and I sincerely apologize again that you didn't get the notification about the expiring promotion. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, Michael, and have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
