Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and something doesn't add up.

Agent: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. The account's under Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Jennifer, I'm pulling that up now. One moment... Alright, I've got your account here. What seems to be the issue with your bill?

Customer: Well, I've been a customer for about three years now, and my internet bill has always been $79.99 a month. But this month I got my statement and it jumped up to $94.99. That's a fifteen dollar increase! Nobody called me or sent me anything about a price hike. I want to know why.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Jennifer. That is a significant jump, and I can see why you'd want clarification. Let me take a look at what changed on your account. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at your service history here. You've been on our Fiber 300 plan this whole time?

Customer: Yes, that's right. 300 megabits per second. Never had any issues with it either.

Agent: Right, and that plan was $79.99. So what I'm seeing here is... it looks like there was a promotional rate that was applied to your account when you signed up. That promotional pricing expired at the end of last month, so your rate has gone to the standard pricing for that plan, which is $94.99.

Customer: (sighs) A promotional rate? I was never told about any expiration date. I thought that was just my regular price. Why wouldn't someone notify me before it went up?

Agent: That's a really fair question, and I appreciate you bringing this up. You should have received a notification about the promotional expiration—typically we send those out about 30 days before the change takes effect. Did you happen to receive anything in the mail or email from us?

Customer: I... I don't know. I might have, but honestly, I get so much mail. I probably threw it out without reading it. (pause) But still, fifteen dollars is a lot. Is there anything you can do about this? Can I get a discount or something?

Agent: Let me see what options are available to you. (typing sounds) So, I'm looking at your account history. You've been a great customer—no late payments, no service issues. Let me check what promotions we currently have available... (pause) Okay, so I can offer you a few options here. 

We have a loyalty promotion where I can bring your rate down to $84.99 for the next 12 months. That would be a discount off the standard rate.

Customer: So I'd still be paying five more dollars than I was before though.

Agent: Yes, that's correct. The promotional rate you had before was a limited-time offer for new customers. However, I want to be transparent with you—I can also see if we have any other plans that might work for you. We do have our Fiber 200 plan, which is $69.99 per month, if you'd be willing to go down slightly in speeds.

Customer: I don't really want to downgrade my speed though. I use that bandwidth, especially with my kids doing online school now. How much would that loyalty promotion be again?

Agent: That would be $84.99 per month for 12 months. After that, it would go back to the standard rate of $94.99 unless something else is available at that time.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. Can you do better than that? I mean, I've been paying you guys for three years now.

Agent: I understand, and I really do appreciate your loyalty. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) (pause) Alright, I'm going to check with my supervisor—just one moment, okay? I'm going to put you on a brief hold.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (hold music for approximately 30 seconds)

Agent: Thank you for holding, Jennifer. I spoke with my supervisor, and because of your excellent payment history and being a loyal customer for three years, I can actually offer you $82.99 per month for the next 18 months. How does that sound?

Customer: $82.99? (pause) That's... yeah, that's better. That's closer to what I was paying before. I can live with that.

Agent: Great! I'm going to apply that promotion to your account right now. (typing sounds) And I'm also going to make a note here that we should have sent you better notification about the promotional expiration. I'll flag that so our retention team is aware.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. So when will this take effect?

Agent: It will take effect on your next billing cycle, which would be... (typing sounds) ...next Tuesday, the 14th. You should see the updated charge on your statement. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... actually, that's it. Thanks for working with me on this, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business. If you need anything else in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Will do. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, Jennifer. Take care!
