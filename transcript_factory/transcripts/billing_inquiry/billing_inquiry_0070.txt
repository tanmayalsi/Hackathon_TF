# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm pretty upset about it. My internet bill basically went up like forty dollars and nobody told me about this.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And just to confirm, what's the name on the account?

Customer: Robert Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it, Robert. I'm looking at your account here. So I can see your previous bill was $79.99 a month, and your current bill is $119.95. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, that's exactly it. That's almost fifty percent more! I've been a customer for three years and I never got any notice about this. I mean, what changed? Did you guys just decide to raise my rates?

Agent: I completely understand your concern, Robert. Let me take a look at what happened here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you were on a promotional rate for your first two years. That was our new customer promotion, which gave you a discount on the Fiber 100 plan. That promotion ended last month, so you're now on our standard pricing.

Customer: A promotional rate? I don't remember that being promotional. I thought that was just... I mean, nobody explained that to me when I signed up.

Agent: I appreciate that. And I'm looking at your account notes here, and it does show that the promotional terms were included in your service agreement when you first set up your account. However, I understand that's frustrating when it expires and the bill changes. Did you receive any notifications before the change?

Customer: (pause) Well, I mean... I probably got something in the mail, but I don't know. I get so much stuff. But honestly, the point is I was paying eighty bucks and now I'm paying one-twenty. That's ridiculous.

Agent: I hear you. That is a significant jump. Let me see what options I have available for you. (typing sounds) So, we do have some promotional offers available to existing customers. I could actually put you on our three-year plan at $89.99 per month for the first year. That would be lower than your original rate, actually.

Customer: Wait, really? Why would that be different from what I'm paying now?

Agent: So that's one of our retention offers for customers who've been with us and are considering switching providers. I can apply that to your account right now if you'd like. It would lock you in at that rate for a year, and then it would move to our standard pricing after that, which I would notify you about in advance.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so I'm going down to eighty-nine, ninety-nine for a year. Then after that, what happens? It goes back up to one-twenty?

Agent: After the first year, the standard rate for that plan would be $109.99. So it would be higher than the promotional rate, but still less than where you are now.

Customer: Hmm. But why do I have to be on a three-year contract? Can't I just... I don't know, go month to month at the lower rate?

Agent: That's a good question. The promotional pricing is specifically tied to a service commitment. It's how we're able to offer that discount to existing customers. Month to month, we'd have to keep you at the standard rate of $119.95.

Customer: This is frustrating. I feel like I'm being punished for being a loyal customer. When I first signed up, you guys were so happy to have me. Now that the promotion ended, it's like... (trailing off) Look, can I think about it?

Agent: Absolutely, Robert. I completely understand. Let me note your account here that we discussed this. (typing sounds) I'm putting a note that we offered you the $89.99 promotional rate. Typically, this offer is valid for the next thirty days. So if you want to take advantage of it, just give us a call back within thirty days and we can get that set up.

Customer: Okay. And if I decide not to do that, I'm just stuck at the one-twenty?

Agent: Well, that's the standard rate right now, yes. But I would encourage you to call back. We do have options available, and I'd hate for you to lose out on the savings we can offer.

Customer: Alright. Um, is there anything else you can do on my end right now? Like, a one-time credit or something?

Agent: (pause) You know what, let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) I can apply a one-time account credit of $20 to your current bill. That would help offset some of this increase. Would that be helpful?

Customer: I mean... yeah, that's better than nothing, I guess. Sure.

Agent: Great. I'm going to apply that credit right now. It should appear on your next bill. (typing sounds) Perfect, that's all set. You should see that reflected on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay. So I'll think about that three-year thing and call back if I want it?

Agent: Exactly. Just have your account number ready when you call, and it'll be quick. Any of our representatives can help you set that up. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for your help, Marcus. I appreciate you doing the credit thing, at least.

Agent: You're very welcome, Robert. I really do appreciate your business, and I hope you'll take advantage of that retention offer. If you have any questions in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
