Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I don't know, something doesn't look right. My bill jumped up like thirty dollars since last month and I want to know why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about a charge. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... uh, 555-0847. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get your name please?

Customer: It's James. James Martinez.

Agent: (pause) Great, James. Let me pull up your account here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your most recent bill. So your previous bill was for $89.99, and your current bill is showing at $119.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. That's thirty dollars more. And I don't know... did my plan change or something? I haven't done anything different. I'm still using the same internet plan I've had for like two years.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me see here... (pause, typing) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history. It looks like you were on our Frontier Fiber 100 plan with a promotional rate of $79.99 a month. That promotional period expired last month, so your rate adjusted to the standard pricing for that plan, which is $109.99.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. I was on a promo? I wasn't... nobody told me about that. When did that... how long was the promo supposed to last?

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check the details on that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so the promotion was active for twelve months from your activation date, which was back in March of 2022. So the promo period actually ended... it looks like it ended back in March of this year.

Customer: But I've been paying $89.99 since then. I just got the increase now.

Agent: (pause) That's a good point. Let me... let me look into this a bit more. It's possible there was a delay in the system processing the rate change. (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like— oh, I see here. There was actually a service credit applied to your account for the past few months that was masking the rate increase. That credit just expired, so now you're seeing the full standard rate.

Customer: A credit? What credit? I didn't request any credit. Why would there be a credit on my account?

Agent: That's a great question. It's not clear in the notes here, but it looks like it may have been applied as a courtesy, possibly from a previous interaction or billing inquiry. Unfortunately, I don't have the specific details about why it was added.

Customer: (frustrated) This is ridiculous. So essentially, I've been getting a discount this whole time without knowing about it, and now that it's gone, my bill jumps up thirty dollars. That's not fair. You guys should have notified me about the promo ending.

Agent: I hear you, James, and I really do apologize for the confusion here. You're right that we should have been clearer about the promotional period. Let me see what options I have available for you. (typing sounds, longer pause) Okay, so looking at current promotions, I can offer you our Fiber 200 plan at $99.99 a month, which would actually give you faster speeds than you're currently getting, and it would be just ten dollars more than your previous bill.

Customer: So I can upgrade to a faster plan and only pay ten dollars more than what I was paying with the credit?

Agent: That's correct. The Fiber 200 plan is $99.99 a month for the first twelve months, and then it would go to the standard rate after that promotion expires. But you'd have the faster speeds in the meantime, and it's closer to your original bill.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. And you're saying the promo for that is for twelve months?

Agent: Yes, that's right. Twelve months at $99.99, and this time I'll make sure there's a note on your account that the promotion ends on [inaudible] 2025, so you won't be surprised like this again.

Customer: Okay... I guess that's better than paying $119.99. But I'm still not happy about not being told about the original promo ending. This feels like a bait and switch.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for that experience. We should have communicated that change more clearly to you. Is there anything else I can help clarify about the new promotion or your account?

Customer: No, I think that's... I mean, I'll take the upgrade. Just make sure you send me something in writing about when this promo ends. I don't want to be surprised again.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to make a detailed note on your account right now, and you'll receive a confirmation email within the next few minutes with all the details of your new plan and the promotion end date. The changes will be reflected on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay. Thank you.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications. We appreciate your business, and I apologize again for the confusion. Have a great day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.
