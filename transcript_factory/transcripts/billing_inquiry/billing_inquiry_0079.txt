Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like thirty dollars from last month, which is... that's a lot.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your charges. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm looking at your account for... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. I've got your account open. So you mentioned your bill went up about thirty dollars. Let me see here... (pause) I do see that your current bill is $127.99, and it looks like last month was $98.50. So yes, there is an increase there. Can you tell me which specific charge is standing out to you?

Customer: Well, the whole thing, honestly. But there's like a $29.99 charge that I don't remember agreeing to, and then my internet package itself seems higher. I've been a customer for like four years, and I never saw anything about a price increase before now.

Agent: I understand, and I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. Let me explain what I'm seeing here. (typing sounds) So the $29.99 charge—do you happen to see that on the line items?

Customer: Yeah, let me look... it says "Premium WiFi Mesh System - Monthly Service."

Agent: Ah, okay. (pause) I see that now. Robert, looking at your account history, it appears that on March 15th, a WiFi mesh system was added to your account. Do you recall that happening? Maybe an upgrade we discussed?

Customer: No, I don't... I mean, nobody called me about that. And I definitely didn't authorize that. I have my own router that works just fine.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me look at the notes here... (typing sounds) I'm not seeing any notes from a sales representative about this, so let me be completely honest with you—I'm not sure how this got added. That's concerning. But the good news is, if you didn't request that service, we can absolutely remove it for you right now.

Customer: Okay, yes, please do that.

Agent: Done. (typing sounds) I've removed the Premium WiFi Mesh System from your account, effective immediately. You won't be charged for that going forward. So that takes care of the $29.99.

Customer: Okay, good. But what about the rest of the increase? My base internet package went up too, didn't it?

Agent: (pause) Yes, you're right to call that out. Let me explain what I'm seeing. You're currently on our Fiber 500 plan at... (typing sounds) $74.99 per month. Let me check your previous pricing... (longer pause) I see. So back in January, that same plan was $64.99. So there's been a $10 increase there.

Customer: Right, so what's that about? I never got a notice or anything. Do you guys just raise prices whenever you want?

Agent: I completely understand why that would be frustrating. We do make adjustments to our pricing from time to time, but you're right that customers should receive notification. Let me pull up whether a notice was sent to you... (typing sounds) It looks like a notification was mailed to the address on file on February 20th, so it would have been—

Customer: I don't remember getting anything like that. And honestly, I didn't agree to any price increase anyway. I was fine with what I was paying.

Agent: I hear you. Look, I want to make this right. Let me see what options I have here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I can't reverse the price increase that already went into effect, but what I can do is offer you a promotional rate. I can lock you in at $69.99 per month for the next twelve months, which is basically splitting the difference. That would be five dollars more than what you were paying originally, but it's significantly better than the $74.99 you're paying now.

Customer: (pause) So I'd save like sixty dollars over the year?

Agent: Exactly. That would be correct. And after the twelve months, we can revisit and see if there are any other promotions available at that time.

Customer: Hmm... I guess that's something. But I'm still not happy about this. I feel like I'm being nickel and dimed here. Why should I stay with Frontier if you're just going to keep raising my rates?

Agent: That's a fair question, Robert, and I don't want to lose you as a customer. You've been with us for four years, and that loyalty matters. The reality is, fiber internet is a significant investment on our end, and costs do increase. But I want to make sure we're taking care of you. Beyond this promotional rate, is there anything else I can help with today? Do you have any service issues, or...?

Customer: No, the internet service itself has been fine. No complaints there.

Agent: Good, I'm glad to hear that. So let me just confirm what we've done today. I've removed the WiFi mesh system charge, which saves you twenty-nine ninety-nine per month, and I've applied a promotional rate of sixty-nine ninety-nine for your Fiber 500 service for the next twelve months. Your new bill should be around $74.98 starting next billing cycle. Does that sound acceptable?

Customer: Yeah, okay. I mean, it's not perfect, but it's better than what I saw on this bill.

Agent: I really appreciate you working with me on this. I'm going to make a note in your account that you were concerned about the price increase, and we'll make sure to give you a heads up before any future changes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. But maybe next time, you guys could send the notices a little earlier or call or something.

Agent: That's fair feedback, and I'll make sure that gets documented. Thanks for bringing it to our attention. You should see those changes reflected on your next bill. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, Robert. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
