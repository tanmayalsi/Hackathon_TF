Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and my internet service just went up like thirty dollars. I've been a customer for three years and nobody told me about any price increase. This seems really unfair.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I completely understand. Let me pull up your account here so I can take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. And yeah, I'm just... I mean, we've been loyal customers. We've paid on time every single month. Why would you guys just jump the price like that without any notice?

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm bringing that up now. (pause) I see your account here under Michael Chen. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. Let me just review your billing history here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account. Can you tell me what your bill was before this month?

Customer: It was... I think around seventy-five dollars? Maybe seventy-eight? And now it's showing one hundred and eight dollars. That's a huge jump.

Agent: Yeah, that is a significant increase. Let me see what changed here. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing that you were on our promotional rate for new customers, which expired on November 30th. Is that... did you receive any notification about that?

Customer: A promotional rate? I wasn't told anything about a promotional rate. When I signed up, they just told me the price. Nobody said it was temporary or that it would go up after a certain amount of time.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for that confusion. Let me explain what happened. You were signed up for our Frontier Fiber 500 plan at a promotional rate of $75.99 per month for twelve months. That promotion ended, and now you're on the regular rate of $108.99 for that same plan.

Customer: But that's... I mean, that's almost fifty percent more. Nobody explained that to me when I signed up.

Agent: I hear you, and I'm looking at your account notes here. (pause) It looks like there was a mailer sent to your address about thirty days before the promotion ended, but I can see how that might have been missed. That's still not ideal communication on our part.

Customer: Well, I didn't get anything. Or maybe I did and threw it away. But the point is, I don't think I should be charged this much more if I wasn't clearly told about it.

Agent: That's a fair point. Let me see what options I have for you. (typing sounds) One thing I can do is offer you another promotional rate. We currently have a special running for existing customers where I can put you back on a promotional rate of $82.99 per month for twelve months. That's not quite the original rate, but it's a significant savings compared to the regular price.

Customer: Eighty-two ninety-nine? So that's still seven dollars more than what I was paying.

Agent: Yes, it is. I understand. The reason for that is because our rates have increased overall. Materials, infrastructure costs... (pause) But I do have another option. I could also look at downgrading you to our Fiber 300 plan, which would be $69.99 per month at the promotional rate. That would actually be less than your original plan.

Customer: Wait, so I'd lose speed?

Agent: You would. The Fiber 300 provides speeds up to 300 Mbps versus the 500 Mbps you currently have. Is that something you use?

Customer: (pause) Well, I... not really. I mean, it's fine now, but... I don't know. What's the difference really?

Agent: For most households, 300 Mbps is plenty. It's great for streaming, video calls, working from home—even multiple people using the internet at the same time. You'd really only notice a difference if you were downloading large files frequently or... you know, extreme gaming or something like that.

Customer: (pause) Okay. So if I go with the 300 plan, it'd be sixty-nine ninety-nine?

Agent: That's correct. For twelve months. And then after that promotion ends, it would go to the regular price, which I think is around $94.99, but you'd get another notice about that. And honestly, at that point, you could call back and we could look at other options or promotions that might be running.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. I mean, that sounds reasonable, I guess. But I'm not happy about the way this was handled. It really should have been more clear.

Agent: I completely agree with you, and I'm sorry about that. I'm going to make a note on your account about this interaction so that future communications are clearer. Would you like me to go ahead and switch you to the Fiber 300 plan at $69.99 per month?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Let's do that. How long will it take to go into effect?

Agent: It will take effect on your next billing cycle, which would be... (typing sounds) ...December 15th. You should see the new rate on your January bill. In the meantime, you'll still be charged the $108.99 for the rest of December, but I'm going to apply a one-time credit of $29 to your account to partially offset the difference, okay? That's not perfect, but it's what I can do.

Customer: (pause) Oh. Well... okay. I appreciate that. I guess that's fair.

Agent: Great. And is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I really do think you guys should be clearer about these promotions expiring. It puts people in a bad position.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I'm going to pass this feedback along to our customer retention team. They take this stuff seriously. (pause) Your account has been updated, and you should receive a confirmation email within the next hour or so with all the details.

Customer: Okay, thank you.

Agent: Thank you for being a Frontier customer, Michael, and again, I apologize for the frustration this caused. Is there anything else before we wrap up?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: Perfect. You have a great day, and thanks for calling Frontier Communications.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
