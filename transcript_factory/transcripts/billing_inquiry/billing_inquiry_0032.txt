# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. And also, I think my rate went up? I'm pretty confused about the whole thing.

Agent: I completely understand. I'd be happy to help you sort that out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... hold on. (rustling sounds) It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. I'm pulling up your account now. Just one moment... (pause) Okay, I have your account here. I see you're on our Gigabit Fiber plan. Can you tell me what specific charges you're concerned about?

Customer: Well, first of all, my bill went from like, ninety-nine ninety-five to one hundred and thirty-seven dollars. When did that happen? I never got a notification about that.

Agent: Okay, so you're seeing an increase of about thirty-seven dollars. Let me take a look at your account history here. (typing sounds) I do show that we sent you a notification about a service plan adjustment. It looks like it was sent about thirty days ago via email. Did you happen to see that?

Customer: No, I... honestly I probably didn't read it. I get so many emails. But shouldn't you guys have told me more directly? Like, I didn't agree to any price increase.

Agent: That's a fair point, and I apologize if the notification wasn't as clear as it could have been. What happened is that your promotional pricing period ended. You've been with us for about two years now, and your introductory rate of ninety-nine ninety-five was set to expire at the end of last month. The new rate is our standard pricing for the Gigabit Fiber package in your area.

Customer: So you're saying the price just... expires? Like, that's not fair. I've been a good customer. I pay my bill on time. Can't you do anything about that?

Agent: I really do understand your frustration, and I appreciate your loyalty. Let me see what options might be available to you. (pause, typing sounds) So, what I can do is apply a loyalty discount for you. I can extend a promotional rate for another twelve months at one hundred and nine ninety-five. That would save you about twenty-seven dollars a month compared to your current rate.

Customer: Hmm... okay, well, that's... that's better, I guess. But what about after that year? Am I just going to get hit with another price increase?

Agent: That's a good question. After the twelve-month promotional period, the rate would go back to the standard rate, which may be different depending on any promotions we have running at that time. But I can make a note on your account that you'd like us to reach out to you directly before any changes take effect. That way, you'll have an opportunity to discuss options.

Customer: Okay, okay. Well, that's something, at least. But you said I also have a charge I didn't recognize. Can you look at that too?

Agent: Of course. Can you tell me what the charge is, or do you see a description on your bill?

Customer: It says... (pause) "Equipment rental—premium modem." It's like forty-nine ninety-nine. I didn't order a premium modem. I have the one you guys gave me.

Agent: (typing sounds) Ah, I see it here. It looks like about four months ago, our system shows that your modem was upgraded. Let me check the notes... (pause) I'm not seeing any specific reason for why that was done. That's unusual. Was there ever a time when you contacted us about your internet speed or had any service issues?

Customer: I mean, maybe? Like, I don't remember specifically. My internet's been pretty good, though, honestly. Can you just... can you take that off?

Agent: I can definitely help with that. Let me remove the equipment rental charge effective immediately. That's forty-nine ninety-nine per month that you won't be charged going forward. (typing sounds) Okay, that's done. And I'm also going to credit your account for the last four months of that charge. That should be about two hundred dollars back to your account.

Customer: Really? Okay, wow, that's... that's actually really helpful. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. I apologize that that charge got applied without a clear reason. Let me just confirm what we've worked out here. I'm applying a twelve-month promotional rate of one hundred and nine ninety-five per month, I'm removing the premium modem rental going forward, and I'm crediting two hundred dollars to your account for the past four months of that charge. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Um, so when will the credit show up?

Agent: The credit should be reflected on your next billing cycle, which would be in... (typing sounds) about five days. You should see everything updated then. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you, Marcus. I appreciate you taking care of that.

Agent: It's my pleasure. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I'm sorry we didn't communicate the rate change more clearly. If you have any other questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: I will. Thanks again.

Agent: Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
