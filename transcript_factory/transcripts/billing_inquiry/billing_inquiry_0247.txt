# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I don't know, something doesn't add up. My bill jumped up like forty bucks and I want to know why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you figure that out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Um, sure. It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: Jennifer Walsh.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. Let me pull up your account here. (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your most recent bill now. I can see the charge you're referring to. What was your bill amount before this most recent one?

Customer: It was like... I think it was around 89, 90 dollars? And now it's saying 129. That's... that's a huge jump. I've been a customer for what, five years? And it's been the same price the whole time.

Agent: I understand, and I can definitely see why that would be frustrating. Let me break down what I'm seeing here. (pause) Okay, so looking at your account, it looks like your promotional pricing ended on the 15th of last month.

Customer: Wait, what do you mean "promotional pricing"? I never agreed to any promotional period. I've just been paying the same thing every month.

Agent: That's a good question. Let me check when that promotional rate was set up. (typing sounds) It looks like it was applied when you first signed up about five years ago. So you had a twelve-month promotional rate for internet and TV bundle at $89.99.

Customer: Okay, but... I mean, nobody told me it was going to go up. Don't you guys send out notifications or something?

Agent: That's a great point, and I apologize. We should have notified you more clearly. (pause) So what happened is, once that promotional period ended, your rate went to our standard pricing, which for your tier of service—that's our Fiber 100 with the TV package—that comes to $129.99 a month.

Customer: So you're just... what, you're just raising my bill and expecting me to be okay with it?

Agent: I hear your frustration, Jennifer, and I'm not saying it's okay to feel blindsided. That's completely understandable. What I can do is... let me see what options we have here. (typing sounds) 

Customer: I mean, can I just go back to the lower price? Or like, is there any way to make this right?

Agent: So, I can't reinstate the exact promotional rate you had, since that was specific to when you first signed up. However, I do have some options. I can see if we have any current promotions that might apply to your account. (pause) Let me look here... Okay, so I'm seeing that we have a limited-time offer right now for existing customers. I could potentially get your rate down to $99.99 a month for the same service for the next six months.

Customer: For six months? And then what, it goes back up to 129?

Agent: That's correct. After six months, it would go to the standard rate of $129.99 unless another promotion becomes available at that time. I know that's not ideal, but—

Customer: That's... that's still not great. I mean, I liked paying what I was paying. Why can't you just keep it at the old price?

Agent: I understand, and that's a very fair question. So, the promotional pricing is really designed to attract new customers to our services. Once that period ends, we do have to move customers to our standard rates. That said, I want to do what I can for you here. Let me see if I can get you something better. (pause, longer hold) 

Customer: (background) Come on...

Agent: Jennifer, are you still there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Okay, great. So I talked to my supervisor, and I'm actually able to apply an extended promotion for you. I can lock in a rate of $109.99 a month for twelve months. That's a $20 savings compared to the standard rate.

Customer: Twelve months?

Agent: Yes, that way you have a full year to plan, and... honestly, Jennifer, you've been with us for five years. We value that loyalty, and I want to make this right.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I mean, that's better. So that's guaranteed for a year?

Agent: That's guaranteed for twelve months from today. After that, if you'd like to continue service, we'd move to standard pricing unless there's another promotion available. I'll make sure to flag your account so you get advance notice next time before any rate changes happen.

Customer: Alright. Yeah, I appreciate that. So my next bill will reflect that?

Agent: Actually, let me get that processed for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm applying that rate change... and that's all set. Your new rate of $109.99 should appear on your next billing cycle. You should see that reflected within the next week or so on your online account or in your next bill.

Customer: Okay, thank you. That's... yeah, that's much better.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: It's my pleasure, Jennifer. Thank you so much for being a loyal Frontier customer, and if you have any issues in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
