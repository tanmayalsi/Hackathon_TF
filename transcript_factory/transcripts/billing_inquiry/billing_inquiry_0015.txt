# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I just received my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, or rather, I do recognize it but it wasn't supposed to be there.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here for you. And what's the best name to have on file?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account here. So you mentioned there's a charge you're disputing. Can you tell me which charge that is and approximately how much it is?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill came to $87.99 this month, and last month it was $59.99. That's a $28 increase and nobody told me about this. I've been a customer for, I don't know, four or five years now, and my rate has never jumped like that before.

Agent: I understand your frustration, James. Let me take a look at what might have caused that increase. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that you're on our standard Gig fiber plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. The one with the gigabit speeds.

Agent: Yes, exactly. Okay, so I'm pulling up your account history. It looks like your promotional rate expired. You had a 12-month promotional pricing of $59.99 per month, and that ended at the end of last billing cycle. Your regular rate for that plan is $87.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about any promotional rate. I thought that was just my regular price.

Agent: I understand. Let me check here... (typing sounds) So according to our records, the promotional offer was included when you signed up back in 2019. Typically, customers receive notification about rate changes before the promotional period ends, but let me look at what we have documented here.

Customer: This is ridiculous. I mean, I get that you guys need to make money, but a 47% increase? That's crazy.

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate your loyalty as a customer. That is a significant jump, and I want to help find a solution for you. Let me see what options we have available. (pause, typing sounds) Are you currently under any contract, or are you month-to-month at this point?

Customer: I'm not sure. Probably month-to-month? I've had the service for so long, I honestly don't remember if there was a contract involved.

Agent: That's completely understandable. Let me check that for you. (pause) Okay, so you are currently month-to-month, which is good news. That gives us some flexibility here. I'm looking at our current promotions, and I do have some options available to you. We have a promotional rate right now for existing customers that would bring you down to $69.99 per month for 12 months.

Customer: $69.99? That's still higher than what I was paying before.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I understand that's still an increase from your promotional rate. Unfortunately, I'm not able to go back to the original $59.99 rate. However, the $69.99 is the best rate I can offer you right now, which would save you $18 per month compared to the standard rate. That's... let me do the math here... about a $216 savings over the year compared to what you'd be paying at the regular price.

Customer: (pause) I mean... I guess that's better than $87.99, but I'm still not happy about this. Why wasn't I notified that my rate was going up? Doesn't Frontier send notices about this?

Agent: That's a great question. We should have sent you a notification. Let me look at what we have on file for your contact preferences. (typing sounds) It looks like we have your mailing address on file, but I'm not seeing an email address. Is it possible the notification got lost in the mail, or...

Customer: My email is james.mitchell1975@gmail.com. But honestly, I should have gotten something. That's not really acceptable.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that. I'm going to make a note on your account about this, and I do want to apply this promotional rate to your account to make this right. However, I also want to see if there's anything else I can offer you. Can I ask... are you happy with your internet speeds and the service otherwise?

Customer: The speeds are fine. The service is fine. It's just the price that's annoying.

Agent: I understand. Well, what I can do is apply this $69.99 promotional rate for 12 months. That will bring your next bill down significantly. But I'm also going to credit your account $28 for the difference between what you were paying and what you should have been notified about. So you should see that credit on your next bill.

Customer: (pause) Really? You can do that?

Agent: Yes, I can. I want to make sure we're taking good care of you as a long-time customer. This credit isn't a standard thing, but given the circumstances with the notification issue, I think it's appropriate.

Customer: Well, that's... that's actually really helpful. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. So let me just confirm what we're doing here. I'm going to apply the promotional rate of $69.99 per month for the next 12 months, and I'm crediting your account $28 as a one-time courtesy credit. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Can you send me a confirmation email of this?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to send that to james.mitchell1975@gmail.com, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm sending that now, so you should receive it within the next 15 minutes or so. And James, I'm also going to make a note here that we need to add your email to our communication preferences so you get notified about any future rate changes or promotions. That way you won't miss out on anything.

Customer: That's good. I appreciate that.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and I really do apologize for the confusion with the rate change notification. We appreciate your business, and if you have any other issues, please don't hesitate to call us back.

Customer: Will do. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, James. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.
