# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize. It's for like, $15, and I'm not sure what it is.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at the account here for... is this Sarah Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Sarah. So I'm looking at your most recent bill from last month, and I can see the charge you're referring to. It looks like there's a $14.99 charge listed as "Premium WiFi Support." Can you tell me if you remember signing up for that service?

Customer: No, I definitely did not sign up for that. I have a Frontier router already, and my internet works fine. Why would I pay for something extra? This is the first time I'm seeing this on my bill.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me look into this a bit further. (pause) Okay, so it looks like this charge was added to your account about two months ago. Do you remember having any contact with us around that time? Maybe a phone call or... sometimes these can be added during service calls?

Customer: No, I haven't had anyone out here. I mean, I didn't call you guys either. Could this have been added by mistake? Or like, is this something that was automatically added?

Agent: That's a good question. Let me check the notes here... (typing sounds) It shows here that during an inbound call—that would have been from you, actually—on January 15th, it notes that Premium WiFi Support was offered and accepted. Does that ring a bell at all?

Customer: (pause) January 15th? I... I don't think I called. And I definitely wouldn't have agreed to pay extra for WiFi support. I don't even know what that is, honestly. My WiFi works fine.

Agent: I completely understand. And I'm looking at the service description here, and it's basically for troubleshooting and optimization of your home WiFi network—so like, if you were having connectivity issues, we could help prioritize that. But it sounds like you didn't knowingly agree to this.

Customer: Right, exactly. I think there's been some kind of mistake or miscommunication. Can you just remove it?

Agent: Absolutely. I can definitely remove that charge for you. And actually, because this appears to have been added in error, I'm going to go ahead and refund the charge from the previous two months as well. So that'll be a total credit of about $30 back to your account.

Customer: Oh, okay. Yeah, that would be great. Thank you.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm processing that now. You should see that credit applied to your next billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Sarah?

Customer: Um, actually, now that I have you on the phone... my internet bill went up last month too. It's now like $79.99 for the 400 meg plan, and I'm pretty sure I was paying $59.99 before. Did my plan change or something?

Agent: (pause) Let me check that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing that your rate did increase. Let me look at when that took effect... It looks like there was a price adjustment on your account effective January 1st. This would have been a rate increase in your service area.

Customer: So you're just... raising my rates? Without asking me?

Agent: I understand how frustrating that is. So the way our pricing works is that promotional rates typically expire after a certain period—usually 12 months—and then the standard rate applies. Looking at your account, it looks like you were on a promotional rate that ended, and your rate adjusted to the standard pricing for your area.

Customer: But I've been a customer for, like, three years. Doesn't that count for anything? (frustrated tone)

Agent: That's a great question, and I really do appreciate your loyalty. Let me see what options we have available. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so you do qualify for an existing customer retention offer. I can put you on a 12-month promotion where we can bring that rate back down to $64.99 per month. Would that help?

Customer: So I'd be saving $15 a month from what I'm paying now?

Agent: That's right, yes. $15 a month savings.

Customer: Okay, um... I guess that's better than $79.99. But I really wish you guys would have let me know this was coming before it happened.

Agent: I really do hear you on that, and I apologize that you weren't notified in advance. I'll make a note on your account. Let me go ahead and apply this promotional rate for you right now. (typing sounds) Alright, that's been applied effective immediately, so you should see that reflected on your next bill.

Customer: Okay. So to confirm—I'm getting the $30 credit for that WiFi thing, and my rate is going to be $64.99 instead of $79.99?

Agent: That's correct. Your monthly rate will be $64.99 for the next 12 months, and you have a credit of approximately $30 that will show on your next bill.

Customer: Alright. Thank you. I appreciate that.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Great. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and thank you for calling. You have a great day.

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye.
