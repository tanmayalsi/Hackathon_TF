Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I just got charged like fifty dollars more this month and I have no idea why. This is ridiculous.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. And my name is Sarah Mitchell, by the way.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Sarah, I'm pulling up your account right now. One moment... Alright, I've got you here. I can see your account, and I do notice there was a charge increase on your most recent bill. Can you tell me what your bill was running before?

Customer: It was ninety-nine ninety-five a month. That's what I've been paying for like six months. Now suddenly it's one-fifty? That's not right. Did you guys raise your rates or something?

Agent: I understand your concern. Let me take a look at the details here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate expired at the end of last month. You were on a twelve-month promotional pricing of $99.95, and that ended on March 31st. Your standard rate for our Fiber 200 plan is $149.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. What promotional rate? Nobody told me about this. I mean, I didn't... I don't remember signing up for anything temporary. I thought that was just my rate.

Agent: I understand. A lot of customers have that same experience. The promotional rate would have been outlined in your initial service agreement when you signed up. Do you happen to remember when you started service with us?

Customer: Um, like... six months ago? Maybe seven? My boyfriend set it up, actually. He might not have read all the fine print or whatever. But still, you guys should've sent me a notice or something before you just jacked up the price.

Agent: That's actually a really fair point. We do send out notifications, but I understand they can sometimes get missed or go to spam. Let me check what we have on file here. (typing sounds) Okay, so we did send you an email notification on March 15th, which was before the rate change took effect. Did you happen to see that?

Customer: I... I don't know. I get so many emails. Look, the point is, I can't afford one-fifty a month. That's too much. I've got other bills. Is there anything you can do about this?

Agent: Absolutely, I want to help. Let me see what options we have available for you right now. (pause, typing sounds) So, I can't extend the promotional rate since it's already expired, but I do have some current offers I can look at. We have a twelve-month rate lock I could apply to your account. That would bring your rate down to $119.99 per month for the next year.

Customer: $119.99? That's still more than what I was paying.

Agent: You're right, it is an increase, but it would be a thirty-dollar difference instead of fifty. After the twelve months is up, it would go back to the standard rate of $149.99 unless you choose to switch plans or if we have other promotions available at that time.

Customer: (sighs) That still doesn't feel right. I mean, why should I have to pay more? You're not giving me anything new. My internet is the same, right?

Agent: That's correct, the service is the same. And I definitely understand your frustration. This is actually a pretty common situation, and I want to be transparent with you. Pricing does change based on market conditions and the value of service, but I hear what you're saying. Let me see... (pause, typing sounds) okay, what if I could do $129.99 for twelve months? That would split the difference a bit more.

Customer: (pause) How much would that be compared to what I'm paying now?

Agent: Right now you're seeing $149.99, so this would be $129.99. That's a twenty-dollar reduction from the standard rate, so you'd be paying about thirty dollars more than your promotional rate was.

Customer: (sighs heavily) ...Okay, I mean, that's better than fifty more, but I'm still not happy about this.

Agent: I completely understand, and I appreciate your patience with me. I don't want to lose you as a customer. Is the $129.99 rate something that would work for you?

Customer: I guess it'll have to. But can you put a note on my account or something so this doesn't happen again? Like, I want to know ahead of time if my rate is about to change. And maybe you could've offered me a better deal instead of just letting it go to full price.

Agent: That's totally fair. I'm actually going to note on your account right now that you want advance notice about any rate changes. I'm also going to flag this so that when you're coming up on the end of any promotion in the future, a specialist can reach out proactively to discuss your options before the change takes effect. How does that sound?

Customer: Okay, that... that sounds good. Yeah, I appreciate that.

Agent: Great. So let me just confirm the changes I'm making. I'm applying the $129.99 rate for a twelve-month term, effective immediately. This will replace the current $149.99 charge. Your new bill should reflect this starting next month, and I'll email you a confirmation of this change right away.

Customer: Okay. And the $149.99 charge that just hit—am I getting that reversed or what?

Agent: That's a great question. Since the billing cycle just closed, we would typically issue a credit for the difference between what you were charged and the new rate. So you should see a credit of about twenty dollars on your next bill, assuming your usage is the same as this month.

Customer: Only twenty? I thought—

Agent: I apologize for the confusion. The way it works is, if your rate is being adjusted mid-cycle, we'd credit you for the difference going forward. But since the bill was already finalized when I'm making this change, the credit would apply to your next statement. However, let me see if I can do something. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm going to apply a manual credit of the full fifty-dollar difference to your account right now as a courtesy for the inconvenience and for giving us another chance.

Customer: (pause) Really? You can do that?

Agent: Yes, I can. I'm applying it now. You should see that credit on your next bill.

Customer: Well... okay. That's actually really helpful. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. I really do apologize for the frustration this caused. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Absolutely, Sarah. I'm going to send that confirmation email right over to you, and thank you so much for being a Frontier customer. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help.

Customer: Okay, thanks. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Take care!
