Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement online and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize, and honestly, my rate went up too. I'm kind of frustrated right now.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you're frustrated. I'm here to help you figure this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my landline number with you guys.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Perfect, I've got it. I'm looking at your account for [inaudible]. So you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize and also a rate increase. Let me start by asking—what charge are you seeing that seems off to you?

Customer: Okay, so on this month's bill, there's a $15 charge that just says "Equipment Rental Fee" but I don't think I should be paying that. I mean, I bought the router when I got the service three years ago. I paid for it upfront.

Agent: Okay, that's a fair question. Let me look into that for you. (pause) So I'm pulling up your equipment history here. It looks like you do have a modem that's registered to your account. Can you tell me—is it a black box, kind of rectangular shaped?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds like it. It's got the Frontier branding on it.

Agent: Okay, so here's what I'm seeing. There was an equipment rental fee on your account, but according to your notes, it should have been waived when you purchased the device outright. So this charge shouldn't be here. I'm going to make a note of that right now and get that credit issued back to you. That shouldn't have been on your bill.

Customer: Okay, good. I mean, I'm glad you can see that. But what about my rate? My bill went up like $12 a month. I'm on the 300 meg fiber plan, and last month it was $59.99 and now it's like $71.99. That's a huge jump.

Agent: (typing sounds) I hear you. Let me check what's happening with your pricing. (pause) So I'm looking at your account. It looks like you were on a promotional rate that expired. Your original promotion was a twelve-month introductory rate, and that ended last month.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about that. Why would you put me on a promotional rate without telling me it was going to expire? That's not fair.

Agent: I totally understand your frustration, and I apologize that wasn't communicated better to you. That's definitely something we should have reached out about before the promotion ended. Let me see what I can do for you here. (typing sounds) So, looking at your account... I have a few options. I can extend your current rate for another three months, which would bring us to... let's say early September. During that time, you'd stay at $59.99 a month.

Customer: Three months? And then what happens after that? Does it just jump again?

Agent: That's a fair question. After three months, if we don't have another promotion available, yes, it would revert to our standard rate, which is $71.99. However, I would make a note on your account requesting that our retention team give you a call before that happens so you're not blindsided again. And there's a decent chance we'll have promotional pricing available at that time as well.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I mean, I guess that's better than nothing. But I'm not thrilled about this. I've been a customer for three years. You'd think there'd be some loyalty pricing or something.

Agent: You know what, let me check one more thing. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so because you've been a loyal customer, and to make up for the equipment fee that shouldn't have been charged, I can actually do a little bit better. I can extend your rate for four months instead of three, and I'm also going to credit you $30 to your account right now to cover that equipment fee plus a little extra for the inconvenience.

Customer: Really? Okay, well... that's actually helpful. Thank you. So I'll have the $59.99 rate through... when did you say?

Agent: Through early September. And I'm putting in the note right now for the retention team to reach out to you around that time to discuss options before any changes happen. How does that sound?

Customer: Alright, yeah. I appreciate that. And the credit will show up on my next bill?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. It should appear on your next billing statement, which should be in the next seven to ten days. And then with the rate extension, your next bill should be $59.99 plus any taxes, of course.

Customer: Okay. Good. I mean, I'm still not happy about not being told about the promo ending, but I feel better about this now.

Agent: I completely understand, and again, I apologize for that miscommunication. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. That was the main thing bothering me.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for being a customer with us for three years, and I really do apologize for the frustration. If you have any questions or issues, please don't hesitate to reach out. You have a great rest of your day.

Customer: You too. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you. Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
