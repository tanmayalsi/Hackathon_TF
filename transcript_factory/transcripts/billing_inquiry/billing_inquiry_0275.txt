Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, my name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Derek, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I mean, I've been a customer for three years now, and my internet bill just jumped up by thirty dollars. Thirty dollars! I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. That's definitely a significant increase. Let me pull up your account real quick so we can look into this together. Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. And what name is the account under?

Customer: James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I'm bringing up your account now. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your billing history here. I can see you've been with us since February 2021, and your service has been consistent. Let me check what happened with your current bill.

Customer: Right, so I was paying $79.99 a month for the gigabit fiber plan, and this month it's showing $109.99. That's... that's almost a forty percent increase! Nobody warns you about stuff like this.

Agent: I hear you, James. I'm seeing that here as well. (pause) Okay, so it looks like... it appears your promotional rate expired. It shows that you had a three-year promotional pricing of $79.99 per month, which ended with your billing cycle that started on the 15th of this month.

Customer: Wait, a promotional rate? I... I don't remember being told it was promotional. I thought that was just the regular price. How was I supposed to know it was going to jump up like this?

Agent: That's a fair point, and I apologize if that wasn't clear. Those promotional rates are typically mentioned in the initial agreement, but I understand it can be easy to overlook, especially over time. (typing sounds) Let me see what options we have available for you right now.

Customer: So basically, I'm being charged more just because I've been loyal? That doesn't make sense. I could go with one of your competitors and probably get a better deal.

Agent: I understand your frustration completely, and you're right—sometimes it does feel backwards. But I actually do have some options that might help us here. Let me look at what we can offer you. (pause) Okay, so you're currently on our Gigabit Fiber plan at $109.99. I'm seeing that we do have a loyalty promotion available right now that would bring your rate down to $89.99 per month for the next twelve months. That wouldn't be the original rate, but it's a significant savings from where you are now.

Customer: Twelve months? And then what happens after that? It goes up again?

Agent: That's a valid concern. After the twelve months, it would return to the standard rate, which is currently $109.99, unless we have additional promotions available at that time. However, I'd recommend calling back before that period ends, and we can often work something out with you again, especially given your tenure with us.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, but I mean... I'm not thrilled about this situation. I've never had to call and negotiate my bill before. Why does it have to be this complicated?

Agent: You know what, James, that's fair feedback, and I genuinely appreciate you bringing that up. I'll be honest with you—the system can feel frustrating, and I don't blame you for feeling that way. What I can do is make a note on your account that you're a long-standing customer and that you were surprised by this increase. Sometimes that helps when your next renewal comes up. I can also set a reminder for us to reach out to you proactively thirty days before this promotion ends, so you don't have to be the one to call.

Customer: Really? You can do that?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me add that to your account right now. (typing sounds) Okay, it's added. So to recap, I'm going to apply the $89.99 promotional rate for twelve months, effective immediately. That'll bring your next bill down by twenty dollars from what you just saw. And I'm setting an internal reminder for November 15th to reach out to you about options before this rate expires.

Customer: Alright, I... I appreciate that, Derek. That does help. So my bill next month should be $89.99?

Agent: Exactly right. It'll show up on your next billing cycle, which will be processed on the 15th. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you for actually listening and not giving me the runaround.

Agent: My pleasure, James. Thank you for being such a loyal customer for the past three years. We really do value that. If you have any issues with your service or billing in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you. Goodbye!
