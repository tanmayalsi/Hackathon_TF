# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I'm really confused about my bill this month. I was charged $89.99, but last month it was $59.99, and I didn't authorize any changes to my service.

Agent: I understand your concern. I'm sorry you're seeing a difference there. Let me pull up your account and take a look. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, I'm looking at your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. And you're right, I do see that your rate increased from $59.99 to $89.99 as of this billing cycle. Let me find the details on why that happened.

Customer: Yeah, that's a $30 increase. That's pretty significant. I haven't called to upgrade anything, so I want to know what's going on.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I'm pulling up your account history here. It looks like... ah, I see. So it appears that your promotional rate expired. You were on an introductory rate for the first twelve months of service, and this month marks the beginning of your standard pricing.

Customer: Wait, promotional rate? Nobody told me about this. When did I sign up for this service?

Agent: (typing sounds) Looking at your account... you signed up on May 15th of last year. So your promotional period would have ended at the end of this billing cycle, which... yes, that aligns with what we're seeing here.

Customer: That doesn't make sense. I mean, I'm looking at my original paperwork right now, and it says the rate was $59.99. There's nothing here about it going up after a year. This feels like you guys are trying to sneak an increase past me.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I want to be transparent with you—promotional rates are typically for twelve months, and that should have been outlined in your service agreement. Um, let me see if I can find information about what was sent to you at signup.

Customer: Well, I don't remember getting anything about this, and frankly, I'm not happy about it. This is a pretty big jump. What are my options here?

Agent: (pause) Let me see what I can do for you. Hold on just one second while I check what promotions we have available right now.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, so I'm looking at current offerings, and I do have some options. One thing I can do is apply a credit to your account for this month to bring you back to $59.99, and then I can look into whether we have any retention offers available to you.

Customer: A credit for just this month? That doesn't really solve the problem if it's just going to go back up next month.

Agent: Right, that's fair. Let me check for retention offers. (pause) So if you're willing to commit to another twelve months of service, I can get you back to $59.99 for the next year. After that, it would be the standard rate, but at least you'd have another year at the promotional price.

Customer: So... I have to sign a contract to keep my rate? I don't really want to be locked in. What if I want to cancel?

Agent: That's a great question. If you cancel during that promotional period, there would be... (typing sounds) ...a $99 early termination fee. I know that's not ideal. Alternatively, if you're not interested in signing another contract, I could offer you a one-time $20 monthly credit for six months, which would bring your rate down to about $69.99.

Customer: (sighs) So my options are sign a contract to get back to my original price, or take a smaller discount and pay more anyway?

Agent: I know it's not perfect, and I apologize for the frustration. Those are the options I have available in the system right now, but let me be honest with you—if you're considering leaving, you could reach out to our retention department, and they might have additional offers. They sometimes have more flexibility than I do in customer service.

Customer: You mean I have to threaten to cancel to get a decent deal?

Agent: I understand how that sounds, and I... I get your point. It's not ideal, I agree. Would you like me to transfer you to our retention team? They can review your account and see if there are any other options we haven't covered.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, actually, can you do that? And I want it noted on my account that I'm disputing this charge because I was never properly informed about this rate increase.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to put a note on your account right now indicating that you're disputing the charge and that you weren't informed about the promotional period expiration. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got that documented. Let me transfer you over to our retention team. They should be able to help you out. You might be on hold for just a moment.

Customer: How long is "just a moment"?

Agent: Usually less than two minutes, but I apologize if it's a bit longer. And just so you know, your account is flagged now, so they'll see that you've already spoken to me about this.

Customer: Alright, thank you.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Let me get you transferred over now.

Customer: Okay.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications.
