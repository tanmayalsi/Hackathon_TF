# Frontier Communications - Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that doesn't make any sense. My internet bill went up like thirty dollars a month, and nobody told me about this.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your bill. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... hold on, let me grab my bill. Okay, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, let me pull that up here. One moment, please.

(pause)

Agent: Okay, I've got your account here. I'm seeing that your service address is on Maple Street in... Boise?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. So, I'm looking at your most recent bill from last month and your current one. I can see there was indeed an increase. Can you tell me what the charge breakdown is showing on your end?

Customer: Um, yeah, it went from... it was like $89.99, and now it's $119.99. That's like a thirty-dollar jump! I've been with you guys for what, three years now? And my rate was locked in. I specifically remember asking about that when I signed up.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at your account history here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you do have our Fiber 500 plan. And... I do see here that you did have a promotional rate of $89.99 per month for 24 months.

Customer: Right, exactly. So that's still... we're not even two years in. It hasn't been 24 months yet.

Agent: (pause) Actually, looking at the account notes here, it appears that your promotional period ended on November 15th of this year. We would have sent you a notice about 30 days prior to that, which would have been mid-October.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't get any notice. I get everything else from you guys—I get the bills, I get the emails. I definitely would have remembered seeing something about my rate going up thirty bucks.

Agent: I hear you. Let me check what contact information we have on file. (typing sounds) Okay, so we have your email listed as... is it [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's my main email, but... I mean, no, I didn't see anything.

Agent: It's possible it went to spam, or there may have been a delivery issue on our end. I sincerely apologize for that. However, I am showing that the notice was sent. The rate increase reflects the end of your promotional pricing, and your account is now on our standard Fiber 500 rate, which is $119.99 per month.

Customer: But that's... that's not fair. I specifically asked about locked-in rates. This feels like a bait and switch.

Agent: I completely understand why you'd feel that way. The promotional rate was clearly specified as a 24-month promotion. Let me see what I can do here to help make this right. (pause, typing sounds) I'm going to check what options are available on your account.

Customer: Like, could I get my old rate back, or...?

Agent: That's a good question. Let me explore what retention options I have access to. (pause) Okay, so normally once a promotional period expires, the standard rates apply. However, given the situation with the notice potentially not reaching you, I might be able to offer you something. 

Customer: Okay, what kind of something?

Agent: Well, I can offer you a new promotion. I can put you on a 12-month agreement at $99.99 per month, which would be a $20 savings compared to the standard rate.

Customer: So I'd still be paying ten more dollars than I was before.

Agent: That's correct. I apologize. The thing is, once promotional pricing expires, we're not typically able to return to the previous rate. However, this new promotion would lock in your price for the next 12 months, so you wouldn't see any unexpected increases during that time.

Customer: (sighs) This is really frustrating. I feel like I'm being punished for being a loyal customer.

Agent: I really do understand your frustration, and I appreciate your loyalty over these past three years. Tell you what—let me see if I can do a little better for you. Can you hold for just one moment while I check with my supervisor on what additional options might be available?

Customer: Yeah, okay, sure.

Agent: Thank you. I'm going to put you on a brief hold.

(hold music plays)

(approximately 45 seconds of hold music)

Agent: Thank you so much for holding. Okay, so I spoke with my supervisor, and because of the situation with the notice potentially not reaching you, I'm able to offer you $99.99 per month for 24 months instead of just 12. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Okay, so... I'd be saving like $20 a month compared to what it is now?

Agent: Exactly right. And you'd have the same price protection for the next 24 months, so you wouldn't see any increases during that time.

Customer: I mean... I guess that's better. But I'm still paying more than my original rate.

Agent: I hear you, and I truly wish I could do better. If your promotional period had been communicated more clearly, we wouldn't be in this situation. But this is honestly the best option I have available to me. Would you like me to go ahead and apply that for you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Do it.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to process that right now. (typing sounds) Alright, so I've applied the 24-month promotional rate of $99.99 to your account, effective immediately. This will show up on your next billing cycle.

Customer: And there's no early termination fee or anything if I need to cancel?

Agent: There is a 24-month agreement, so if you were to cancel early, there would be an early termination fee. But as long as you keep the service, you're all set.

Customer: Okay, alright. Well, I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course. And again, I'm very sorry for the confusion with the notice. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Great. Thank you so much for calling Frontier, and we really do appreciate your business. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour or so. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks. You too.

Agent: Bye now.
