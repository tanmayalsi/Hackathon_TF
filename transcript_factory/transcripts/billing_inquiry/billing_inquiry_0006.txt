Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and I'm also pretty upset about a price increase I wasn't told about.

Agent: I understand your frustration. I'd be happy to help you sort this out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And can I get the name on the account please?

Customer: Sarah Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. I've got your account here. So you mentioned a charge you don't recognize and a price increase? Let's start with the charge first. Can you tell me which one looks unfamiliar to you?

Customer: There's a $49.99 charge labeled "Professional Installation - Service Call" from last month, and I never had anyone come out here. I definitely would've remembered that. Plus my internet bill went from $79.99 to $99.99 this month with no explanation.

Agent: Oh, okay. I see both of those on here. Let me look into this for you. (pause) So the $49.99 charge... do you remember having any service issues last month that you might've called about?

Customer: Well, I mean, I had some issues, yeah, but I didn't ask anyone to come out. I called and talked to someone and they just... I don't know, they walked me through some troubleshooting steps and it got better.

Agent: Mm-hmm. Okay, so it looks like there may have been a note on your account that a technician was scheduled, but it says here the service call was completed. That's strange. Sometimes there can be a miscommunication on our end where a technician is dispatched even though the issue was resolved over the phone. Let me see what I can do about that charge.

Customer: So you're saying that wasn't my fault? Because I really don't think I authorized that.

Agent: No, no, I'm not saying that's your fault at all. This sounds like it might've been an error on our part. I'm actually going to go ahead and remove that $49.99 charge from your account. You shouldn't have been billed for a service call you didn't request.

Customer: Oh, okay. Well, that's good. But what about the price increase? I've been a customer for like three years now, and I never got a notice or anything about my rate going up by twenty dollars.

Agent: (typing) Let me pull up your account history here. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that you're on our Fiber 100 plan. According to my notes, there was actually a rate adjustment that went into effect... looks like it was about three weeks ago? And it should've been included in your bill statement. Do you have your bill in front of you?

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

Agent: Can you see if there's like a small insert or notice in there about rate changes? Sometimes it's easy to miss because it's just a tiny little paper.

Customer: (rustling sounds) Um... yeah, actually there is something here. It says "Important Service Notice" or whatever. I guess I didn't really... I didn't read it carefully.

Agent: That would be it. I know it's frustrating when rates go up, and I totally understand that. The good news is you have options. This increase actually came along with an upgrade to our service. Your speed has been increased from 100 Mbps to 200 Mbps at no extra charge, so you are getting more for the increase.

Customer: So I didn't have a choice? Like, I have to pay more or...?

Agent: Well, [inaudible] you do have a few options. You could stay on the plan and enjoy the faster speeds, or if you'd prefer to maintain your previous bill amount, we do have our Fiber 50 plan that's $79.99, which would actually be even cheaper. Though obviously you'd have slightly lower speeds.

Customer: (pause) I don't really want to downgrade my speeds if I don't have to. I mean, I use this for streaming and stuff. Can you just... I don't know, can you work with me on the price at all? Like a promotional rate or something?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me see what I can do here. (typing) Okay, so you're a three-year loyal customer, which we definitely value. I'm going to apply a promotional credit of $10 per month to your account for the next six months. That'll bring your bill down to $89.99 and you'll keep those upgraded speeds.

Customer: (pause) Really? Okay, that's... that's actually really helpful. I appreciate that.

Agent: Of course. And again, I'm removing that $49.99 charge, so that credit is going to show up on your next bill. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thank you.

Agent: Perfect. And Sarah, I do apologize that you didn't receive a clearer notification about the upgrade. We'll make sure to note on your account that you prefer to be contacted directly about any future changes. You should see both of those adjustments reflected on your next bill in about five to seven business days. Is there a good number to reach you if we need to follow up about anything?

Customer: No, you can just... the number on file is fine.

Agent: Great. Well, thank you for being a Frontier customer, and thank you for calling in today. We really appreciate your business.

Customer: Thank you. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
