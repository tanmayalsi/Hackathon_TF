Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged... I mean, I got my statement yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my internet bill went up like thirty bucks. What's going on?

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having billing concerns. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... hold on, let me find my bill. Um, it's 555-0847. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for service at 412 Maple Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Great, I have your account pulled up here. I can see your most recent bill from last month. So you mentioned a price increase and also a charge you don't recognize. Let's start with that unrecognized charge. Can you tell me which charge that is?

Customer: Yeah, on the current bill—so this would be the one I just got—there's a charge for $49.99 labeled as "Premium WiFi Installation" or something like that. I never ordered that. I don't even know what that is. I definitely didn't ask for anyone to come out and install anything.

Agent: Okay, I see that. (pause) Let me just... (typing sounds) Yeah, I'm looking at that charge right here. That $49.99 Premium WiFi Mesh System installation fee. Can you tell me if you received any communication from us before that charge was applied? An email, text, or voicemail?

Customer: No, nothing. That's the thing. If I had gotten something, I would've called right away. I mean, I'm looking at my emails and texts, and there's nothing from Frontier about this.

Agent: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for that. It looks like... (pause) hold on one second, let me pull up some notes here. (typing sounds) So I'm not seeing any work order or service call associated with that charge. It's possible this was added to your account in error. I can absolutely look into getting that reversed for you, but I do want to ask—do you currently have a mesh WiFi system set up at your home?

Customer: No, I don't. I just use the router that you guys gave me when I signed up. Works fine for what I need.

Agent: Okay, that's helpful. Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and remove that charge. That shouldn't be on your account. We'll credit that back, and you should see that reflected on your next bill or within one to two billing cycles.

Customer: Okay, thank you. But I still don't get how that even happened in the first place.

Agent: That's a fair question, and I'm not entirely certain from what I'm seeing here. It's possible there was a system error or... (trailing off) honestly, it could've been added by mistake. But regardless, we'll get it taken care of. Now, you also mentioned your monthly service charge went up. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, like I said, it went up almost thirty dollars. I've been with you guys for... I dunno, three years now? I've never had to pay this much. What am I paying for now that I wasn't before?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me look at your service plan history. So looking at your account, in the past three months... ah, I see. It looks like your plan was adjusted. You were on our Frontier Fiber 500 plan at $79.99 a month, and as of last month, it was changed to our Frontier Fiber 1 Gig plan at $109.99.

Customer: But... I didn't ask for that. Why would you just change my plan without asking me?

Agent: I understand your concern. Let me see if there's any documentation here about when that change was made. (pause, typing sounds) I'm looking at the notes, and it looks like there's a record showing the change was made on the 15th of last month. However, I'm not seeing any authorization note or... (pause) let me back up. Did you receive any communication before that change went into effect? Any letter, email, or call?

Customer: I mean, I might've gotten something, but like... if it was in an email, I probably missed it. You know how it is—you get so many emails. But the thing is, nobody called me or anything. If someone had actually called me and explained this, I would've said no. I was fine with what I had.

Agent: I totally understand. That's frustrating. So here's what I can tell you—sometimes what happens is we send out communications about rate adjustments or plan promotions, and depending on your area, there are periodic rate changes. But you're right that we should have been clearer about this, especially with a plan upgrade like that. The Fiber 1 Gig plan is a higher tier with faster speeds, but it sounds like that's not what you wanted.

Customer: No, it's not. I want to go back to the 500 plan or whatever it was. And honestly, I want a credit for the difference from last month since I didn't authorize this.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so I can definitely switch you back to the Fiber 500 plan. That'll bring your rate back down to $79.99. As for the credit for last month... (typing sounds) let me see what I can do here. Because technically, the plan upgrade did go through on our system, but I completely understand your position that you didn't authorize it. Give me just a second...

Customer: (background noise of papers shuffling) Yeah, I mean, this is really not okay. I've been a good customer, I pay on time, and then suddenly my bill jumps up like that?

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I appreciate your loyalty. (pause) Okay, so here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go ahead and process a credit to your account for the plan difference from last month. That's $30. So you'll get that $30 credit, and I'm switching you back to the Fiber 500 plan effective immediately. That way, going forward, you'll be back at the $79.99 rate.

Customer: Okay, well... that's better. I appreciate that. So let me just make sure I understand—the $49.99 charge is gone, the $30 credit is applied, and my bill goes back to what it was?

Agent: That's exactly right. You'll see both of those adjustments on your next statement. You should receive that within about a week and a half. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's... I think that covers it. But like, can you make a note or something on my account? So this doesn't happen again? I don't want to wake up next month and find out something else changed.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm adding a detailed note right now to your account indicating that you prefer to be contacted directly before any plan changes or service upgrades are applied. That way, if anything comes up in the future, my team will see that and make sure to reach out to you first. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. I really do apologize for the frustration with the billing issues today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for taking care of it.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier, and thank you for being a customer with us. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
