Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And who am I speaking with today?

Customer: This is Michael Chen.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, so I got my bill yesterday and... I mean, I've been with you guys for like three years now, and my bill just jumped up by thirty-five dollars. Thirty-five dollars, Derek. I want to know what's going on because nobody called me about any price increase.

Agent: (pause) I completely understand your frustration, Michael. Let me take a look at your account here and see what we've got going on. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing your current plan is our Fiber 500 package, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've had it the whole time.

Agent: Got it. And what was your previous bill amount?

Customer: It was 79.99 a month. I've been paying that for... I don't know, at least two years, probably longer. And now it's suddenly 114.99. Like, that doesn't make sense.

Agent: Okay, I see it here. (pause) So your promotional rate actually expired, Michael. It looks like you signed up for a promotional pricing that was set to run for 24 months, and that promotional period just ended. So you're now being moved to our regular rate for that tier of service.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. I never agreed to any promotional rate. I thought that was just the price of the service. Nobody ever told me it was going to go up.

Agent: I understand. Let me just... (typing sounds) Do you have your original service agreement handy? It should have been in the welcome packet you received when you first signed up.

Customer: No, I don't have that. That was three years ago, Derek. Why would I keep that? But I'm pretty sure they didn't say anything about it being temporary. I mean, the guy who sold it to me said it was a great rate.

Agent: Right, I hear you. Unfortunately, promotional rates do typically have an end date, and that information should have been disclosed at the time of signup. However, I want to help you out here. Let me see what options I have available. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I can offer you a loyalty discount. We have a program for long-standing customers. I could get you back down to... let me see here... $94.99 per month for the next 12 months.

Customer: Ninety-four ninety-nine? So I'm still paying fifteen dollars more than I was before?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. The loyalty discount brings it down from the 114.99, but the base rate has increased due to the expiration of your promotional period.

Customer: This is ridiculous. You know what? I've been nothing but a good customer. I pay on time, I don't cause problems, and this is how you treat me? I could go with cable from Comcast. They're advertising 79.99 for their gigabit service right now.

Agent: (pause) I completely understand your frustration, Michael. And I appreciate your loyalty over these three years. Let me see if I can do a little better for you. (typing sounds) Give me just one second here. (pause) Okay, so I can actually get supervisor approval to extend a promotional rate for you. I could offer you the Fiber 500 at $89.99 per month for the next 12 months. That would be pretty close to what you were paying before.

Customer: Okay... okay, that's better. But why couldn't you just offer me that in the first place instead of me having to call and complain?

Agent: That's a fair question. Generally, we do reach out to customers before promotional periods expire, but it sounds like that might not have happened in your case. I apologize for that. This loyalty offer I'm putting through right now will require supervisor override, so I do need to let you know that if you were to cancel service, you wouldn't be eligible for this rate again.

Customer: Okay, I get it. So you're locking me in.

Agent: Well, not locking you in exactly. You're still free to cancel anytime. But this promotional offer is specific to you as a gesture of our appreciation for your loyalty. Once you cancel, it wouldn't be available for reinstatement.

Customer: (pause) Fine. Okay. You said 89.99 for the next year?

Agent: Yes, sir. $89.99 per month for 12 months, and then your rate would adjust after that. But we can certainly revisit your options before that year is up. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm putting this through right now. And just to confirm, this will be effective with your next billing cycle, which would be... (pause) August 12th. So your next bill should reflect this rate.

Customer: And I'm going to get something in writing about this, right? Because I don't want any surprises next year.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to send an email to the address we have on file confirming this promotional rate adjustment. You should receive that within the next couple of hours. You'll also receive a notification when the rate change takes effect on your account.

Customer: Okay, what's the email address you're sending it to?

Agent: Let me check here. It shows [inaudible]@gmail.com. Is that still current?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I mean, I'm not happy about the increase at all, but I appreciate you bringing it down a bit. Hopefully, you guys will remember that next year instead of me having to fight about this again.

Agent: I understand completely, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Your loyalty is really important to us. If you have any issues or if you want to discuss your options before next year, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can always call back, and we'll take good care of you.

Customer: Alright. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you for choosing Frontier, Michael. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
