Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and there's a charge on here that doesn't make sense.

Agent: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. One second... All right, I've got your account here. It's under the name Michael Chen, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So you mentioned there's a charge you'd like to dispute. Can you tell me which charge is concerning you?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill jumped up. Last month I was paying $79.99 for my internet, and this month it's showing $94.99. That's... what, fifteen dollars more? And I didn't authorize any of that. I haven't added any services or anything.

Agent: I understand your concern, Mr. Chen. Let me take a look at what happened. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history here. It looks like you were on a promotional rate that expired at the end of last month. Your service has now moved to our standard pricing for the Fiber 200 plan.

Customer: Wait, what? What promotional rate? I've been paying the same amount for like... two years at least.

Agent: Let me check when that promotion started for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so your account shows that you enrolled in a promotional twelve-month rate back in... looks like January of last year. So that would have ended in January of this year.

Customer: But that was over a year ago. Why am I just now seeing the price increase? You're telling me you waited a full year after the promotion ended to charge me the regular price?

Agent: I apologize for the confusion, Mr. Chen. Let me look into this a bit further because you're right, that doesn't add up. (pause, typing sounds) Hmm, I'm seeing here that there was actually a service interruption on your account around... January. Let me see... (pause) It looks like there may have been a billing system error when your account was reacti—

Customer: (interrupting) So you're saying you made a mistake?

Agent: It appears there may have been a system issue, yes. I want to make sure I have all the details correct before I explain this. Can you hold for just one moment while I pull up more information? It'll just be about thirty seconds.

Customer: (sighing) Yeah, okay, I guess.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, then agent returns) Thank you for holding, Mr. Chen. So I spoke with my supervisor, and what happened is that when your account was reactivated after a brief service issue last month, the billing system didn't properly apply the continuation of your promotional rate. However, the promotion was set to expire in January, so the new rate would technically be accurate going forward.

Customer: But you just said the promotion ended over a year ago. How is it supposed to be continuing?

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion. Let me clarify. Your original twelve-month promotion did expire in January of this year, so technically, you should have been on the standard rate this whole time. However, our system didn't update your rate at that time, so you've been getting a courtesy extension, essentially. The rate increase you're seeing now is the first time the system has caught up to where your rate should actually be.

Customer: So you're saying... what? That I got a free year basically?

Agent: (pause) Well, that wasn't necessarily intentional. It was a system error on our end. However, I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. The thing is, when we do move customers to standard rates, we typically send out a notification letter about ninety days before the change takes effect. Can I ask if you received any correspondence from us about a rate change?

Customer: I mean... maybe? I get a lot of mail. But honestly, if you're charging me more, you should've called or emailed or something. I don't read every piece of paper that comes in.

Agent: That's completely fair. I apologize that we didn't reach out more proactively. What I can do is offer you a few options here. First, I can look into whether we have any current promotions available for your service level that could bring your rate down. Or, if you'd like, I can have a specialist contact you to discuss our other service packages, which might offer better value depending on your needs.

Customer: I don't want to switch plans or anything. I just want to know if you can bring my rate back down. What happened to loyalty pricing? I've been a customer for like four years.

Agent: (typing sounds) That's a great question, and I really appreciate your loyalty. Let me see what I can do. (pause) Okay, so we do have a current promotion running that I can apply to your account. It's a twelve-month rate at $84.99 per month for the Fiber 200 plan. That's not quite the $79.99 you were paying before, but it does reduce that $94.99 down by ten dollars. Would that work for you?

Customer: Hmm. So it's still a five-dollar increase from what I was paying. Can you do better than that?

Agent: Let me check with my supervisor one more time. (brief hold music) Mr. Chen, are you there?

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Okay, so my supervisor is able to authorize an additional one-time credit of $29.98 on your account to cover the overages from the past two months, and I can also lock in the $84.99 rate for the next fourteen months instead of twelve. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's... that's better. Yeah, I can work with that. But I do want to make sure this isn't going to happen again. Can you just let me know what my rate is going to be after these fourteen months are up?

Agent: Absolutely. After fourteen months, the rate would return to our then-current standard rate, but we can certainly reach out to you before that happens to discuss options. And I'm going to add a note to your account so that if there are any future promotions available, we'll make sure to contact you directly.

Customer: Okay. All right, that sounds fair. Thank you.

Agent: You're very welcome, Mr. Chen. So just to recap everything, you'll see a credit of $29.98 on your next bill, your rate will be $84.99 per month, and that's locked in for the next fourteen months. You'll receive an email confirmation of all these changes within the next twenty-four hours.

Customer: Perfect. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye!
