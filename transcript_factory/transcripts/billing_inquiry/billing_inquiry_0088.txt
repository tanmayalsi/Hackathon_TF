# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, so I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I don't know, something doesn't seem right. My internet bill jumped up like fifty bucks from last month.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. One second... Alright, I'm looking at your account for Sarah Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And you're saying your bill increased significantly this month? Let me take a look at your recent statements. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing your December bill was $49.99, and your January bill came through at... $99.99. Is that the increase you're referring to?

Customer: Exactly! That's exactly it. I don't understand why it doubled. I didn't add any services or anything. Did you guys just raise your rates or...?

Agent: Let me check here. (typing sounds) Looking at your account, I can see that you were enrolled in a promotional pricing plan that expired at the end of December. Your promotional rate was $49.99 per month for the first twelve months. That promotion has now ended, and you've been moved to our standard rate of $99.99 for the Frontier Fiber 500 Mbps plan.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. So you're telling me they buried that in the fine print? Nobody told me about this.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize for the lack of communication on our end. Looking at your account, I can see that we did send a notice approximately thirty days before the promotion ended. However, I understand that emails and notices can sometimes get missed or [inaudible]. 

Customer: Well, I never saw anything. I've been a customer for over a year now and paying $49.99 the whole time. Why wouldn't you just keep that rate? That seems kind of shady.

Agent: I hear you. The promotional pricing is designed for new customers, and unfortunately it does expire after the initial twelve-month period. However, let me see what options I can look into for you. (typing sounds) Can I ask... are you interested in potentially extending any service or bundling with other services? Sometimes we have retention options available.

Customer: I don't want to bundle anything. I just want the rate I was paying before. That was a fair price.

Agent: (pause) Absolutely. Let me see what I can do here. Unfortunately, I'm not able to manually override the rate on my end, but I can transfer you to our retention department. They actually have more flexibility when it comes to promotional adjustments for valued, long-term customers like yourself.

Customer: Okay, fine. Will I have to explain the whole situation again?

Agent: You know what, let me make a note here that you've been with us for over a year and you received the promotional increase notification... (typing sounds) Actually, I'm going to put a note on your account explaining your concern. When I transfer you, just let them know you'd like to discuss pricing options. They'll have access to everything we've discussed today.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. How long is this transfer going to take? I don't want to be on hold forever.

Agent: It should be pretty quick. The retention department is usually standing by, so you'll probably be connected within a couple of minutes. Let me just get you set up here... (pause) Okay, I'm transferring you now. Thanks for your patience, and I really appreciate you being a Frontier customer.

Customer: Thank you. I hope they can actually help me.

Agent: I have a good feeling about it. You take care, and thanks again for calling Frontier.
