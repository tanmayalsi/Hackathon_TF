Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually, I recognize it, but I'm being charged way more than I was before, and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having billing concerns. I'd be happy to help you out. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: Michael Chen.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, Michael. I've got your account pulled up here. I can see your bill from yesterday. Let me take a look at what might be different. Can you tell me which charge you're concerned about?

Customer: Yeah, so my internet plan. I've been paying like $79.99 a month for the last... I don't know, two years? And now this bill says it's $119.99. That's like a $40 increase. What is that about?

Agent: I understand your frustration, Michael. A $40 jump is definitely significant. Let me look into your account history here... (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you've been on our standard Gig Fiber plan at $79.99. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. I've been really happy with it. I don't know why they're changing the price on me.

Agent: Yeah, I hear you. So what I'm seeing in your account is that your promotional pricing expired. You were on an introductory rate for 24 months, and that period ended last month. So your plan has now moved to the standard pricing, which is $119.99 per month for that same Gig Fiber service.

Customer: Wait, wait. What? I was never told about this. I mean, I got the service and that was the price. Nobody said anything about it going up after two years.

Agent: (pause) I completely understand, and I apologize for the confusion. When you first signed up, there should have been information about the promotional period in your terms of service. Let me check your account notes... (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like you signed up online two years and three months ago. Did you receive any notices about this renewal?

Customer: I mean... maybe? I get a lot of emails. I don't know. I wasn't paying attention to it if I did. The point is, I've been a customer for over two years and now you're just jacking up my bill? That doesn't seem right.

Agent: You know what, Michael, I completely validate that concern. And I appreciate your loyalty as a customer for over two years. (pause) Let me see what options I can look at for you. Are you interested in maybe exploring a different plan, or would you like me to see if there's any current promotion I can apply to your account?

Customer: I don't know. I just want to know if I can keep the same price, or at least something closer to what I was paying. I was happy with that deal.

Agent: Let me pull up our current promotions... (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so here's what I can do for you. I can extend a promotional rate of $99.99 per month for an additional 12 months on your Gig Fiber plan. That's not quite the $79.99, but it would save you about $20 from the standard rate. How does that sound?

Customer: Hmm. It's still more than I was paying, though. Can't you just keep me at the original price?

Agent: (pause) I wish I could, Michael, but that pricing was specific to that initial promotion, and unfortunately it's no longer available for existing customers. The $99.99 is honestly the best I can offer right now. But after those 12 months, we can definitely revisit your account again, and there may be other options available at that time.

Customer: (sighing) I don't know. This is frustrating. Let me think about it. Is there anything else you can do?

Agent: (pause) You know what, let me check one more thing. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing that we do have a customer loyalty credit that I can apply. I can actually give you a one-time $40 credit to your account, which would essentially cover the difference for this month, and then your recurring charge would be $99.99 going forward. Would that help bridge the gap?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. That's something, at least. If you can do that, then I'll agree to the $99.99 rate.

Agent: Excellent. Thank you for working with me on this, Michael. I'm going to apply that $40 credit right now, and I'm also going to extend the promotional rate of $99.99 for the next 12 months. You should see that credit reflected on your next bill. (typing sounds) And... done. That's all set.

Customer: Okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate you finding something.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. I think we're good.

Agent: Perfect. Thanks again for calling Frontier Communications, and thank you for being a loyal customer, Michael. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
