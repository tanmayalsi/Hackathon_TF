Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my internet bill went up. I've been a customer for like, three years, and I've never had issues, but this doesn't look right.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into this. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. One moment... And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's Michael. Michael Brennan.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, Michael. I've got your account here. So you mentioned a charge you didn't recognize and a price increase? Let me take a look at your most recent bill here. (typing) What date was your bill from?

Customer: It came yesterday, so it would've been... I dunno, like the 15th or something? It's for service in March.

Agent: Got it. I'm looking at your March statement right now. I see your total is $129.99. Can you tell me which charge looks unfamiliar to you?

Customer: Yeah, so normally I pay... I think it's usually like $89 a month? But this time it's $129. That's like forty bucks more. And there's like a separate line item that says "Equipment Fee - WiFi Router" for $15 a month. I don't... I didn't sign up for any new equipment.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I see that. Let me look into what's going on here. (typing sounds) So the equipment fee—that's typically for a rented gateway or router. Do you remember if our techs installed any new equipment during your last service call, or did anything change recently with your setup?

Customer: No, nothing. I mean, I've had the same router for like, two years. It's just been sitting there working fine. I didn't ask for a new one.

Agent: (typing) Hmm, that's strange. Let me check your service history here. (pause) I'm not seeing any recent service appointments on your account. When was the last time a technician came out?

Customer: I... I'm not sure. It's been at least a year, maybe longer. I haven't had any problems.

Agent: Right. So this is a bit odd. The $15 monthly equipment fee shouldn't have been added without you requesting it. As for the price increase—can I ask, do you remember what speed tier you're currently on?

Customer: Um, I think it's the, uh... the 300 Meg? Or something like that?

Agent: Okay, and are you still on the promotional rate from when you signed up three years ago?

Customer: I guess? I mean, I don't know. My rate just stayed the same every month. I never heard anything about a promotion ending or whatever.

Agent: (pause, typing) That might be what happened here, actually. A lot of times, promotional rates do expire after 12 to 24 months, and then the rate adjusts to our regular pricing. Let me see what your original agreement was... (typing) Okay, I'm seeing you signed up in January of 2021 for a promotional rate of $89.99 a month for 24 months. That promotion would have ended in January of this year.

Customer: So... so you're telling me you guys just raised my rate without even telling me?

Agent: I understand that's frustrating, Michael. Typically, we do send notification letters about promotion expiration, but let me check if there's a note here about whether that was sent out. (pause, typing) I'm not seeing a documentation that it was sent. I apologize for that.

Customer: And what about this router fee? I don't even have a new router.

Agent: Yeah, that's something we need to look into. That shouldn't be on your account. Let me check... (typing) Could you do me a favor? Can you look at your modem or router and tell me if there's a Frontier label or sticker on it anywhere?

Customer: (pause) Uh, yeah, actually there is. I see it. "Frontier Gateway" on the sticker.

Agent: Okay, so that gateway is actually Frontier-owned equipment. Now, the thing is, typically we only charge a rental fee if you're on certain plan types or if you specifically requested managed WiFi services. Let me see what plan you're actually on... (pause, typing) Okay, I'm seeing here that you're on our standard Fiber 300 plan, which shouldn't include an equipment fee. That fee appears to have been added in error, or possibly during a system update.

Customer: So what does that mean? I shouldn't be paying it?

Agent: That's correct. That $15 a month charge should not be on your account. I'm going to remove that effective immediately. (typing) Done. That's removed as of your next billing cycle, and I'm going to credit your account for the $15 on this month's bill.

Customer: Okay, good. But what about the price increase? The regular charge going up?

Agent: (pause) So, that's a little different. When your promotional period ended in January, your rate did increase to our standard rate for that speed tier, which is currently $114.99 a month. I understand that's still higher than what you were paying before.

Customer: Yeah, by like $25 a month. That's... that's a lot.

Agent: I hear you. Let me see what options we have here. (typing sounds) Do you know if you've looked at our current promotions? We actually have some really competitive rates right now for existing customers.

Customer: No, I haven't looked at anything. What kind of promotions?

Agent: Well, I'm actually seeing we have a promotion running right now where I can lock in your rate at $99.99 a month for 12 months if you'd like to extend your service agreement by another year. That would save you about fifteen dollars a month compared to your current rate.

Customer: Only fifteen dollars? So it's still more than what I was paying before.

Agent: You're right, it is. But it is better than the $114.99, and it does give you a locked-in rate for a year so you're not subject to any increases during that time. (pause) I also want to mention that we did add that equipment fee in error, so when I credit that back to you, your bill this month will be $114.99 instead of $129.99.

Customer: Hmm. I mean, I appreciate you taking off the router fee, but I'm still frustrated about the price increase in general.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize that you weren't notified better about the promotion expiration. Can I ask—are you happy with the service itself? Internet speeds, reliability?

Customer: Yeah, actually. The internet's been great. No complaints there. It's just the price.

Agent: Okay, so that's good to know. You know what, because of the error with the equipment fee and the lack of notification on the promotion expiration, let me see what else I can do here. (typing) Okay, I'm going to apply a one-time courtesy credit of $25 to your account to help offset some of this increase. And I'll go ahead and enroll you in that 12-month promotional rate at $99.99, which locks you in and saves you money. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Really? You can do that?

Agent: I can, yes. I have the authority to make adjustments in situations like this where we've made errors on our end. So you're looking at $99.99 a month for the next 12 months, and you'll see the $25 credit applied to this bill, which will bring it down to $89.99 for March. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah. Yeah, that's... that's much better. I appreciate that.

Agent: Great. I'm glad I could help make this right. So just to confirm everything we've done today: I've removed the $15 equipment rental fee, applied a $25 one-time courtesy credit, and enrolled you in our promotional rate of $99.99 a month for the next 12 months. Your service will remain the same—Fiber 300 speeds. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. And I'll see all that reflected on my next bill?

Agent: Exactly. Your next bill should show everything correctly. You should receive it by the 15th of April. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Michael?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. And again, I apologize for the confusion with the rate increase. We appreciate your business over these past three years, and we hope to have you as a customer for many more. If you need anything else, just give us a call. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Thanks.

Agent: Take care, Michael. Bye.

Customer: Bye.
