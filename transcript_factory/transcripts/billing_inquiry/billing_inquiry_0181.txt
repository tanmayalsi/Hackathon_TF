Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just charged... I think there's been a mistake or something because my bill went up like thirty dollars this month and nobody told me about it.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'm sorry you're experiencing that. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. And what name is the account under?

Customer: Jennifer Walsh. W-A-L-S-H.

Agent: (typing sounds) Got it. Jennifer Walsh. Okay, I'm looking at your account now. I can see your most recent bill here. You're right—it does show an increase from your previous month. Let me see what we have going on here. (pause) It looks like you were on a promotional rate that expired at the end of last month.

Customer: What? I didn't know anything about a promotion expiring. I thought that was my regular rate. Like, I've been paying that for over a year now.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like you had a twelve-month promotional rate for our Fiber 300 plan at $59.99 per month, and that promotion ended on November 30th. As of December 1st, your plan adjusted to the standard rate of $89.99 per month.

Customer: That's... that's ridiculous. Nobody called me about this. I didn't get any email or anything. If I had known, I would have... I don't know, I would have done something about it.

Agent: Yeah, and I really do apologize for that. You should have definitely been notified beforehand. Let me check our notes here to see if there was any notification sent out. (pause) (typing sounds) I'm seeing that a notice was supposed to have been mailed to you about thirty days before the expiration, but I completely understand that sometimes those can get lost or overlooked. That's not an excuse, but I want to make sure we take care of this for you.

Customer: So what are my options here? Can I get the promotional rate back or something?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me see what we have available for you. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so the promotional pricing is typically for new customers or customers who haven't had a promotion in the last twelve months. However, I do have the ability to offer you our loyalty pricing, which would bring your rate down to $69.99 per month for your Fiber 300 plan. That's a significant savings from the $89.99 standard rate.

Customer: So I'd still be paying ten dollars more than what I was paying before?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. I wish I could do better than that, I really do. But this loyalty rate is actually our best available option for existing customers. Alternatively, we do have our Fiber 100 plan available at $49.99 per month if you'd be interested in a lower speed tier.

Customer: I don't want to downgrade my speed. I use the internet for work and I need the 300. (pause) Can I speak to a supervisor or something? Maybe they have more options?

Agent: Absolutely. I can get a supervisor on the line for you. They may have some additional options we can explore. Let me put you on a brief hold while I see if one is available. This should just take a moment.

Customer: Okay, fine.

Agent: (hold music plays for approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Thank you for holding, Jennifer. I've got my supervisor, Derek, here with me now. He's going to review your account as well.

Agent (Derek): Hi Jennifer, this is Derek, I'm a supervisor here at Frontier. I've got your account pulled up and I can see you've been a great customer for us, and I really do apologize that you weren't properly notified about the rate change. That's on us.

Customer: Thank you. So can you do anything about this?

Agent (Derek): Let me see what I can do. You know, while the standard options would be the loyalty rate at $69.99, I do have the ability to extend a one-time courtesy and honor the promotional rate for three additional months. So that would keep you at $59.99 through the end of February. That would give you some time to decide if you want to continue at the loyalty rate of $69.99 or if you'd like to explore other options.

Customer: (pause) Really? You can do that?

Agent (Derek): I can, yeah. I want to make this right for you. After those three months, the rate would move to our loyalty price of $69.99, but at least that gives you a little time to adjust and plan accordingly.

Customer: Okay, um, yeah. That actually... that does help quite a bit. I appreciate that. And you'll send me something this time, right? Like a notification that this is going to change again in three months?

Agent (Derek): Absolutely. I'm going to make a note on your account right now that you need to be contacted via email and phone at least thirty days before any rate change occurs. I'll personally make sure that happens. I'm also going to credit back the difference from this month—so that's the $30 difference between what you were charged and the promotional rate. That credit will show up on your next bill.

Customer: Oh wow. Okay, that's... thank you. I really appreciate that. I was pretty frustrated, but that does make it right.

Agent (Derek): I completely understand, and again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Jennifer?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for your help.

Agent (Derek): My pleasure. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business.

Customer: Bye.

Agent (Derek): Have a great day.
