Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm looking at it right now, and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I've been a customer for like three years, and I've never seen this before.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's... (rustling papers) ...555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. One moment, please. (pause) Alright, I have your account here. Your name is David Hernandez, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. And you mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize? Can you tell me a little more about what you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill is usually like... I don't know, around $89 a month, right? For the fiber internet package I have. But this month it's $127. There's a line item that just says "Service Adjustment Fee - $38." What is that?

Agent: (pause) Hmm, let me take a look at that. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing that charge here as well. Can you hold for just one moment while I check with our billing system to see what that adjustment was for?

Customer: Sure, I guess. But I mean, I haven't changed anything on my account, so I don't understand why there would be a fee.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Let me just pull up the details here. (brief hold music plays, then stops) Okay, I'm looking at your account history, and it looks like you were on a promotional rate when you first signed up three years ago. That promotion expired last month, and we transitioned you to our standard rate for that service tier.

Customer: What? Wait, you're telling me I was on a special price the whole time and nobody told me?

Agent: I apologize for the confusion. Typically when a promotional period ends, customers should receive notification about thirty days before the change takes effect. Let me check if that notification was sent out. (typing sounds) It looks like a notice was mailed to your address on file about... six weeks ago.

Customer: (frustrated) Well, I didn't get it. Or maybe I did and I didn't pay attention to it. But still, you could've called me or sent an email or something. That's a pretty big jump in price. That's like forty percent more.

Agent: You're right, and I appreciate your frustration. The price increase is significant, and I understand why that would be upsetting. Unfortunately, the promotional rate of $89 was time-limited, and the adjustment to $127 reflects our current standard pricing for the 500 Mbps fiber package you're subscribed to.

Customer: So you're just... raising my rates? Just like that?

Agent: I know this is frustrating. What I can do is look at what other options might be available to you. We do have some promotional offers running right now. Depending on your usage needs, there might be a different package that could work better for your budget. Or, I could potentially apply a retention credit to your account.

Customer: (pause) How much of a credit are we talking about here?

Agent: Let me see what I have available in the system. (typing sounds) For a valued customer like yourself with three years of account history, I could offer you a $15 monthly credit for the next twelve months. That would bring your bill down to about $112 a month.

Customer: That helps, but it's still like $23 more than what I was paying. And I don't know how long that credit lasts. What happens in a year?

Agent: That's a fair question. The credit would be applied for twelve months, and then your rate would go back to the standard $127 unless we have another promotion available at that time. Honestly, with how competitive the market is right now, there very well could be additional offers by then. But I can't promise what will be available next year.

Customer: (sighs) Yeah, okay. Look, I don't want to switch providers right now—I've been happy with the service. But this is really frustrating. I wish someone had been more clear about this.

Agent: I completely understand, and I genuinely apologize that the communication wasn't as clear as it should have been. I'm going to make a note on your account about this call, and I'm going to go ahead and apply that $15 monthly credit for you, effective immediately. That will show up on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. So my next bill should be...?

Agent: Right, so instead of $127, you should see around $112. And that'll be the case for the next twelve months with that credit applied. You'll receive a confirmation of the credit in writing, either by email or mail, depending on your preference.

Customer: Email is fine.

Agent: Perfect. I'm going to update that right now. (typing sounds) Done. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm still not thrilled about it, but I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: I really do appreciate your patience and for being a loyal Frontier customer. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're available twenty-four seven.

Customer: Alright, thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day, David.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
