Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Or actually, I do recognize it, but it shouldn't be there.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... Alright, I'm showing an account under the name David Chen. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So you mentioned there's a charge you'd like to dispute. Can you tell me which charge that is?

Customer: Yeah, so my bill this month is $89.99, but last month it was $59.99. That's a thirty dollar increase, and I never agreed to any of that. I've been a customer for like... three years now, and my rate's always been the same. What's going on?

Agent: I understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. Let me look into that for you. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing here that your account was on a promotional rate that expired on the first of this month. You were on our introductory Gig Fiber plan at $59.99 per month for the first year.

Customer: Wait, what? I never agreed to any introductory rate. I thought that was my regular rate.

Agent: I apologize for the confusion. When you signed up three years ago, you would have received documentation outlining the promotional period. However, I can see how that might not have been clear. Let me explain what happened. Your promotional rate was for twelve months from your installation date, which was approximately... (typing sounds) ...March 15th of three years ago. After that twelve-month period ended, your account should have transitioned to our standard rate.

Customer: Okay, but that doesn't make sense because my bill hasn't changed in three years. So either you guys never charged me the standard rate, or something else is going on.

Agent: That's actually a great question, and I appreciate you pointing that out. Let me look at your full billing history. (pause, typing sounds) Oh, I see what happened here. It looks like there was a manual credit applied to your account back then—it appears to have been a courtesy extension of the promotional rate for an additional two years. But that credit is now expiring.

Customer: (pause) So you're telling me that someone at Frontier gave me a two-year extension, and now you're just... taking it away without telling me?

Agent: I completely understand why you'd be upset about that. The credit was applied, but it looks like you weren't notified when it was set to expire. That's on us, and I apologize for that. However, I do want to explain what the $89.99 rate includes now. You're actually getting an upgraded service tier—you've been bumped up to our Gig Fiber Plus package, which includes faster speeds, 500 channels of TV, and premium support.

Customer: I don't want premium support or TV channels. I just use the internet. Can't I go back to the regular fiber plan?

Agent: Absolutely, we can make that change for you. Let me look at our current pricing... (typing sounds) Okay, so our standard Gig Fiber plan without the TV package is currently $74.99 per month.

Customer: That's still a fifteen dollar increase from what I was paying.

Agent: Right, and I hear you. The thing is, the promotional rate you were on—that $59.99—that was specifically a limited-time introductory offer. Standard rates have also gone up slightly over the past couple of years due to... well, infrastructure costs and demand in your area. But here's what I can do. I can speak with my supervisor about applying a courtesy credit to your account to bring you back down to $59.99 for an additional twelve months. Would that be helpful?

Customer: (pause) How much of a credit are we talking about

Agent: It would be $15 per month for the next twelve months, so that would bring your rate back to $59.99. After that twelve-month period, you would be back to the standard rate of $74.99, and we would notify you at least thirty days in advance before that happens.

Customer: Okay... and you can actually do that? You're not just going to say yes and then my bill still shows $89.99?

Agent: (slight laugh) No, I promise that won't happen. I'm going to note this on your account right now. Let me just confirm—you want me to downgrade you from the Gig Fiber Plus package to the standard Gig Fiber plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, please.

Agent: And you'd like the courtesy promotional rate of $59.99 for the next twelve months?

Customer: Yes.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm processing that change now. You should see the change reflected on your next billing cycle, which would be next month. Your bill will show $59.99, and there should also be a credit applied to your current bill for the overage. So you'll get credited back for this month's difference.

Customer: Okay, that's good. So when exactly will I see that credit?

Agent: The credit should post to your account within one to two billing cycles. You'll see a line item on your bill labeled "Courtesy Adjustment" or something similar. And just to reiterate, you'll receive a notification from us about ninety days before that rate goes back up to $74.99.

Customer: Alright, well, I appreciate you working with me on this. I was pretty frustrated when I called in.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you had to deal with that confusion. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks.

Agent: You're welcome, Mr. Chen. Thank you for being a valued Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
