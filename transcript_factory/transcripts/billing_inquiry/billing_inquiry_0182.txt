Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I noticed my internet bill went up like thirty dollars. I've been a customer for three years and nobody told me about this increase.

Agent: I appreciate you calling in. I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated about that. Let me pull up your account real quick so I can take a look at what happened. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, just give me one second here... and I've got you pulled up. I'm showing the account for Sarah Mitchell at 428 Ashton Drive, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So I can see your January bill was $79.99, and now in February it's showing $109.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. Thirty dollars more. That's almost forty percent. I mean, I've never had any issues with my service and I'm a good customer. Why would they just raise my price like that without any notice?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. (pause) So what I'm seeing here is that your promotional rate expired. You were on an introductory offer for the first two years—that was our Fiber Gig plan at $79.99 per month. That promotion ended with your January billing cycle, so your rate went to the regular price of $109.99, which is what we're charging new customers right now for that same service level.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me I have to pay more just because my promotion ended? I didn't agree to that. When I signed up, nobody said anything about a price increase after two years.

Agent: I understand that's frustrating. These promotions are typically limited-time offers, and that information would have been in your service agreement when you initially signed up. However, let me see what options I might have available for you. (typing sounds) Can you hold for just one moment while I check our current retention offers?

Customer: (sighing) Yeah, I guess.

Agent: (brief hold music, then returns) Thanks for holding. So I do have some good news. Because you've been such a loyal customer and you haven't had any service issues, I can offer you a new rate of $89.99 per month for the next twelve months. That would bring your bill down from the $109.99 we just charged you.

Customer: So it's still more than what I was paying before, but less than what it jumped to?

Agent: That's correct, yes. It's a compromise between the promotional rate you were on and our standard rate. I wish I could get you back to the original $79.99, but unfortunately that promotion has expired and I don't have the ability to reinstate it.

Customer: Hmm. (pause) Well, I mean... I guess that's better than paying a hundred and ten. But this whole thing just feels like a bait and switch, you know? They hook you in with a good price and then raise it after a couple years.

Agent: I hear you, and I do apologize that the transition wasn't clearer. I know it can feel like a surprise when a promotional rate ends. The twelve-month offer I'm providing should help offset some of that increase, and then we can certainly discuss options again when that period is coming to an end.

Customer: Okay, fine. I'll take the $89.99 rate. But I want to make sure—there's no other surprises coming, right? Like after twelve months it won't just jump up again without me knowing?

Agent: So after this twelve-month period ends, your rate would go back to our standard pricing unless we have another promotion available at that time or if you want to look at other plan options. But I would strongly recommend calling us about thirty days before this offer expires so we can look at what's available to you then. We can absolutely make sure you're not caught off guard.

Customer: Alright. And you'll send me something in writing confirming this rate change?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to send you an email confirmation right now with all the details of this new rate and the terms—so you'll have it for your records. You should receive that within the next few minutes. And the rate will be effective on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and I apologize again for the confusion around the rate change. If you have any issues with your service, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
