Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize. It's like... it jumped up pretty significantly and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... and just to verify, is this for the account under the name Jennifer Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And just so I have the right bill, what's the date on the statement you're looking at?

Customer: It came yesterday, so it should be for... March 1st through March 31st.

Agent: Got it. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking at your March statement here. I can see your previous bill was $89.99 and your current bill is $127.50. Is that the increase you're calling about?

Customer: Yes! Exactly. That's almost forty dollars more. I don't understand why it went up that much. I haven't added any services or anything. What changed?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me look at the details here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing... it looks like your promotional rate expired on March 1st. You were on our 12-month promotion for fiber internet, and that ended. So you've moved to our standard pricing for that service.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about that. How is that allowed? I mean, I've been a customer for over three years and now you're just going to jump my bill up like this?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Jennifer. You know, typically when a promotional rate is ending, we do send out notices... let me see here... (typing sounds) it looks like a notice was mailed about 30 days prior to the expiration. Did you happen to receive something in the mail around the beginning of February?

Customer: I... maybe? I get so much mail, I don't really... I mean, I might have thrown it away without reading it. But still, that seems kind of sneaky. Like, why would you set it up so it just automatically goes up?

Agent: I hear you. It does feel like a surprise when the price changes, especially that much. And I appreciate your loyalty as a long-time customer. Let me see what options we might have here. (pause) What I can do is... let me check if we have any current promotions that might apply to your account.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that would be good.

Agent: (typing sounds, longer pause) Alright, so looking at what we have available right now, I can offer you a six-month promotional rate on your fiber internet service that would bring your monthly bill down to $99.99 instead of the $127.50. So you'd save about $28 a month for the next six months.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so that's still higher than what I was paying before, though.

Agent: That's true, it is. The service itself has upgraded since your original promotion—we've actually increased the speeds on that tier. So the base service is a bit more valuable now than it was when you signed up originally. But yes, the promotional rate structure has changed.

Customer: Hmm. So when this six-month thing ends, am I going to get hit with another big increase?

Agent: That's a fair question. So at the end of the six months, we'll send you notices about what your options are at that time. We might have different promotions available, or you're always welcome to call and see what we can work out. We do try to keep our longtime customers' rates competitive.

Customer: (sighs) I guess I don't really have much of a choice, do I?

Agent: Well, I want you to know that you do have options. If you wanted to look at other providers, you certainly could. But I'd hate to see you go, and I think our fiber service is really solid. Plus, we have that no-contract option, so you're not locked in. The promotional rate I mentioned, that's something I can add to your account right now if you'd like.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Let's do the six-month thing. But can you make a note on my account that I want to hear about promotions coming up? Like, maybe a call or something?

Agent: Absolutely. I can definitely make a note here. (typing sounds) I'm putting in that you prefer to be proactively notified about upcoming rate changes and promotions. We can add a flag to reach out to you about 60 days before your next promotional period ends, how's that?

Customer: Yes, that would be really helpful, actually.

Agent: Great. So here's what I'm doing. I'm going to apply the six-month promotional rate of $99.99 per month starting with your next billing cycle on April 1st. You should see that reflected on your April bill. I'm also adding the service note, and I'm going to send you an email confirmation of this change.

Customer: Okay, thanks. And just to confirm, my internet speed isn't going to change or anything?

Agent: Nope, your service level stays exactly the same. You're on our Frontier Fiber 500 service, and you'll continue to get those speeds. This is just the rate adjustment.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate it. I'm sorry for being a bit cranky about it.

Agent: (chuckles) Oh, please don't apologize. Your reaction is completely valid and honestly, it's feedback I hear fairly often. We understand that bill increases are never fun, and I'm glad we could find a solution that works better for you going forward.

Customer: Thank you. I do really like the service, so I'm glad to stay.

Agent: That's great to hear. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Well, I really appreciate you calling in, Jennifer, and I'm sorry for the frustration with the billing. Your confirmation email should be in your inbox within the next couple of minutes. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks again.

Agent: Thank you, bye!

Customer: Bye.
