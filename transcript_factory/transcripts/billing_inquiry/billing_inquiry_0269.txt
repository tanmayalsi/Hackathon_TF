Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. And also, I think my internet bill went up?

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account real quick. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the address on Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. Okay, I'm looking at your account now. So you mentioned a charge you don't recognize and a price increase. Let me start there. What's the charge that's standing out to you?

Customer: Well, there's like a $15 charge that says "Equipment Upgrade Fee" and... I don't know, I didn't ask for any upgrades. And then my bill went from like $79.99 to $94.99. That's almost fifteen bucks more a month. What's going on with that?

Agent: Okay, I see both of those items on here. Let me explain what's happening. (pause) So the equipment upgrade fee—that's actually from about three weeks ago when our tech team came out to your address. Are you recalling that service visit at all?

Customer: Oh, yeah, actually, um... they came out because my internet was being really slow. But they said they were just checking the lines or something. They didn't tell me there was gonna be a charge for that.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me look at the notes here. (typing sounds) Okay, so the tech did upgrade your modem to a newer model that's compatible with our updated network infrastructure. That would explain the upgrade fee. However, I will say that fee should have been explained to you before the work was done.

Customer: So I'm stuck with that charge? I didn't even agree to it.

Agent: Well, let me see what I can do. (pause) Actually, looking at your service history, I can see that this upgrade was necessary for your line to maintain proper speeds. But you're right that communication could've been better. I'm going to go ahead and remove that $15 fee for you as a courtesy this time, okay?

Customer: Oh, okay. Well, that's... that's helpful. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. Now, regarding the price increase to your monthly bill—that's actually from a rate adjustment that went into effect last month. You should have received a notice about that in the mail about 30 days prior.

Customer: I didn't get anything.

Agent: Okay, um... (pause) Sometimes those do get missed. But basically, we adjusted rates across our service area. It looks like your plan went from our standard fiber package at $79.99 to $89.99. That's about a ten dollar increase. Then we also added a $4.99 modem rental fee to your bill because of the equipment upgrade I mentioned.

Customer: Wait, modem rental? I thought... I mean, the tech guy just upgraded the modem. Now I'm paying to rent it?

Agent: (pause) I understand the confusion there. So with the new modem, it does come with a monthly rental fee since it's company-owned equipment. Previously, your older equipment didn't have that associated charge. I realize this is a lot hitting your bill at once.

Customer: This is frustrating. So I'm going from like eighty bucks to ninety-five bucks just because you guys updated my equipment and raised your rates?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I hear you. You've actually been a customer with us for quite a while now, right? Let me see what I can offer you. (typing sounds) What if I apply a $5 monthly credit to your account for the next six months? That would bring your bill down to $89.99 for the next half year, which is closer to what you were paying before. Would that help?

Customer: (pause) I mean... that's better than nothing, I guess. But ideally, I wouldn't want the modem fee at all.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, the modem rental fee is standard with the new equipment, but the credit I'm offering will definitely offset most of that. And we do have promotional pricing if you're interested in trying our higher-tier package, but that would actually bring your price up more, so I wouldn't recommend it.

Customer: No, no. I just want what I had before.

Agent: Understandable. So here's what I've done: I've removed the $15 equipment upgrade fee, and I'm going to apply a $5 monthly credit for six months. That brings your bill to $89.99 instead of the $94.99. It's not quite back to $79.99, but the rate increase is unfortunately staying in effect for all customers in your area.

Customer: Okay, fine. I appreciate you taking off the upgrade fee, at least.

Agent: Absolutely. I really do apologize for the lack of communication on the tech's part. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. When will the credit show up?

Agent: (typing sounds) The credit will appear on your next billing cycle, which looks like it'll be in about 12 days. You should see the adjustment on your next statement.

Customer: Alright. Thank you.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for choosing Frontier Communications, and thanks for being a customer with us. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
