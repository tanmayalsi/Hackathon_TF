Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and there's a charge that... it doesn't make sense.

Agent: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. That's my service address phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. And just to confirm, is this for the account under the name Michael Torres?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Michael. I've got your account here. So you mentioned there's a charge you'd like to dispute. Can you tell me what's concerning you?

Customer: Well, yeah. So I've been a customer for... I don't know, like three years now? And my bill was always $79.99 for the gig fiber package. This month it jumped to $99.99. That's twenty bucks more. And I didn't authorize any upgrade or anything, so I'm not sure what happened.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Michael. Let me take a look at what's going on with your account. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you were on a promotional rate that expired at the end of last month. That twelve-month promotion ended, so your rate adjusted to the standard pricing for the gigabit fiber plan in your area.

Customer: Wait, a promotional rate? I don't... I mean, nobody told me it was going to expire. And I definitely don't remember signing up for a promotion.

Agent: I completely understand. These promotional periods can be easy to forget about. Let me pull up some details here. (typing sounds) So according to our records, you activated service on March 15th of two years ago, and you were automatically enrolled in a twelve-month promotional rate at that time. The promotion was set to expire on March 15th of this year, which would have been about a month ago now.

Customer: But that's the thing—I never got any notification. You guys should've sent me something saying, "Hey, your rate is about to go up." That's just... that's not fair.

Agent: You know what, Michael? That's actually a really valid point. Let me check our communication logs to see if a notification was sent. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like a notification was sent via email on February 28th, and we also attempted an outbound call on March 10th to notify you about the rate change.

Customer: I... okay, I might have missed the email. I get a lot of emails. But I definitely didn't get a call about this. I would remember that.

Agent: (pause) I apologize if you didn't receive that call. Sometimes those can go to voicemail or get missed. But I do want to help make this right. What I can do is look at potentially extending your promotional rate or finding you an alternative plan that might work better for your needs. Let me see what options are available for a valued customer like yourself.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, I... I'd appreciate that. I mean, I like the service, it's been great. I just wasn't expecting the price to jump like that without more of a heads up.

Agent: I totally get it. (typing sounds) Alright, so here's what I'm seeing. I can't reapply the exact same promotional rate, but what I can do is offer you a new twelve-month promotional rate at $84.99 per month for the gig fiber service. That's still an increase from your previous $79.99, but it's less than the standard $99.99 rate.

Customer: Hmm, so it's still going up though. Can't you just keep it at $79.99?

Agent: I wish I could, Michael. The $79.99 was really our entry-level promotional pricing, and unfortunately our system won't let me manually override that once the promotion has expired. But I can tell you that $84.99 is the best rate I can offer you right now for the twelve-month period. After that twelve months, we can revisit your options again.

Customer: (sighs) That's... I mean, it's not ideal, but it's better than the full $99.99, I guess. What about the charge on this month's bill though? Am I going to get credited for the difference, or am I just stuck paying $99.99 this time?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me go ahead and apply a one-time courtesy credit to your account to cover the overage difference between what you were paying before and what the standard rate is. So for this billing cycle, I can credit you $20 to help offset that jump. How does that sound?

Customer: Okay, well... yeah, I mean, that helps. And the new rate of $84.99 starts next month?

Agent: Actually, I want to make sure we get you set up correctly. Let me go ahead and apply this promotional rate effective immediately. So your next bill should reflect $84.99, plus the $20 credit I'm applying. That means your next statement should show around... let me calculate that... roughly $64.99 before taxes.

Customer: Oh! Okay, so the credit will show on the next bill?

Agent: Exactly. You'll see the $20 credit applied, and then the new promotional rate will kick in. And just to be clear, this new rate is locked in for twelve months from today. After that, we'll reach out to you before anything changes again.

Customer: (pause) Alright, that's... that's actually pretty reasonable. I appreciate you working with me on this. I just wish it hadn't been so confusing in the first place.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm sorry you had that frustration with the rate change. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you regarding your bill or your service today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for handling that, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael. I've got everything set up on my end. You should see those changes reflected on your next bill, which would arrive around the 15th of next month. If you have any questions or run into any issues, feel free to give us a call back anytime. We really appreciate your business with Frontier.

Customer: Thanks. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!
