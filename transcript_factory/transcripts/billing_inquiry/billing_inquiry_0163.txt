Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's like a $25 charge on there that I don't recognize. I've been with you guys for about three years and I want to know what this is for.

Agent: I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment while I pull that up here... Alright, I've got your account. I see you're at... 2847 Maple Street in Springfield?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. So you're seeing a charge that wasn't there before. Can you tell me approximately when this charge appeared on your bill?

Customer: It's on this month's bill, which I just got a couple days ago. And like I said, I've never seen this before. I'm paying... I think it's normally like $79.99 a month and now it's saying $104.99, so something's definitely off.

Agent: I understand your concern. Let me take a closer look at your account here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you have our Frontier Fiber 500 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's what I've always had.

Agent: Right, and your rate was locked in at $79.99 a month. However, I'm seeing here that your promotional rate has ended. You were on our new customer promotion, which was a twelve-month offer. That promotion expired as of this billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, what? I was never told about this. I mean, nobody called me or sent me anything saying my rate was going to go up. That's... I don't think that's fair.

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from. Let me just verify when that promotion started. (typing sounds) So it looks like it was activated on March 15th of last year, which means it would've ended on March 15th of this year. You should have received... (pause) ...let me see here. According to our records, we sent you a notification email about sixty days before the expiration.

Customer: I don't remember getting an email like that. I mean, I get a lot of emails, but I feel like I would've remembered something about my bill going up by twenty-five dollars.

Agent: I hear you. Unfortunately, the promotional period is something that customers do agree to when they sign up for service. But let me see what I can do to help you out here. (pause) One moment. (brief hold music) ...Okay, I'm back. So I'm looking at what options we have available. Given that you've been a loyal customer for three years, I might be able to apply a courtesy credit or perhaps get you into a different promotional offer.

Customer: Okay, I'm listening.

Agent: So here's what I can do. I can offer you a six-month rate reduction back down to $89.99 a month. That's not quite the original $79.99, but it's splitting the difference for you. Or, if you're interested, I could move you to our new Fiber 300 plan, which would be $69.99 a month for the first year, though your speeds would be a bit lower.

Customer: I don't want to downgrade my speeds. I use the internet for work and I need the 500. But what about just... can't you match what I was paying before?

Agent: (pause) Let me be honest with you. I can't quite get you back to the exact $79.99 because that was part of the promotional pricing structure. But I'll tell you what—let me talk to my supervisor and see if there's something else we can do. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Sure, okay.

Agent: (hold music plays for approximately 45 seconds) Thank you for holding. Alright, so I spoke with my supervisor, and what we can do is we can offer you $84.99 a month for the Fiber 500 plan for the next twelve months. That's the best I can do, but I think that's a much better option than the $104.99. How does that sound?

Customer: ...Okay, yeah. That's better than jumping up by twenty-five bucks. I mean, it's still more than I was paying, but at least it's not as bad. Can you make sure I get something in writing about this, though? So I know when this rate expires and what happens next time?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to send you a confirmation email at [inaudible]@gmail.com—is that the right email on file?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And the confirmation will include your new rate of $84.99, the start date, and the expiration date of this offer, which would be twelve months from now. It'll also include instructions on what to expect after that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your loyalty. If you need anything else, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
