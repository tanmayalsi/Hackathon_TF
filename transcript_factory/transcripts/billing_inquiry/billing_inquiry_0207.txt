Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um... I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and my internet service just went up like thirty dollars. I've been a customer for almost five years and nobody told me about any price increase.

Agent: I understand, and I appreciate you bringing that to our attention. Let me pull up your account here. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. I'm looking at your account for... Sarah Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So Sarah, I'm seeing here that your bill did increase. Let me look at what happened. (pause) Okay, so it looks like you were on our Internet 200 plan at $89.99 a month, and that plan has been adjusted to $119.99. Can you tell me a little bit more about what you're concerned with regarding this increase?

Customer: What do you mean "adjusted"? I didn't agree to any adjustment. I got a promotional rate when I first signed up and I've been paying that for years. Nobody called me, nobody sent me anything. I just see this on my bill.

Agent: You know, I completely understand your frustration. Let me see here... (typing sounds) Looking back at your account, I do see some notes. It looks like we did send out a notification about this. Let me check the mail date on that. It was sent... looks like May 15th. Did you happen to receive anything from us in mid-May?

Customer: I mean, maybe? I get so much junk mail. But I shouldn't have to hunt through my mail for something like this. I'm a loyal customer. I've been paying on time every single month. Why would you just raise my bill without calling me?

Agent: And I hear you, Sarah. I really do. Typically what happens is we do send out written notification when introductory rates expire, and the Internet 200 plan's promotional pricing was set to end after 24 months of service. (pause) Looking at your account, it appears that period ended in April, so the rate change would have gone into effect in May.

Customer: So what, you just wait for the promotional period to end and then jack up the price? That's not customer service, Derek. I should've been contacted directly. A letter in the mail is not good enough for something this important.

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate your loyalty. Let me see what I can do for you here. (typing sounds) Um, so unfortunately I'm not able to reverse the charge that's already been applied to your account, but what I can do is I can offer you a different plan. We do have some options available right now.

Customer: I don't want to switch plans. I want my bill back to what it was. That's fair, right? I mean, I've been a good customer.

Agent: Sarah, I absolutely understand that, and I wish I could do that for you. The thing is, the promotional rate has expired, and the regular pricing for the Internet 200 plan is the $119.99. However, what I'm authorized to do is offer you a credit for this billing cycle and then see if we have any current promotions that might help bring that monthly cost down for you going forward.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay. What kind of credit?

Agent: Let me look at what I have available. (typing sounds) Alright, so I can apply a one-time credit of $30 to your account. That would bring this month's bill closer to what you were paying before. As for going forward, we do have a promotion right now for our Internet 300 plan, which would actually be $99.99 for the first year. That would save you $20 a month compared to what you're paying now.

Customer: Wait, so you're offering me a faster plan for less money? Why wouldn't that have been offered to me instead of just raising my price?

Agent: That's a fair question, and I understand the frustration there. This promotion just launched recently, so it wasn't available during your previous billing cycle. But I think it could be a good option for you. You'd get faster speeds and actually pay less than you're currently paying.

Customer: And then after a year?

Agent: After the year is up, it would go to regular pricing for the Internet 300 plan, which would be $129.99 a month.

Customer: (pause) Hmm. So I'm still paying more than I was originally.

Agent: Right now, yes, that's true. But you would have a full year at the promotional rate. And I have to be honest with you, Sarah—internet pricing has increased industry-wide. We're actually quite competitive in the market. But I do want to make sure you feel valued as a customer. Let me see if there's anything else I can offer here.

(pause) (typing sounds)

Customer: What do you mean?

Agent: I'm just checking... I might be able to add a three-month extension on that promotional rate. So instead of the promotion running for just one year, it could run for 15 months. Let me just verify that I can do that. (pause) Yes, actually, I can apply that for you. So you'd get the Internet 300 at $99.99 for 15 months, and then it goes to regular pricing. Plus the $30 credit on this bill.

Customer: (pause) ...Okay. Yeah, that sounds... I mean, that's better. I appreciate that. But I have to say, I really think you should reach out to customers before raising their rates like this. It's not right.

Agent: You know, Sarah, I hear you loud and clear, and I've made a note on your account about this feedback. I'm going to flag it for our retention team as well, because your loyalty does matter to us, and I don't want to see good customers get frustrated. Your feedback is valuable.

Customer: Alright. Thank you. So just to confirm—what exactly are you doing?

Agent: Perfect. So here's what I'm putting in place for you right now: First, I'm applying a $30 credit to your current bill. Second, I'm switching you to the Internet 300 plan at $99.99 a month for the first 15 months. After that, it moves to $129.99. The switch will take effect on your next billing cycle, which starts on the 23rd of this month. Does that sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that works. And the faster speeds—what is that exactly?

Agent: Great question. You'll go from the Internet 200 plan, which is 200 megabits per second, to the Internet 300 plan, which is 300 megabits per second. So you'll see a noticeable improvement in speed, especially if you have multiple devices on your network or you're doing things like streaming or video calls.

Customer: Okay, that's nice. Will there be any downtime when you switch it over?

Agent: There shouldn't be any downtime on your end. It's all done remotely from our system. You might want to restart your modem once just to be safe, but it should transition seamlessly.

Customer: Alright, Derek. I appreciate your help with this. I'm still not thrilled about how this was handled, but I'm satisfied with what you've done.

Agent: I really appreciate you saying that, Sarah, and I'm glad we could work something out together. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything.

Agent: Excellent. Well, thank you so much for being a loyal Frontier customer, and I do apologize again for the frustration with the rate increase. If you have any issues with the speed or anything else going forward, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can always call us back, or you can manage your account through our website.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Have a great day, Sarah.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
