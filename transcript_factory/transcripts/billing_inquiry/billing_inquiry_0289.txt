# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I was charged... I think there's an error? Or maybe my rate went up? I'm not really sure, but it's more than it usually is.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my landline number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here. One moment... Okay, I'm looking at the account for Sarah Chen, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Sarah. I can see your account here. So you're saying your bill is higher than usual? What amount were you expecting versus what you were charged?

Customer: Well, I've been paying... I think it's been around $79 a month for the last year or so? And this month they're charging me $99. That's a $20 difference. That's... that's pretty significant, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. A $20 jump would definitely catch anyone's attention. Let me look at your billing history here... (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate actually expired this month. It looks like you've been on a 12-month promotional offer at $79.99, and that ended with your March billing cycle.

Customer: Oh... so my rate is just going up automatically? I didn't see anything about that. Did you guys send me something?

Agent: That's a good question. Let me check... (typing sounds) I do see that we sent out a notification letter approximately 30 days before the end of your promotional period. It should have arrived around mid-February. Did you happen to receive anything like that?

Customer: I... I get so much mail. I might have thought it was junk? I'm not really sure. But I mean, shouldn't you guys call or email or something? I've been a customer for years.

Agent: You know, I really hear you on that, and I appreciate your loyalty. A lot of customers do prefer email notifications. That's actually feedback we get pretty regularly. The letter we sent is our standard notification, but I can definitely see how that might get missed. (pause) So just to walk you through what happened—your new rate is $99.99 per month for your current plan, which is our standard Fiber 300 internet package.

Customer: Is there anything I can do about it? Like... can you put me back on the promotional rate? Or is there a different plan I could switch to that would be cheaper?

Agent: (typing sounds) That's a fair question. Unfortunately, I'm not able to reinstate the promotional rate once it's expired, but let me see what options we have available to you right now... (pause) Okay, so I do have a couple of things. First, we do have a retention offer I can apply to your account. It's a six-month rate guarantee at $84.99 per month for the same 300 Mbps service. After that, it would go back to the standard rate of $99.99.

Customer: So it's just delaying the problem for six months?

Agent: I understand that perspective, and you're not wrong. However, it does save you $15 a month for the next six months, which is $90 in savings. And honestly, in six months, we might have different promotional offers available, so at that point you could potentially get back on a new promotion. But I won't promise that, of course.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, well... what about switching to a different plan? Do you have anything cheaper?

Agent: Let me pull up our current plans... (typing sounds) So we have our Fiber 100 plan at $59.99 per month, which is our entry-level option. That gives you 100 Mbps download speeds. Then there's Fiber 200 at $74.99, which is 200 Mbps. And then your current one is Fiber 300 at $99.99.

Customer: What's the difference between 100 and 200? Like, would I even notice?

Agent: That's a really good question. It depends on what you use your internet for. The 100 Mbps plan is great for basic browsing, email, watching streaming video on one or two devices. The 200 Mbps is better if you're doing things like video conferencing, multiple people streaming at once, or if you work from home and do uploads and downloads. What does your typical usage look like?

Customer: I work from home, actually. I do a lot of video calls—like, probably four or five a day. And I have two kids who are always streaming stuff or doing online schoolwork. So... I probably need something decent.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so honestly, for that kind of usage, I'd probably recommend staying at the 300 level or at least the 200. The 100 might get a little tight, especially when multiple people are using it at the same time. With video calls, you really want that bandwidth.

Customer: So basically, I'm stuck either paying $99 or going down to a plan that won't work for me?

Agent: I hear the frustration, and I'm sorry you're in this situation. But here's what I can do—I can apply that retention offer I mentioned, the $84.99 rate, and I can also add a courtesy credit to your account for this month as a gesture of goodwill. Let me put in... a $20 credit. That would bring your current bill down to $79.99 just for this month, and then starting next month, it'll be $84.99 for the next six months.

Customer: (pause) Really? You can do that?

Agent: Yes, I can. And look, I want to be transparent with you—I can tell you've been a loyal customer, and I do want to make this right. The credit is a one-time thing, but the $84.99 rate is locked in for six months. Does that sound like something that would work for you?

Customer: Yeah, okay. That's... that's actually pretty helpful. Thank you. Will I get a confirmation or something?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm putting all of this through right now... (typing sounds) ...and you should receive an email confirmation within the next 15 minutes or so. It'll show the credit applied to your current bill and the new rate that goes into effect next month. You'll also get an updated bill within the next few days reflecting all of these changes.

Customer: Okay, good. And just to confirm—in six months, I should expect the rate to go back up again unless I call?

Agent: That's correct, yes. In six months, your rate would go back to the standard $99.99 unless something changes or you reach out to us before then. But I'd recommend reaching out maybe a week or two before that period ends, and we can look at what promotions are available at that time.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate you helping me out with this. I'm sorry for being a little... you know, upset at the beginning there.

Agent: Please, don't apologize at all. This is exactly why I'm here. Your concerns were completely valid. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and please feel free to reach out if you need anything else. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye!

Agent: Bye!
