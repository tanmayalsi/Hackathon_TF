# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, it seems way too high anyway.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Jennifer Hartley.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, Jennifer. Let me pull up your account here... Okay, I'm looking at your account now. What specifically were you concerned about on your bill?

Customer: Well, first of all, my internet bill went up like thirty dollars a month. I've been with you guys for, I don't know, three years now? And I've never had it go up that much before. And then there's this charge here for... it says "equipment fee upgrade" or something? That's like another twenty bucks, and I don't remember authorizing that.

Agent: (pause) I understand your frustration, Jennifer. Let me address both of those for you. The service plan increase... (typing sounds) so it looks like your promotional pricing expired on your account last month. You were on a three-year locked rate for $79.99 a month, and that term ended, so you've been moved to our standard rate of $109.99 for the same gigabit fiber service.

Customer: Wait, wait—so you're just automatically raising my rate when the contract ends? Nobody told me about this. I mean, I would've appreciated a heads up.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize that you didn't receive a more direct notification about that. We do typically send notices about this, but they can sometimes get overlooked. However, the good news is that I can absolutely help you with that. We do have promotions available for existing customers. Let me see what I can do here.

(typing sounds)

Agent: Okay, so I'm looking at some options for you. I can offer you a promotional rate of $89.99 a month for the next twelve months if you'd like. That would bring your bill down from the $109.99.

Customer: That's still ten dollars more than what I was paying.

Agent: You're right, it is. Unfortunately, that's the best promotional rate I can offer for the gigabit service in your area right now. However, if you were interested in our standard fiber plan at 300 megabits, I could get you to $74.99 a month, which would actually be less than your original rate.

Customer: But I like the gigabit speed. I use it for working from home, and honestly, I don't want to downgrade. I just... I feel like I'm being punished for being a loyal customer, you know?

Agent: I hear you, and I really do appreciate your loyalty. (pause) Let me see what else I can do. Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Sure.

(hold music for approximately 20 seconds)

Agent: Jennifer? I'm back. So I've consulted with my supervisor, and what I can do is this: I can offer you the gigabit service at $94.99 a month for the next twelve months. That's a bit better than the $89.99 I mentioned. That would only be fifteen dollars more than your original promotional rate.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's... that's better. But what about this equipment fee?

Agent: Right, let me explain that. It looks like on February 14th, we upgraded your modem to our newer Wi-Fi 6 modem at no charge, but there was an optional equipment fee that was added. Let me pull up the notes here... (typing sounds) It shows that you accepted the upgrade through our automated system, but the fee shouldn't have been applied automatically like this. That's my mistake—or rather, the system's error.

Customer: I definitely didn't authorize any fee. I mean, if you upgraded my modem, that's nice, but I shouldn't be charged extra for it.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that. I'm going to remove that $19.99 equipment fee from your account right now. (typing sounds) Okay, that's been credited back to you.

Customer: Oh, okay. Well, that's good.

Agent: And just to make sure everything is crystal clear: I'm applying that $94.99 promotional rate for twelve months starting with your next billing cycle. So your next bill should reflect that rate, and you shouldn't see that equipment fee anymore. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's... that's actually pretty reasonable. I appreciate you working with me on that. It just would've been nice to know about the rate increase before it hit my bill, you know?

Agent: Absolutely, and I hear you. I'm actually going to make a note on your account to send you a reminder about sixty days before this promotion expires, so you're not caught off guard again. How does that sound?

Customer: That sounds great, actually. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome, Jennifer. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. You've been really helpful.

Agent: Great. I appreciate that. Just to recap: I've removed the equipment fee of $19.99, and you're all set with the $94.99 monthly rate for the next year. You should see those changes reflected on your next bill. And remember, we'll send you that reminder before the promotion ends. Your service is going to continue as is, so you shouldn't experience any interruption.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, Jennifer. We really do appreciate your business, and we hope you continue to enjoy your gigabit fiber service. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
