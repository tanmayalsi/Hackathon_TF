Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually, I do recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it, and I need to know why it's there.

Agent: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And just to confirm, is this for the account under the name Michael Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And what charge were you concerned about today, Michael?

Customer: So, my bill jumped from $79.99 to $129.99, and when I looked at the itemized charges, there's this thing called a "Fiber Tech Installation Upgrade" for fifty bucks. I never authorized that. I didn't ask for any upgrade. My internet was working fine.

Agent: (pause) I understand your frustration. Let me look into your account history here and see what might have happened. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your service history... It looks like on the 14th of last month, there was a service modification made to your account.

Customer: Right, but I didn't call in to ask for that. Did someone on your end just add this without asking me?

Agent: Let me check the notes here... (pause) Okay, I'm seeing that the ticket shows a standard upgrade was applied. Can I ask—do you remember receiving any notifications about a service improvement or offer from us?

Customer: I mean, maybe? I get a ton of emails. But my point is I didn't actively ask for this. And even if I somehow did, I think you guys should've been clearer about the cost before just charging me.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that confusion. That's a fair point. (pause) Okay, so looking at the notes, it appears that this was applied as part of a promotional tier upgrade. According to our records, your service was upgraded from our standard 300 megabit plan to our 500 megabit fiber plan.

Customer: But I didn't want that! I didn't need faster internet. My kids stream Netflix and I work from home, and honestly, the old speed was fine. Why would you upgrade me without confirming first?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Michael. And I apologize—that should have been confirmed with you explicitly before the charge was applied. Let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) Give me just one second...

Customer: (background noise of papers shuffling) Yeah, I'm looking at the bill now, and it's just... I mean, fifty dollars more a month? That's significant.

Agent: I hear you. Okay, so I have a couple of options for you here. First, I can go ahead and reverse this upgrade and bring your service and your bill back down to where it was at $79.99. That's definitely something we can do.

Customer: Well, I mean... (pause) will that be immediate?

Agent: It will be on your next billing cycle. So depending on where you are in your cycle, it could be as soon as a few days or up to about three weeks. But the charge won't reappear after that.

Customer: Okay, and the fifty dollars I already paid—can you credit that back to my account?

Agent: (pause) That's a great question. Let me check into that for you. (typing sounds) So, looking at our policy here, I can actually issue a one-time courtesy credit for this month. However, because the service was technically active on your account for the full billing period, I can credit you $30 as a gesture of goodwill. How does that sound?

Customer: It's not fifty dollars, but... I mean, I guess that's better than nothing. Will you make sure the upgrade actually gets removed this time? Because I don't want to be surprised again next month.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to manually note this right here in your account. (typing sounds) I'm putting a flag on your profile right now that says "Customer does not authorize service upgrades without explicit verbal consent." I'm also going to add a note that you're being downgraded back to the 300 megabit standard plan effective immediately.

Customer: Okay, that's good. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. And Michael, I apologize again for this situation. It shouldn't have happened. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your account or service?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... in the future, if someone's going to upgrade my service and it's going to cost more money, maybe call the customer or send them a confirmation email or something, you know?

Agent: You know what, that's excellent feedback, and I'm actually going to make a note of that as well. I'm going to flag this for our customer service team so they're aware. You're right—we should be more proactive about confirming these changes.

Customer: Alright, well, I appreciate that. Thanks for taking care of it.

Agent: My pleasure, Michael. So just to recap what we've done today: I've reversed your service upgrade back to the 300 megabit plan, I've issued a $30 courtesy credit to your account, and I've added notes to prevent any unauthorized changes in the future. You should see that credit on your next bill, and the service change will take effect right away.

Customer: Sounds good. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and we really appreciate your business. You have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
