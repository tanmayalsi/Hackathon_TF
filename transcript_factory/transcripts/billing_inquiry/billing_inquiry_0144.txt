# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on there that shouldn't be. I need to figure out what's going on.

Agent: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get your last name to verify the account?

Customer: Martinez. M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. Alright, I've got your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. What charge were you concerned about?

Customer: Well, that's part of the problem. My bill jumped up like forty dollars from last month. I was paying $89.99, and now it's showing $129.99. I don't remember signing up for anything new, and I definitely didn't authorize a price increase like that.

Agent: I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me take a look at what changed on your account. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your billing history here. It looks like your promotional pricing expired last month.

Customer: What? I didn't know anything about promotional pricing expiring. When was I supposed to find out about this?

Agent: Let me check the details here. It looks like you had an introductory rate of $89.99 for the first twelve months, and that period ended with your last billing cycle. You should have received a notice about this... (typing sounds) It looks like it was sent about thirty days prior to the rate change.

Customer: I mean, I get a lot of mail, but I don't remember seeing anything about this. I've been a customer for... how long is it on here?

Agent: (typing) You've been with us for about fourteen months now.

Customer: Yeah, so basically after a year they jacked up the price? That doesn't seem right. What am I actually paying for at that rate? What's the difference?

Agent: Well, the $89.99 was specifically an introductory rate for new customers. After that promotional period ends, you move to our standard pricing. The $129.99 is what the Fiber 500 plan runs at regularly.

Customer: Okay, so what, I just have to pay that now? There's nothing I can do about it?

Agent: Well, I actually do have some options that might help. (typing sounds) We have loyalty pricing available, especially for customers who've been with us for over a year. Let me see what I can offer you here.

Customer: Okay, that's... that's good to hear.

Agent: (pause) Alright, so I can put you on a new promotional rate of $99.99 per month for the next twelve months. That would be $30 less than the standard rate, and it locks in your price.

Customer: $99.99? So still more than what I was paying, but better than $129.99?

Agent: Yes, exactly. And after those twelve months, we can review your account again to see what other options might be available at that time.

Customer: Hmm. I guess that's... I mean, it's not ideal, but at least it's something. What do I need to do?

Agent: Great. I can actually apply that right now to your account if you'd like. It would take effect on your next billing cycle, which would be... (typing) June 15th. You'll see the new rate reflected on your next invoice.

Customer: And there's nothing else hidden, right? No other charges are going to pop up?

Agent: No, this is just for your internet service. This is your Fiber 500 plan at $99.99 monthly. You won't see any other surprises.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, go ahead and apply that then.

Agent: Perfect, let me process that for you now. (typing sounds, pause) Alright, it's all set. Your account has been updated. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just wish I'd known about this promotion being available before I called in upset, you know?

Agent: I completely understand. I apologize that you had to contact us to find out about that option. Moving forward, we'll make sure those renewal notices are clearer. And hey, you might want to keep an eye on your email about a month before your next promotional rate expires—that way you'll know what's coming up.

Customer: Yeah, I will. Thanks for taking care of this.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for calling Frontier, and we appreciate your business, Mr. Martinez. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
