Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm seeing a charge that I don't think should be there. My bill went up like thirty dollars out of nowhere.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your bill. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one moment while I pull that up. Just to confirm, is this account under the name Michael Torres?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account here. I can see your current bill is $89.99. Can you tell me what you were paying before?

Customer: It was sixty, I think? Sixty dollars. Maybe sixty-five? I don't have last month's bill in front of me, but I know it was way less than this. And I didn't authorize any upgrades or anything. I've been with you guys for like, three years now, and it's always been the same price.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at your service history here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing that your plan was... actually, it looks like you were on a promotional rate that expired. Your introductory pricing period ended last month. So your rate has adjusted to our standard rate for that speed tier.

Customer: Wait, what? A promotional rate? I was never told anything about that. Nobody said my bill was going to go up. That seems kind of... I mean, that's not fair, right?

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from. Unfortunately, promotional rates do have expiration dates, and they're typically outlined in the service agreement. However, let me see what options we might have available to you. (pause) So you've been a loyal customer for three years, which is great. I might be able to look at some current promotions or plan adjustments that could help bring that cost down a bit.

Customer: Okay, well, I mean... I appreciate that. But like, shouldn't you have told me? Shouldn't you have sent me something or called me or... I don't know, given me a heads up before just charging me thirty more dollars?

Agent: That's actually a really fair point, and I apologize that you didn't receive a notification. We do try to send those out, but sometimes they can get lost in the mail or filtered to spam if sent via email. Let me make a note on your account about that. (typing sounds) In the meantime, let me see what I can do for you. 

Are you interested in maybe switching to a different plan? We've actually got a pretty good bundle deal right now—internet, TV, and phone for a competitive rate. Or, if you just want internet, we have a promotion running right now where new customers get twelve months at $54.99 for our 100 megabit plan.

Customer: Hold on—so new customers get a better deal than someone who's been loyal for three years? That's... that doesn't make sense.

Agent: (brief pause) I hear you. You're right, and that is frustrating. Unfortunately, that's how promotions typically work in this industry, but I don't want to leave you hanging. What if I could offer you our 100 megabit plan for $59.99 for the next twelve months? That would actually be less than your original promotional rate.

Customer: So I'd be paying $59.99?

Agent: Yes, exactly. That's about ten dollars less than what you were paying before, and you'd also be locked in at that rate for a full year. After that, it would go back to the standard rate unless we have another promotion available.

Customer: (pause) I mean... that's better, I guess. But I want to make sure—there's no hidden stuff after a year, right? Like, you're being upfront with me?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to note everything on your account right now. The promotion is for exactly twelve months—from today until [inaudible]—and then the rate will adjust. We will send you a notice at least thirty days before that happens so you're not caught off guard again. You have my word on that. And if you'd like, I can even flag your account for an outreach call a month before your promotion ends, just to go over your options.

Customer: Okay, yeah. I'd appreciate that, actually. Can you do that?

Agent: Already done. (typing sounds) I'm putting in a note right now for our retention team to reach out to you on... let's say November 15th. How does that sound?

Customer: Yeah, that's good. Thanks. Um, so when does this new rate take effect?

Agent: Great question. This will take effect on your next billing cycle, which based on your account, would be next Tuesday. So you should see the adjusted rate on your next bill.

Customer: Okay. And I'm not going to get charged twice or anything weird like that?

Agent: No, no. Everything will be prorated correctly. You're all set. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this, Marcus.

Agent: Of course. Thank you so much for being a customer with us for these three years, and I really do apologize for the confusion with the promotion. If you have any issues with your service going forward, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help.

Customer: Thanks. Have a good one.

Agent: You too. Thanks for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day.
