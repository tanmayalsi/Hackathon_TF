Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm really upset about a charge I'm seeing here.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... and I'm seeing an account under the name... is this Jennifer Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. So you mentioned there's a charge on your bill that you're concerned about. Can you tell me which charge that is?

Customer: Yeah, so I've been a customer with you guys for like... three years now? And my bill has always been around $79.99 for the gig internet and the basic TV package. But this month it jumped to $119.99. That's like... forty dollars more! I didn't authorize any changes or anything.

Agent: Oh wow, I completely understand your frustration. Let me take a look at what happened here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history and I see that... it looks like your promotional rate expired on your account.

Customer: Promotional rate? I wasn't on a promotional rate. I've been paying the same price for years.

Agent: Right, so what I'm seeing here is that you originally signed up back in April of 2021 with a promotional rate of $79.99 for twelve months, and then it looks like it was extended... (pause) ...it was extended for another promotional period. But that second promotional period ended on your last billing cycle, which is why you're seeing the increase to our standard rate of $119.99.

Customer: But nobody told me about that! I didn't know the promotion was ending. If I had known, I would've... I don't know, called in or done something. This is really unfair.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize that you weren't notified before that rate changed. Unfortunately, I'm seeing that we did send out a notice about thirty days before the change took effect. Do you happen to remember receiving anything in the mail about that?

Customer: (pause) I... I mean, I probably got something, but honestly, I get so much mail. I didn't realize it was about my internet bill. Couldn't you guys be clearer about that or send an email or something?

Agent: That's actually really good feedback, and I hear you. We do send emails as well, but I'm not seeing that you have an email address on file for notifications. Would you be willing to add one?

Customer: I... yeah, I guess so. But that doesn't really solve my problem right now. I can't just afford to pay an extra forty bucks a month. What can you do about this?

Agent: Let me see what options I have here for you. (typing sounds) So, I can definitely look into getting you back on a promotional rate. We do have some current promotions running. Let me check what you'd qualify for... (pause) Okay, so I can get you on a promotion for $89.99 a month for the next twelve months for your gig internet and TV package. That would be...

Customer: That's still ten dollars more than what I was paying before though.

Agent: I understand. The thing is, our standard rates have increased across the board since you first signed up, so this promo rate of $89.99 is actually one of our better offerings right now. But I can also make a note on your account. Let me see if I can get my supervisor to approve a one-time credit for this month to cover the difference, which would bring this month back down to what you were paying.

Customer: Okay, so you'd credit me the difference?

Agent: Yes, that's what I'm going to try to do. It won't happen automatically, but I'm going to request a courtesy credit of $40 for this billing cycle. That typically processes within 2 to 3 business days. You should see it on your next bill or shortly after.

Customer: And then I'd be on the $89.99 rate going forward?

Agent: Exactly. For the next twelve months, and we'll be sure to add your email address so you get a notification thirty days before that rate expires. That way you won't be caught off guard again.

Customer: (pause) Okay, well... I mean, I wish it could go back to the original price, but I appreciate you trying to help. Can I ask... is there anything else I'm paying for that I might not need? Like, could I lower my plan or something?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me ask you a few things. How often are you using the TV service versus just streaming?

Customer: Honestly? I barely watch it. I use Netflix and stuff mostly. I only really have the TV package because it was bundled together and seemed cheaper at the time.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. So if you removed the TV package, your internet-only rate with the promotion would be $49.99 a month. That would be a pretty significant savings compared to what you're looking at right now.

Customer: Wait, really? Just for internet? Will I lose speed or anything?

Agent: No, you'd still have the full gig speed—that's 1 gigabit download speeds. It's the same service, just without the TV channels.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. Let's do that then. That makes way more sense for me.

Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to update your account to remove the TV package effective immediately, get you on the $49.99 promotional rate for twelve months, apply that $40 courtesy credit to your current bill, and add your email to our notification list. Can I get that email address from you?

Customer: It's jennifer.martinez.1987@emailprovider.com

Agent: (typing sounds) Great. Let me just read that back to you to make sure I have it right. Jennifer dot Martinez dot 1987 at emailprovider dot com?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And Jennifer, I want you to know that you should be receiving a confirmation email shortly with all these changes. Your next bill will reflect the new plan and should include that $40 credit. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's good. Thank you for working with me on this. I appreciate it.

Agent: Of course, and again, I apologize for the confusion with the rate change. We really do value you as a customer, and I'm glad we could get this sorted out. Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye.

Agent: Bye!
