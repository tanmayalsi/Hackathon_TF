Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I noticed that my rate went up. Like, significantly. I've been a customer for almost five years now, and I don't remember authorizing any changes to my plan.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're concerned about your bill. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my phone number with you guys.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. Let me just pull that up here... Alright, I'm looking at your account now. I can see you've been with us since March of 2019. That's great! And I'm seeing your most recent bill from last month. Can you tell me what you're seeing as the increase?

Customer: Well, I was paying $79.99 a month for the Gig Internet plan, right? And now it's showing $99.99. That's... that's twenty dollars more! I don't know where that came from. Did I agree to something without knowing it?

Agent: (pause) Let me look into that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm pulling up the details here. It looks like... actually, I'm seeing that you were on a promotional rate that expired. Your promotional period ended at the end of last month, so your rate adjusted to our standard pricing for the Gig Internet plan.

Customer: A promotional rate? I mean... I guess maybe when I signed up, but nobody called me to tell me it was ending. That seems like something you should notify customers about before you just charge them more.

Agent: You know, that's actually a really fair point, and I completely understand your frustration. (pause) Let me see what options we have available for you. You know, we do have some flexibility here. Since you've been such a loyal customer for nearly five years, I'd like to see what we can do.

Customer: I appreciate that. I'm not trying to be difficult, but like... I budget for this stuff, and a twenty-dollar jump is noticeable, you know?

Agent: Absolutely, I get it. (typing sounds) Okay, so what I'm seeing is that I can offer you a new promotional rate. We have a special right now where I can put you back down to $84.99 per month for the next twelve months. That way you'd only be looking at a five-dollar increase instead of twenty, and after the year is up, we'll contact you in advance before anything changes again.

Customer: So that's... that's definitely better than twenty dollars. But why couldn't I have gotten this before I saw it on my bill? Couldn't someone have reached out?

Agent: That's a legitimate question, and I apologize that didn't happen. Our system should have flagged that your promo was ending, and ideally you would have heard from us. I'm genuinely sorry about that oversight. But I can absolutely make sure this doesn't catch you off guard again. I'm going to add a note to your account that you should receive a courtesy call thirty days before any rate changes going forward.

Customer: (pause) Okay... yeah, that does help. I'll take the $84.99 rate then. But I want to make sure—that's locked in for a full year, right? Twelve months?

Agent: Yes, exactly. For the next twelve months, your rate will be $84.99. And again, you'll hear from us before anything changes after that period ends.

Customer: Alright. And that goes into effect when? On my next bill?

Agent: (typing sounds) Yes, it'll be reflected on your next billing cycle, which should be... looks like around the 15th of next month. You'll see the adjustment then.

Customer: Okay, I think that works. Thank you for fixing that.

Agent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize that you had to call in for this. I really do appreciate your patience and your loyalty to Frontier. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I'm good.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you so much for calling, and we really appreciate your business. If you need anything else in the future, just don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Thanks, Marcus. Have a good day.

Agent: You too! Take care.
