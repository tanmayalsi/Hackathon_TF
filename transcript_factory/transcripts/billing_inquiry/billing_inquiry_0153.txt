Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually I do recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it, and it seems way too high.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this for an account under the name Michael Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And which charge are you calling about today?

Customer: It's... okay, so I've been with Frontier for like three years now, right? And I've always paid $79.99 a month for the gigabit fiber package. But this month the bill came and it says $119.99. That's a forty dollar increase! I didn't authorize that.

Agent: I understand that must be frustrating. Let me take a look at your account here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing the rate change. So it looks like you were on a promotional rate that expired at the end of last month. Your three-year promotional period ended, and your account has moved to our standard pricing for the gigabit fiber service.

Customer: Wait, what? I was never told about that. I mean, I didn't get any notification or anything. That seems pretty sneaky to me.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. Let me check the notes on your account to see what communications were sent out. (pause) (typing sounds) So I am showing that we sent out a notice about two months ago, and then another courtesy reminder about thirty days before the rate change took effect. These would have come through email based on your account settings.

Customer: Okay, well, I... I mean, I get a lot of emails, you know? I probably just missed it. But still, I signed up for that rate. Why would you just change it like that without more of a heads up?

Agent: That's a fair question. So the promotional pricing is typically a limited-time offer, usually for the first one to three years, and then it converts to our standard rate after that period ends. I know it can be surprising when that happens, and I'm sorry you didn't see those notices. But I do want to help you out here.

Customer: Okay, so... can we do anything about this? Can I go back to the old rate or...?

Agent: Let me see what options we have for you. (pause) (typing sounds) So right now I'm looking at current promotions we have available. We do have a loyalty offer that I can apply to your account. It would bring your rate down to $99.99 a month for the next twelve months, and then it would go back to the standard rate after that. How does that sound?

Customer: So it's still thirty dollars more than what I was paying before?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. After your three-year promotional period, the standard pricing for our gigabit fiber service is $119.99. The loyalty rate would be $99.99, so you'd be saving twenty dollars a month compared to the standard rate.

Customer: (sighs) Hmm. That's... I mean, it's better than paying the full amount, I guess. But I'm not thrilled about it. I've been a customer for three years, never missed a payment, and I feel like you guys are just... punishing loyalty, you know?

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate your loyalty as a customer. That's exactly why I wanted to get you into this loyalty program. Unfortunately, after the promotional period, we do need to move customers to our standard pricing, but I do have some flexibility here. Let me see if I can do a little better for you. (typing sounds) (pause) You know what, I'm going to put you on a special rate. I can offer you $94.99 a month for the next twelve months. That's the best I can do in the system, but it should help bridge that gap a bit.

Customer: Oh. Okay, well, that's... that's a lot better actually. So that's $94.99 for a year, and then what happens after that?

Agent: After the twelve months, it would go back to the standard rate of $119.99 per month, unless another promotion becomes available at that time. But we can absolutely discuss options again when that happens. For now, this new rate would start with your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay. Yeah, I mean, I appreciate that. That helps. Can you also... is there any way I can get a credit for this month? I was charged the higher amount and I didn't know about it.

Agent: That's a good question. Let me look into that for you. (pause) (typing sounds) So I can't issue a full credit since technically the rate change was communicated, but I can apply a one-time courtesy credit of $25 to your account for this billing cycle. How's that?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean, that's not the full difference, but I appreciate it. Okay, I'll take it.

Agent: Great. So let me just confirm everything here. I'm applying the $94.99 promotional rate for the next twelve months starting with your next billing cycle. I'm also adding a $25 courtesy credit to your current bill. And just to make sure you're in the loop going forward, would you like me to update your contact preferences so you get notifications via text message as well as email for rate changes?

Customer: Actually, yeah, that might be good. Can you add my cell phone number?

Agent: Absolutely. What's the best number to reach you at?

Customer: It's 555-0921.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, I've added that to your account. So you'll get notifications via email and text message going forward. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you for working with me on this, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and I'm sorry again for the confusion with the rate change. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.
