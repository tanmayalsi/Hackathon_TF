Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Marcus. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my rate went up. I've been a customer for like three years and nobody told me about this.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: Yeah, it's area code 407, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I also get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I've got your account right here. I'm seeing that you're on our Gig Speed plan. Is that the account you're calling about?

Customer: Yes, that one. So I was paying $79.99 a month, and now this month it jumped to $94.99. That's like fifteen bucks more! And then there's this other charge for... (pause) ...it says "Installation Equipment Fee - $49.99." I never asked for any new equipment.

Agent: Okay, I see what you're looking at. Let me explain both of those for you. First, regarding the rate increase—we did send out a notification about that. It should have been included in your bill from last month or maybe the month before. (pause) The Gig Speed plan in your area is being transitioned to our new pricing structure. Your rate went from $79.99 to $94.99.

Customer: Well, I didn't see any notification. That seems like a big jump. Why is it going up so much?

Agent: I understand your frustration, David. The increase reflects the enhanced infrastructure investment we've made in your area and the service improvements you're receiving. However... (typing sounds) I'm seeing here that you've been a loyal customer for three years, which I really appreciate. Let me see what I can do for you on this. But first, let me address that equipment charge because I think that might be the real issue here.

Customer: Yeah, what is that about? I definitely didn't order anything.

Agent: Can you tell me if you've had any service visits or technician appointments recently? Anything in the last month or two?

Customer: Oh! Um, yeah, actually we had a guy come out like... six weeks ago? Maybe? My internet was going down a lot, so I called and they said they'd send someone out to check the line.

Agent: Okay, that's likely what this is. When a technician comes out for a service call and identifies that your equipment needs to be replaced or upgraded—in this case, probably a modem or router—there is a one-time installation fee associated with that. It looks like they swapped out your equipment during that visit.

Customer: But I wasn't charged before for that. They came out once before like two years ago for something and I wasn't charged anything extra.

Agent: (pause) That's a fair point. Let me look at your history here... (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing that two years ago when they did a service visit, they replaced your modem at no charge. So this is a bit inconsistent. Let me be honest with you—the installation fee shouldn't have been assessed without you being informed ahead of time. That's on us. I can actually remove that charge for you right now.

Customer: Really? You can just do that?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I'm going to credit your account $49.99 for that installation fee. (typing sounds) Done. You should see that reflected on your next bill, or you can check your account online in the next couple hours. 

Customer: Oh, okay, that's good. What about the rate increase though?

Agent: Right, so about that increase. So as I mentioned, this is a plan-wide adjustment we're making. However, given your tenure with us and the billing issue we just discussed, I'd like to offer you a rate lock. I can lock you in at $84.99 per month for the next twelve months, which gives you a ten-dollar discount from the new rate.

Customer: So instead of $94.99, I'd pay $84.99?

Agent: That's correct. That's still higher than your previous $79.99, but it's a five-dollar monthly increase instead of fifteen. And after the twelve months, rates would be reviewed at that time. But you'd have that price locked in guaranteed.

Customer: (pause) I mean, I guess that's better than nothing. Can I ask why you can't just keep it at the old rate? I've been paying on time, I've never had any issues besides that one service call.

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from. Unfortunately, the rate adjustment is system-wide and I don't have the ability to grandfather customers in at the old tier. It's coming from corporate. But this locked rate for a year is the best I can do for you, and it does save you ten dollars a month during that period, so that's a hundred and twenty dollars in savings.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I'll take it. Can you make sure this is actually on my account though? Because I don't want to be surprised again.

Agent: Absolutely. Let me confirm everything for you. I'm putting a note here that you've been offered a twelve-month rate lock at $84.99 per month, and I'm also noting that the $49.99 installation fee has been credited. You should receive a confirmation email within the next couple hours, and your next bill will reflect both of these changes.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today, David?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I wish you guys would've been more upfront about the rate increase. I almost switched providers when I saw that bill.

Agent: I really do understand, and I apologize that the notification wasn't as clear as it should have been. We value your business, and we're glad we could work this out. If you ever have any issues in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, David. Have a great day!

Customer: You too.
