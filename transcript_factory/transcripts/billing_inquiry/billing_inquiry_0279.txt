Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, I'm also pretty upset about a price increase I wasn't expecting.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number too.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And what's the best name to have on the account?

Customer: It's James Martinez.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, James. Let me pull up your account here... Alright, I've got you. I see your most recent bill from last month. Can you tell me which charge is concerning you, or would you like me to walk you through what I'm seeing?

Customer: Well, there's... I think it's a 15-dollar charge that just says "premium router rental." I've never paid for that before, and I definitely don't remember agreeing to that.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I see that. The premium router rental is $14.99 per month. That would have been added to your account. Let me look into when that was added... (typing sounds) It looks like that was provisioned to your account about 60 days ago. Do you remember receiving any notification about that, or...?

Customer: No, I didn't get any notification. And like, I already have a router. Why would I need to rent another one from you guys?

Agent: That's a great question. The premium router is our latest model, and it does offer some enhanced features like better WiFi coverage and dual-band connectivity. But you're right—if you already have a functioning router, you wouldn't necessarily need it. Let me ask you this: have you been experiencing any connectivity issues or anything like that?

Customer: No, actually my internet's been fine. So I don't understand why this charge suddenly appeared on my bill.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me look at the notes here... (typing sounds) I'm not seeing a service call or anything that would have triggered this being added to your account. It's possible this may have been added in error, or perhaps there was a promotion or something that got applied. But the good news is we can definitely remove this for you if you'd like to use your own router.

Customer: Yes, please. I want that off my bill.

Agent: Absolutely. I can take care of that right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm going to remove the premium router rental effective immediately. You should see that credit reflected on your next billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: Yeah, actually. My bill went up like... almost 20 bucks this month, and I don't know why. I've had the same plan for like two years. What's going on with that?

Agent: (pause) Let me take a look at that for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your billing history. I do see that your bill increased. Can you tell me what your previous bill was compared to this current one?

Customer: Last month it was like $89.99, and this month it's $109.47. That's almost twenty dollars, Derek.

Agent: I see that. That is a noticeable increase. (typing sounds) Okay, so looking back at your account notes, I'm seeing that you were previously on a promotional rate that expired. You were grandfathered in on a legacy plan with a 24-month promotional pricing of $89.99 per month. That promotion ended on the first of this month, and your plan has reverted to our standard rate for that speed tier, which is $104.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. So you're telling me I had some kind of deal that expired and nobody told me? That seems like something you guys should have notified me about.

Agent: You know, that's fair feedback. Looking at the account, I'm not seeing a courtesy notification that was sent out, which normally we do try to send out around 30 days before a promotional rate expires. I apologize for that. But I do want to help make this right if I can. Let me see what options are available to you.

Customer: Okay, because this is frustrating. I like my service, but I'm not trying to pay all this extra money without knowing about it.

Agent: (typing sounds) I completely understand. So, what I can do is I can look at some options. We do have some current promotions running. I can see if you'd qualify for a different plan that might save you some money, or I could potentially apply a promotional rate back to your account. But I will need to let you know upfront that it wouldn't be the same rate as before—promotional rates do change. Would you be interested in exploring that?

Customer: Yeah, I mean... if I can get something better than what I'm paying now, I'm interested. What are we talking about?

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, so currently for your speed tier—I see you have our 500 megabit plan—I can offer you a rate of $79.99 per month for the first 12 months, and then it would go to $94.99 after that. That would be a solid savings for the first year.

Customer: Okay, that's better. But what happens after the 12 months? You're gonna jack my rate up again?

Agent: That's a good question. After the promotional period, yes, it would move to the standard rate of $94.99. But that's still less than what you're paying now. And honestly, I'd recommend checking back in with us around month 11 to see what promotions might be available then. We can always look at other options before your rate increases.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I guess that works. But I'm not happy about the way this was handled.

Agent: I hear you, and I really do apologize for the lack of notification. I'm gonna make sure we get that 12-month promotion applied to your account today. And I'm also going to remove that router charge, like we discussed. So that's going to bring your bill down. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Just... try to make sure I get a heads up next time before my rate goes up, okay?

Agent: Absolutely. I've added a note to your account about that, and we'll definitely try to reach out in advance next time. I appreciate your patience, James, and I'm sorry again for the frustration. You should see both of those changes reflected on your next bill. Is there anything else before I let you go?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, James. Have a great day.

Customer: You too.
