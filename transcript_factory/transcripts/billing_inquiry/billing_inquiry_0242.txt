Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and I'm also pretty upset about my rate going up again.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... um, 555-0147. That's my phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And just to verify, is this for the address on Oak Street?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. And what's your name?

Customer: James Chen.

Agent: Alright, James, I've got your account here. So you're seeing a charge you don't recognize and a rate increase. Let me start by looking at your current bill. Can you tell me what the unfamiliar charge is for?

Customer: Well, there's... it says here "Equipment Rental Fee" and it's like, thirty dollars? I've never seen this before. We've had the same modem for like, three years.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I see that. Let me look into your account history here. (typing sounds) So it looks like... hmm, that fee was actually added to your account about two months ago. Do you remember receiving any notification about that?

Customer: No, I... I mean, I might've gotten something in the mail, but I don't think anyone explained what it was for. And honestly, I already own that modem. Why am I paying to rent something I own?

Agent: That's a really good question. Let me pull up your service details. (pause) Okay, so according to our records, the modem you have is actually... it's our company equipment that was provided with your original installation. So technically, you've been leasing it this whole time, but that equipment fee wasn't showing up separately on your bill before.

Customer: What? That doesn't make any sense. It was never broken out like this before. Why is it suddenly appearing now?

Agent: I understand your frustration. It looks like we made a system update about three months ago that changed how equipment fees are itemized on bills. Instead of being bundled into your service package, they now appear as a separate line item. It's the same charge you were technically paying before, just... displayed differently.

Customer: Okay, well, that's still confusing, but... I guess I can deal with that. But what I'm really mad about is the rate increase. I'm paying like, thirty-five dollars more a month now than I was six months ago. That's almost fifty percent more! For what?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) Let me check on that for you. So your service plan is the 500 Mbps fiber package?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Okay, so I'm seeing your base rate actually hasn't changed in about fourteen months. But I do see that in the last billing cycle, your promotional rate ended. It looks like you were on a promotional pricing period for twelve months, and that expired. So the increase you're seeing is the difference between the promotional price and the regular price.

Customer: What? I didn't... nobody told me my promotional rate was going to end. When did this happen?

Agent: So according to our records, we should have sent you a notification about sixty days before the promotional period ended. [inaudible] let me just verify... that would have been back in April?

Customer: I mean... maybe? I get a lot of mail. But is there... I mean, can't you do anything about this? I've been a customer for like, five years.

Agent: (pause) I really appreciate your loyalty, James. Let me see what options we have here. (typing sounds) So unfortunately, I'm not able to retroactively apply the promotional rate, but I do have some flexibility to offer you a new promotional offer. I can put you on a discounted rate for the next twelve months at... let me see here... four hundred and nineteen dollars a month for your 500 Mbps service. That would be a savings of about twenty-five dollars compared to your current regular rate.

Customer: So I'd still be paying more than what I was paying during the promo period?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. The new promotional rate would be higher than the previous one, but it would be a significant savings from your current regular rate.

Customer: (pause) Ugh. Okay, I guess that's better than nothing. But I'm still not happy about that equipment fee showing up. Can you at least remove that for this month?

Agent: Let me look into that for you. (pause, typing sounds) So, the equipment fee is part of your service package, but since this is the first time it's appearing as a line item and it was a system change on our end, I can actually credit you for one month. How does that sound?

Customer: Yeah, okay. I'll take it. So that's a thirty-dollar credit this month, and then the new promotional rate going forward?

Agent: Exactly right. So I'm going to apply that thirty-dollar equipment fee credit, which should appear on your next bill. And the new promotional rate of four hundred and nineteen dollars will start on your next billing cycle, which is... (typing sounds) March fifteenth. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I... I think that's it. I still think you guys should've made this clearer, but I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: I completely understand, and I appreciate your patience. We'll definitely look into improving our notifications about promotional periods ending. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's all.

Agent: Alright, James. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and thanks for calling. Have a great day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.
