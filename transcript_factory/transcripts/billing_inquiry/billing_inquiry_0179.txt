Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. It's... it's pretty significant and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my service line.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, give me just one second here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's under James Mitchell.

Agent: Perfect, James. I'm pulling that up now. (pause) Alright, I've got your account here. I see you're on our Fiber 300 plan. What charge are you seeing that's concerning you?

Customer: Well, there's... okay, so I've been paying $79.99 for the last like, I don't know, six months or so? And this month my bill jumped to $99.99. That's a $20 increase and nobody told me anything about it. I didn't authorize any changes to my service.

Agent: I understand, James. That's definitely a significant jump and I can see why you'd want to clarify that. Let me look into this for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history here. It looks like you were on a promotional rate that expired. You were on an introductory offer for twelve months, and that period ended last month.

Customer: Wait, what? An introductory offer? I mean, I've been with you guys for longer than a year. I've been a customer for like two years now.

Agent: Right, so you have been with us for about two years. But it looks like there was a service upgrade that happened about fourteen months ago. Is that... does that sound about right? Did you upgrade your service at any point?

Customer: (hesitating) Um... maybe? I think I might have upgraded from the 100 plan to the 300 plan, but... but that was supposed to be a permanent discount, I thought. When I made that change, they told me I'd get a promotional rate for a year. They didn't say anything about it going up after.

Agent: I completely understand the confusion there, James. Unfortunately, these promotional rates do expire after the promotional period ends. It's in the terms and conditions, but I know that's not always clearly communicated when customers make these changes. (pause) That said, let me see what I can do for you here. I want to make this right.

Customer: Okay, well... I appreciate that. I mean, I don't want to pay $100 a month for internet. That seems really high.

Agent: I hear you. Let me check what options we have available right now. (typing sounds, pause) Alright, so I'm looking at our current promotions. We do have a loyalty offer that I can apply to your account. Since you've been with us for two years and this is your first dispute, I can offer you a new rate of $84.99 per month for the next twelve months. That's still on the Fiber 300 plan, so you keep all your current speeds.

Customer: Hmm, $84.99... That's still more than what I was paying before, though.

Agent: I understand. The difference is that the previous rate was an introductory rate, which is typically lower than what we charge ongoing customers. The $84.99 is discounted from our standard rate of $99.99, so you're saving about $15 a month. And after the twelve months, your rate would go back to the standard $99.99 unless another promotion becomes available.

Customer: (sighs) So basically, I'm just going to keep seeing increases?

Agent: I can't make promises about future promotions, James, but I can tell you that we do continuously evaluate offers for our loyal customers. What I'm doing today is giving you the best rate I can right now, and locking it in for another year. After that year, you'd be eligible to discuss your options again if rates increase.

Customer: (pause) Okay... I guess $84.99 is better than $99.99. But I'm not happy about the way this was handled. It really should have been clearer that the promotion was ending.

Agent: I absolutely hear you on that, and I apologize that the communication could have been better. I'm going to make a note on your account about this conversation. Would you like me to go ahead and apply this $84.99 rate to your account?

Customer: Yeah, yeah, go ahead and do it.

Agent: Perfect. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm applying that now. This rate of $84.99 will be effective immediately, so you should see it on your next billing cycle. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly with the details. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I just... I really do wish you guys had sent a notification or something before the rate increase happened.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'm going to pass that feedback along to our customer service team. Your input helps us improve our process. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, James, and thank you for calling in today.

Customer: Alright, thanks Derek. Bye.

Agent: You have a great day, James. Bye now.
