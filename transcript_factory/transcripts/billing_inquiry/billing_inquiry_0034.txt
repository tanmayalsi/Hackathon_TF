Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I'm looking at my bill that just came in, and I'm seeing a charge that wasn't there before. I was told my rate was locked in, and now it's gone up like fifteen dollars a month. That's not right.

Agent: I'm really sorry you're frustrated with that. Let me pull up your account and take a look at what's going on. Can I get the phone number associated with your account, or your account number if you have that handy?

Customer: Yeah, it's... (rustling sound) ...555-0147. That's the phone number we use with Frontier.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Sarah Mitchell.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Sarah, I'm looking at your account here. I can see your service started back in March of this year. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right. We switched from cable internet because you guys were running that promotion. The rep said we'd have the same price for the first year, and then... I don't know, he said something about after that, but I definitely didn't expect it to jump this much.

Agent: (pause) I understand. Let me take a closer look at the details here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you were on a promotional rate of $49.99 a month for the first twelve months. And looking at your current bill cycle... that would have ended last month, so this bill would be reflecting the standard rate going forward.

Customer: Okay, but like... I mean, that's almost a forty percent increase. When you lock someone in at a rate, you should at least tell them what it's going to jump to before it happens. Nobody called me. I didn't get a letter or anything.

Agent: You know what, you're absolutely right about that, and I apologize. We should have reached out to you before your promotion ended. That's on us. (pause) So the new rate that you're seeing... let me just confirm this is $64.99 a month for our standard Fiber 200 service?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds like the number I'm seeing. It's sixty-four ninety-nine. And I'm trying to figure out if there's anything I can do about it, because we're pretty happy with the service itself, but I don't want to be paying that much. Can I get back on some kind of promotion?

Agent: Let me check what options we have available for you right now. (pause, typing sounds) Unfortunately, the promotional pricing for new customers isn't something I can apply retroactively to existing customers. However... (pause) ...let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) I do see that we have a loyalty program, and based on your account history and the fact that you've been a good customer, I may be able to offer you a small credit or potentially a different rate tier.

Customer: Okay... what are we talking about here? Like what kind of options?

Agent: Well, I can do a couple things. One option would be to give you a one-time bill credit of about thirty dollars for the inconvenience of not being notified. Or... I could potentially move you to our Fiber 100 service, which is a step down from what you have now, and that would be $44.99 a month. I know that's less than the promotional rate you had, actually.

Customer: (pause) Wait, so Fiber 100 is slower than what I have now?

Agent: Yes, it would be. Your current service is 200 megabits per second, and Fiber 100 would be 100 megabits per second. So it's half the speed. Is that something that would work for you, or...?

Customer: (pause) I don't... no, I mean, we use it for streaming and stuff. My husband works from home sometimes. I don't think we'd want to slow it down. (pause) Honestly, that bill credit doesn't really help me much either because the problem is the ongoing charge, you know? Can you not do something better? Like a discount on the regular rate or...?

Agent: (pause, typing sounds) I hear you, Sarah. Let me see what else I might be able to do. (pause) Let me put you on a brief hold while I check with my supervisor about what additional options we might have available. It'll just be a moment.

Customer: Okay, yeah, go ahead.

Agent: (hold music plays for approximately 20 seconds)

Agent: Sarah? Thank you for holding. Okay, so I talked with my supervisor, and here's what we can do. I can offer you a discounted rate of $54.99 a month instead of the full $64.99 for the next six months. After that, the rate would go back to $64.99 unless we have another promotion running at that time. Would that work for you?

Customer: (pause) So I'd be saving ten dollars a month for the next six months, and then it goes back up?

Agent: That's correct, yes. And I would also apply a $30 credit to your next bill to cover the billing issue this cycle.

Customer: (pause) I mean... I guess that's better than nothing. But I'm not thrilled about this, to be honest. I feel like I should have been given more notice about the price increase.

Agent: And I completely understand that frustration, Sarah. You're right—we should have done a better job communicating with you before your rate changed. I'm going to make a note on your account about this, and I'll also have a courtesy call scheduled to reach out to you before your discounted rate expires in six months. That way, we can discuss your options before anything changes again. Does that sound fair?

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah. That does sound better. And the $30 credit will show up on my next bill?

Agent: It absolutely will. You should see that reflected on your next billing statement, which typically goes out around the same time each month. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think... I think that covers it. Thanks for working with me on this, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Sarah. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and I really do apologize again for the inconvenience. If you need anything in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
