Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I was told my internet was going to be, um, $79.99 a month, and now it's showing $94.99. That's a fifteen dollar increase and nobody told me about this.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account real quick so I can take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, perfect. I've got you here. I see an account under the name... is this Robert Chen?

Customer: Yeah, that's me.

Agent: Great, Robert. So I'm looking at your current plan here. You're on our Fiber 500 package. Let me just scroll through your billing history. (pause) Okay, I'm seeing the charges. So what happened is your promotional rate expired. You were on a promotional pricing for the first twelve months, which is why you were paying $79.99, and that promotion ended last month.

Customer: Wait, what? I was never told that my rate would go up. When I signed up, the guy said $79.99 a month. He didn't mention anything about it being temporary.

Agent: I hear you. And I apologize for the confusion. These promotional rates are typically for the first year of service, and then they go to the regular rate after that. Let me check when you first signed up...

Customer: I've been a customer for about fourteen months, so... okay, so the promotion ended after twelve months. But still, shouldn't you guys send me a notification or something before you just raise the price?

Agent: That's a really fair point, and you're right. We should have sent you a notice about the rate change. (typing sounds) Let me see what I can do here to help make this right. Do you have any other services with us, or is it just the internet?

Customer: Just the internet. I was looking at switching to cable anyway because I'm not happy with the price now. Your competitor is offering the same speed for like $65 a month.

Agent: I completely understand, and I'd hate to see you go. Let me see what options I have available for you. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking at our current promotional offerings, and I can actually get you back down to $79.99 if you'd like to commit to another twelve-month contract. That would lock in that rate for the full year.

Customer: Another twelve months? Why should I do that when I can just switch?

Agent: That's fair. But I want to make sure you have all your options. That $65 rate you mentioned... is that a promotional rate or the regular rate?

Customer: (hesitates) Um... I think it's promotional, actually. I'm not totally sure. But still, that's $15 a month cheaper.

Agent: Right. And here's the thing with those other providers—those promo rates typically expire too, and then you're back to paying full price, which often comes out higher than what we're offering. Plus, you've already got service set up with us and you're not experiencing any issues, right?

Customer: No, the service itself is fine. I mean, the internet speed is great. I just don't like feeling like I'm being taken advantage of.

Agent: And that's totally valid. So here's what I can do for you. I can offer you $79.99 for another twelve months, but I can also credit back one month of the overcharge. So that fifteen dollars difference from last month—that would be credited to your account, and your next bill would reflect that credit.

Customer: (pause) Really? You can do that?

Agent: Let me just check with my supervisor real quick to make sure I can apply that credit. Can you give me just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (pause, background hold music) Okay, Robert, thanks for hanging on. So I was able to get approval for that credit. So here's what I'm going to do: I'm crediting your account $15 for the previous month's overcharge, and then if you want to go forward with that $79.99 rate locked in for the next twelve months, I can activate that right now.

Customer: Okay, so my bill next month will be $79.99 minus the $15 credit, so like $65?

Agent: Actually, the credit will show separately on your bill, so you'll see the $79.99 charge and then a credit of $15 applied. So your net will be $64.99. And then the month after that, it'll just be the regular $79.99. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, actually, that's... that's really helpful. Thanks. Can I ask why the guy who signed me up didn't explain this to me in the first place?

Agent: That's a good question, and I apologize that that wasn't communicated clearly. That's something we definitely should have covered. I'm going to make a note in your account about this, and I'll flag it for our sales team so they can improve their process going forward.

Customer: Alright. I appreciate that.

Agent: Great. So let me just confirm everything here. I'm locking in your rate at $79.99 for the next twelve months, starting immediately. I'm applying a one-time credit of $15 for the previous month, and your new contract term runs through... (typing) ...April 15th of next year. You'll receive a confirmation email at the address we have on file within the next 24 hours. Does everything sound good?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.

Agent: Perfect. And Robert, I just want to say I'm really glad we could work this out and get you taken care of. If you have any issues or questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Thanks again.

Agent: You're very welcome. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
