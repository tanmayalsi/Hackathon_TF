Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. It went up like forty bucks out of nowhere.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing an issue with your bill. I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, 555-0147. Let me pull that up here. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's under James Mitchell.

Agent: (pause) Perfect. I've got you here, James. I'm looking at your account now. I see your most recent bill was issued on the 15th. Is that the one you're calling about?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. My bill was like $79.99 last month, and this month it jumped to almost $120. I never authorized any of that.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me take a closer look at the charges here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing... it looks like you were on our Fiber 200 plan at $79.99, and it looks like on the 10th of this month, the account was upgraded to our Fiber 500 plan, which is $119.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, I didn't upgrade anything. I didn't call anyone about upgrading. Why would that just happen?

Agent: That's a great question, and I apologize for the confusion. Let me check the notes on your account to see if there's any record of how that change was initiated. (pause, typing sounds) Hmm... it looks like the upgrade was processed as a manual change by one of our representatives, but I'm not seeing detailed notes about whether this was done over the phone or online. Do you remember receiving any communication about this before it happened?

Customer: No, nothing. I mean, I get those promotional emails sometimes, but I definitely didn't call in or agree to anything. This is really frustrating because I'm on a tight budget right now.

Agent: I really do apologize for this situation. That shouldn't have happened without your explicit consent. Let me make this right for you. I can go ahead and revert your account back to the Fiber 200 plan, and I can also credit back the difference for this billing cycle.

Customer: Okay, so you'll credit me the $40?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. I'm going to credit you the difference of $40 for this month, and then your bill going forward will be back to $79.99 unless you decide you want to upgrade in the future. Is that... does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that's... yeah, that's good. Thank you. But like, how did this even happen? Who upgraded my account?

Agent: (pause) That's a really fair question. Based on what I'm seeing in the system, it shows it was a manual adjustment, but without more detailed notes, I can't tell you exactly which representative made the change or under what circumstances. What I can tell you is that this shouldn't happen without customer authorization. Would you like me to add a note to your account requesting that no changes be made without calling you first to verify?

Customer: Yeah, actually, can you do that? Because I don't want this happening again.

Agent: (typing sounds) Absolutely. I'm adding that note right now to your account. It says here to contact customer before making any plan changes. That way, if anyone tries to make modifications, they'll see that flag and reach out to you first.

Customer: Okay, good. I appreciate that. Um, one more thing though. I just want to make sure the credit is actually going to show up on my next bill, right?

Agent: Yes, it will definitely show up on your next bill. You should see it as a credit applied to your account. It'll reduce what you owe. Your next bill should be around $79.99 minus the $40 credit, so you'd only owe about $39.99 for that cycle.

Customer: Alright, that sounds good. And my internet speed goes back to normal?

Agent: Your internet speed will go back to the Fiber 200 speeds, which is up to 200 megabits per second. You might notice the change over the next couple hours as the system updates on our end.

Customer: Okay, I think I'm good then. Thanks for taking care of this, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, James. I'm really sorry this happened, but I'm glad we could get it straightened out for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications. We really appreciate your business, and if you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
