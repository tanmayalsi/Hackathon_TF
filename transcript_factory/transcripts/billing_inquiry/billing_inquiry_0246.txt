Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I received my bill this month and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize. It's quite a bit higher than what I've been paying.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's 555-0847. That's the phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. Let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Jennifer Martinez. M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z.

Agent: Perfect, Jennifer. I have your account here. I'm looking at your recent billing. So your most recent bill from this month shows a total of $89.99. Is that the one you're looking at?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. Last month I was paying $59.99, and now it jumped up by thirty dollars. That's... that's a pretty significant increase. I don't understand what happened.

Agent: I completely understand your concern. That is a noticeable jump. Let me take a closer look at what changed. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that you were on our promotional rate of $59.99 per month for your Gigabit Fiber plan, and that promotional period ended last month.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about that. How long was the promotion supposed to last?

Agent: That's a great question. Let me check the details on your account. (typing sounds) So according to what I'm seeing, the promotion was for twelve months, and it looks like you've been with us for... just over a year now. So the promo ended with your last billing cycle.

Customer: But I never got any notification about this. I mean, shouldn't you guys send something, an email or a letter, to let customers know that their rate is going to change?

Agent: You know, that's... that's actually a really fair point, Jennifer. We do send notifications, but I understand sometimes they can get lost or end up in spam folders. Let me just verify—did you receive any communications from us in the past month or two?

Customer: I mean, I get emails from you guys all the time, but I'll admit I don't read all of them. But still, a thirty-dollar jump seems excessive. What am I actually paying for now?

Agent: So you're currently on our Gigabit Fiber plan, which offers speeds up to one gigabit per second. The regular rate for that plan in your area is $89.99 per month. That includes unlimited data and our standard modem rental.

Customer: Okay, but I don't need gigabit speeds. I mean, I'm just doing email, some browsing, maybe streaming Netflix. That's way more than I need. Can I switch to a slower plan?

Agent: Absolutely, we have other options available. We have our 200 megabit plan which is $49.99 a month, and our 400 megabit plan at $69.99 a month. Both would be more than adequate for what you're describing. Would either of those interest you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, the 400 megabit plan sounds fine. But... I mean, is there anything you can do about this month's bill? It seems like I should have been notified better.

Agent: I hear you. Let me see what I can do for you. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, so what I can do is apply a one-time credit of twenty dollars to your account to help offset this unexpected increase. That would bring this month's bill down to $69.99. And then starting next month, once we make the switch to the 400 megabit plan, you'd be at that $69.99 rate going forward.

Customer: So twenty dollars this month, and then it'll be sixty-nine ninety-nine from now on?

Agent: That's correct. The credit will show up on your next bill, and we'll have that plan change effective immediately.

Customer: (pause) Okay, that's... that's better. I appreciate that. Can you make sure I get an email confirmation of this plan change so I have it in writing?

Agent: Absolutely, we'll send that right over to the email address on file. Is that still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yes, that's the one.

Agent: Perfect. So just to recap what we've done here—I've applied a twenty-dollar credit to your current bill, we're downgrading you to the 400 megabit fiber plan at $69.99 per month, and you'll receive an email confirmation of everything we discussed. Does that all sound good?

Customer: Yes, that sounds good. Thank you for working with me on this, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. I really appreciate your patience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks again.

Agent: Great. Thank you so much for choosing Frontier, and we appreciate your business. Have a wonderful day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
