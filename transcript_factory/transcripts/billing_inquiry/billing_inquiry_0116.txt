# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and I'm seeing a charge that wasn't there last month.

Agent: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. My name's David Chen, by the way.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, David, I'm pulling up your account now. (pause) Got it. I see you're on our Fiber 500 plan. What charge are you seeing that concerns you?

Customer: So my bill was usually around eighty-nine ninety-five, right? And this month it's showing as one hundred and twelve dollars. That's... that's almost twenty-five dollars more. I don't remember authorizing any changes or upgrades or anything.

Agent: I understand your frustration, David. Let me take a look at what's on here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that on September 15th, there was a service modification applied to your account. It looks like you were moved from our promotional Fiber 500 plan to the standard rate.

Customer: Wait, wait. What do you mean "promotional plan"? I've been on this plan for like three years. How is that promotional?

Agent: That's a good question. The promotional pricing was originally for twelve months from your installation date, but it appears it was extended. However, it did expire on your account. The standard rate for Fiber 500 in your area is currently one hundred and twelve dollars and ninety-nine cents per month.

Customer: (sighs) That's... nobody told me about this. I didn't get any notification. I would've remembered if I got a letter or something about my rate going up.

Agent: I apologize for that. Let me check here... (typing sounds) It looks like a notification was sent out on August 28th via email. Do you happen to check the email address associated with your account?

Customer: Okay, well, I might not have seen it. Email gets lost sometimes. But the thing is, Marcus, I've been a loyal customer for three years. I pay on time every single month. And Frontier's raising my rate by almost twenty-five percent? That seems kind of aggressive.

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from, David, and I appreciate your loyalty. (pause) What I can do is look into some options for you. Are you happy with the speeds and service you're getting?

Customer: The internet's fine, yeah. No problems there. But I'm just... I'm upset about the price increase without proper warning, you know?

Agent: Absolutely. So let me see what I can do here. (typing sounds) We do have some promotional options available for customers in good standing like yourself. I'm seeing that I can offer you a rate lock program where we'd bring your rate back down to ninety-nine ninety-five for twelve months. How does that sound?

Customer: Okay, so that's still higher than the eighty-nine ninety-five I was paying, but it's better than one-twelve. But why can't I just stay at my original rate?

Agent: I wish I could lock you in at eighty-nine ninety-five, David, truly. Unfortunately, that was a limited-time promotional rate specific to your region at the time of your installation. The pricing has adjusted since then. However, this ninety-nine ninety-five for twelve months is actually a pretty solid rate, and it would save you about a hundred and fifty-six dollars over the next year compared to the standard rate.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I guess that's... I mean, it's something. But what happens after those twelve months?

Agent: That's fair to ask. After twelve months, the rate would adjust to the standard rate at that time, which we can't predict, but we would absolutely notify you in advance. And at that point, you'd be eligible to look at promotional offers again or we could discuss other options.

Customer: Alright. I mean, I'm still not thrilled about the situation, but that sounds better than what I'm looking at now. Can you go ahead and apply that?

Agent: Absolutely, I'll get that set up for you right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm applying the promotional rate of ninety-nine ninety-five to your account, effective immediately. This covers your Fiber 500 service for the next twelve months. You'll see the adjusted rate on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Thank you. I just... I really wish I'd gotten better notice about the original rate increase.

Agent: I completely understand, and I genuinely apologize for that. Is there anything else I can help you with today, David?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: It's my pleasure. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and thank you for calling in today. If you have any questions, you have a great day.

Customer: You too, Marcus. Thanks again.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
