Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill this month and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my bill went up like thirty dollars. That doesn't seem right.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having issues with your bill. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, pulling that up now. Can I also get the name on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's Michael Chen.

Agent: (pause) Alright, Michael, I've got your account here. I can see your most recent bill was issued on March 15th. Is that the one you're looking at?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one. March 15th. So I've been paying, I think, like 79.99 a month for the past year or so for the fiber plan, and now it says 109.99. That's almost a forty dollar increase. And then there's also this random charge for like 19.95 that I don't remember authorizing or anything.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Michael. Let me break this down for you. (typing sounds) So looking at your account, I can see that your promotional rate did expire at the end of February. You were on a 12-month promotional pricing for our Gigabit Fiber plan. That's actually ending, so your rate is going to your standard pricing, which is $109.99 a month.

Customer: Wait, wait. So you guys just... automatically raised my rate without telling me? I didn't get any notice about that.

Agent: That's a great question. We do send notices out about promotional expirations. Let me check the notes here. (pause) It looks like we sent a notice to the email address on file about two weeks before the expiration date. Did you... did you happen to receive that email?

Customer: I get so many emails. I mean, I probably did, but... I don't know, it just feels like a bait and switch, you know? I signed up for that price, and now you're just changing it on me.

Agent: I completely understand how frustrating that is. Unfortunately, promotional pricing does have an end date, and that information is in the terms you agreed to when you signed up. However, what I can do is look at what options are available for you. (typing sounds) Let me see if there are any current promotions I can apply to your account to help reduce that increase a bit.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that would be helpful. But what about this 19.95 charge? What is that?

Agent: Good question. (typing sounds) Let me look at the itemized charges here. Okay, I'm looking at your bill breakdown, and I see... it looks like there's a $19.95 charge for... (pause) it says "Equipment Protection Plan." Did you ever add that to your account?

Customer: No, absolutely not. I don't remember signing up for that at all. That's the kind of thing that just gets added without asking, right?

Agent: Let me check our notes here to see when that was added. (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like this was added on February 28th, and I'm seeing a note that it was added during a service call. Do you remember having a technician out to your home around that time?

Customer: Oh, yeah, now that you mention it, we did have someone come out because we were having some WiFi issues. Did the guy just... add that to my account?

Agent: It looks like that may be what happened. I sincerely apologize for that. That shouldn't have been added without your explicit consent. I'm going to remove that charge from your account right now. (typing sounds) Okay, that's been removed, and I'm also going to credit you back for the charges you've already paid for that, which looks like you've been charged once already, so that's $19.95 back to your account. That should show up within one to two billing cycles.

Customer: Okay, well, that's good at least. What about the rate increase though? Is there anything you can do about that?

Agent: So I'm looking at our current promotions, and unfortunately, we don't have a 12-month promotion available at this moment. However, I do have a 6-month promotion that I can apply to your account. That would bring your rate down to... (typing sounds) $89.99 per month for the next six months, and then it would go back to the standard $109.99 after that.

Customer: So six months and then it goes back up again?

Agent: That's correct, yes. At that point, you'd be at the standard rate unless there's another promotion available at that time, which there very well could be. We do run different promotions throughout the year.

Customer: Ugh, okay. I mean, that's better than nothing, I guess. So that brings me down from 109.99 to 89.99?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. So that's a savings of $20 per month for the next six months. After the promotion ends, you'd be back at $109.99.

Customer: Alright, yeah, let's do that. I mean, I'm still not happy about the whole situation, but at least that helps for now.

Agent: Great, I appreciate your flexibility here, Michael. (typing sounds) Okay, I've applied that promotion to your account. You should see that reflected on your next bill on April 15th. Your new rate will be $89.99. And just to recap, we've also removed that Equipment Protection Plan charge and credited you $19.95 for the charge you already paid.

Customer: Okay. Um, can you also send me an email or something when my promotion is about to expire? I don't want to just wake up one day and my bill goes up another $20.

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to make a note on your account right here requesting that we send you a notification email no less than 30 days before your promotion expires on August 31st. That way you'll have plenty of time to review your options and reach out to us if you have any questions.

Customer: Okay, good. I appreciate that. Is there anything else I should know?

Agent: I don't think so. Just to confirm, everything is set. Your new promotional rate of $89.99 will start on your April bill. You'll get a courtesy notification before that promotion expires, and we'll have removed that unauthorized service from your account. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate your help, Derek.

Agent: My pleasure, Michael. Thank you for choosing Frontier Communications, and if you need anything else in the future, don't hesitate to give us a call.

Customer: Will do. Thanks, bye.

Agent: Bye now.
