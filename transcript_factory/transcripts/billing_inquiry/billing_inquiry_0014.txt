# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, um, yeah. I need to talk to someone about my bill. I just got my latest invoice and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like... way more than I expected.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my service phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here... Okay, I've got your account. I'm seeing it's under the name Jennifer Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great, Jennifer. So you mentioned you're seeing some charges you don't recognize and your bill increased. Let me review your most recent statement. (pause) I'm seeing your bill for this month is $127.99. Can you tell me what you were expecting to pay?

Customer: Well, when I signed up like three years ago, I was paying $79.99 a month for the gigabit plan. Last month it was like $109, and now it's $127. That's almost a fifty dollar difference from when I started. What... what happened?

Agent: I understand your frustration, Jennifer. So what I'm seeing here is that you were on a promotional rate when you first signed up. That promotion expired about... (typing sounds) ...about fourteen months ago. So your rate adjusted to our standard pricing for that plan.

Customer: Wait, nobody told me about this. I mean, I don't remember getting any notice about a rate change. This seems pretty sneaky if you ask me.

Agent: I completely understand how that would be frustrating. Let me check our records to see if we sent out any notifications. (pause) It looks like we did send a notice to the email address on file about ninety days before the change took effect. Did you receive anything like that?

Customer: I... I don't know. I get so many emails. I might have, honestly. But I'm still not happy about it. That's a huge jump. And what's this $19.99 charge I'm seeing? "Professional installation fee"? I didn't have anyone come out.

Agent: Okay, let me look at that. (typing sounds) Hmm, that is odd. I'm showing a professional installation from about two weeks ago. Is it possible someone came out to do maintenance or—

Customer: No. Absolutely not. Nobody came to my house. I'm telling you, that's a charge that shouldn't be there.

Agent: I apologize for that. Let me dig a little deeper into this. (pause, typing) You know what, it does look like there might have been an error. I'm seeing the service order was created, but there's a note here that says "customer not home at time of appointment." So the tech never actually came out, but the charge went through anyway. That's definitely our mistake, and I sincerely apologize for that.

Customer: Okay, so you're saying you charged me for a service that never happened?

Agent: That's exactly what happened, and I'm very sorry. I can absolutely remove that $19.99 charge from your account right away. (typing sounds) Done. That's been credited back to your account, and you should see that reflected on your next bill.

Customer: Okay, well, at least that's something. But I'm still upset about the price increase. Is there anything you can do about that? Like, is there a different plan or something that would be cheaper?

Agent: That's a fair question. (pause) Let me look at what we have available in your area. I see we have a couple of options. We do have our standard fiber plan at 500 megabits per second for $89.99 a month, which would be a decrease from your current rate. The trade-off is you'd be giving up the gigabit speeds. Would that be something you'd be interested in?

Customer: I mean... I use the gigabit plan pretty regularly. I stream a lot and work from home sometimes. Would that be enough?

Agent: For most users, 500 megs is more than sufficient for streaming and work-from-home use. You shouldn't notice much of a difference unless you're downloading very large files frequently. But if you do need that extra speed, I do have another option. We're currently running a promotion where we can get you back into a promo rate on your gigabit plan for twelve months at $99.99 a month, which would represent about a $28 savings from what you're paying now.

Customer: (pause) Really? How did you... why didn't you mention that at the beginning of the call?

Agent: That's... that's a great question, and I apologize. I should have offered that up front. We do run these promotions, and I should have reviewed your account more thoroughly. I'm sorry about that.

Customer: Well, okay. So if I do that, my rate locks in at $99.99 for a year, and then what? It goes back up again?

Agent: That's correct. After the twelve-month promotional period ends, it would revert to our standard rate, which is currently $127.99. However, that would give you a full year, and in the meantime, we can discuss other options if something changes with our pricing.

Customer: Hmm. I guess that's better than paying $127 right now. Yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Excellent. I'm going to apply that promotional rate to your account right now. (typing sounds) Okay, all set. Your new rate of $99.99 will take effect on your next billing cycle, which starts on the 15th of next month. You'll also receive a confirmation email with all the details of this promotion and when it expires.

Customer: And you're also taking off that $19.99, right?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. That charge has already been removed and credited to your account.

Customer: Okay, good. (pause) I appreciate that. I'm sorry for being kind of short earlier, but I was really frustrated when I saw that bill.

Agent: Please don't apologize. Your frustration was completely valid, Jennifer. You had a legitimate billing error, and I'm glad we were able to correct that for you today. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, I think that's everything. Thank you for taking care of this.

Agent: You're very welcome. I just want to make sure you have my name in case you need anything else. It's Derek, D-E-R-E-K. And your reference number for this call is 847-FRT-2024. Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, Jennifer, and we appreciate your business.

Customer: Thanks. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, Jennifer. Take care, and thank you for calling Frontier Communications.
