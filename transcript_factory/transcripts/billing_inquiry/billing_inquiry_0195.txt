Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like thirty bucks from last month. I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having billing concerns. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get a name to verify the account?

Customer: It's Michael Chen. C-H-E-N.

Agent: Perfect, thank you Michael. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account here. So I can see your February bill was $89.99, and your March bill is $119.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yes! That's exactly it. That's a thirty dollar jump right there. And I didn't authorize any changes to my service. I've had the same plan for like two years now.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me look into what may have changed. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that on March 1st, there was an adjustment made to your account. It looks like you were on our Fiber 200 plan, which was $89.99 a month, and you've been upgraded to our Fiber 500 plan at $119.99. Do you remember requesting that upgrade?

Customer: No, I definitely did not request that. I don't know how that happened. Can you just... can you just switch me back?

Agent: Of course. I apologize for the confusion. Before we do that, let me just check your account notes to see if there's any record of... (pause) Hmm, it looks like you may have received a promotional offer in the mail around that time? We had a campaign where existing customers could upgrade to Fiber 500 for an additional $29.99 per month. Do you recall receiving anything like that?

Customer: (skeptical) I mean, I get a lot of mail, but I definitely didn't fill anything out or call anyone about upgrading. Are you saying I was automatically upgraded?

Agent: That shouldn't have happened, and I apologize. Let me check with my supervisor real quick to see... actually, you know what, I'm looking at the notes more carefully here. It says here that there was a service call scheduled for February 28th to upgrade your line equipment. Were you home for that appointment?

Customer: Oh... oh wait. Yeah, I was. The technician did come by. But he just... he was here for like ten minutes. He didn't say anything about upgrading my plan or changing my bill.

Agent: (sighs) I'm really sorry about this, Michael. It appears the technician may have noted an upgrade on the work order, but there should have been explicit consent from you before making any billing changes. This shouldn't have happened without your authorization and a clear explanation of the cost difference.

Customer: So what, it's just my bad luck then?

Agent: No, no, that's not on you at all. This is our mistake. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to credit your account for the full difference—that's the $30 for this month—and I'm going to downgrade you back to the Fiber 200 plan effective immediately. That way, next month you'll see your bill back to $89.99. Does that work for you?

Customer: (pause) Really? You're going to credit it back?

Agent: Absolutely. You didn't authorize this change, and that's on us. I'm processing that credit right now. (typing sounds) And I'm also going to add a courtesy credit of $10 to your account for the inconvenience of having to call in about this. So you should see about a $40 credit total on your next bill.

Customer: Oh, okay. Well, I appreciate that. Um, but I do want to ask—I like the Fiber 200 speed, but is it going to stay at $89.99? Like, am I going to see another random increase?

Agent: That's a fair question. Your rate is locked in at $89.99 for the next twelve months. After that, it could potentially adjust, but you'd receive a notice at least 30 days before any changes. And honestly, based on what just happened, if you ever receive any promotional offers or notice changes to your account, feel free to give us a call right away and we can sort it out together.

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. So just to confirm—I'm going back to Fiber 200, the credit of forty bucks is going on my account, and my rate is locked in for a year?

Agent: That's exactly right. And your new rate will go into effect on your next billing cycle, which looks like it starts on April 5th. You'll see the credit reflected on that bill as well. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that should do it. Thanks for taking care of that, Derek.

Agent: You're very welcome, Michael. I really do apologize again for the mix-up. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
