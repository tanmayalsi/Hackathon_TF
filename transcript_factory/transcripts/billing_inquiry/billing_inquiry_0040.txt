# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and my internet rate went up like thirty dollars a month. I've been a customer for almost five years now, and I'm pretty frustrated about this.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'm sorry you're experiencing that. Let me pull up your account here and see what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's... uh... (pause) ...555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm looking that up now. Got it. I see your account here under the name... is this James Peterson?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so I'm seeing that your bill did increase this month, and I can definitely understand why you'd want to talk about that. Let me look at what happened here. (pause) So it looks like your promotional rate expired. You were on a two-year promotional price of $49.99 a month for our Fiber 100 service, and that promotion ended on March 15th. You've now moved to our standard rate of $79.99.

Customer: See, that's... that's the problem though. I mean, nobody told me about this. I didn't get any notification or anything. I just opened my bill and—boom—thirty-dollar increase.

Agent: I hear you. That's frustrating. We do send out notifications before a promotional rate expires, but let me check what we have on file. (typing sounds) Looking at your account, it shows we sent you a notification... it looks like it was via email on February 28th, alerting you that your promotion would be ending. Do you remember receiving that email?

Customer: No, I don't think so. I mean, maybe it went to spam or something. But still, even if I did get it, I feel like that's... that's not really fair. Five years, Derek. Five years I've been paying, no problems, no missed payments, nothing. And now you guys just raise the price?

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate your loyalty. (pause) So let me see what options I can look at for you here. Um... (typing sounds) Okay, so what I'm seeing is that we do have a current promotion available for existing customers like yourself. We can get you set up on our Fiber 200 service for... let me see... $59.99 a month for twelve months. That would actually give you faster speeds than what you currently have, but at a rate that's lower than the standard Fiber 100 price.

Customer: Hmm. So that's still a ten-dollar increase from what I was paying before.

Agent: Right, so that's a ten-dollar increase versus the thirty that you're currently being charged. The promotion expired, so... I mean, this is kind of the reality of the situation, but I can definitely work with you on this.

Customer: I don't know. How long would I be locked in for?

Agent: Twelve months with that promotion. After that, the rate would move to the standard rate for Fiber 200, which is $84.99 a month. But you'd have the ability to review other options at that time or call back to see if we have any other promotions running.

Customer: What if I want to cancel? I mean, I'm looking at my options here because I know some other providers are offering deals too.

Agent: (pause) I totally understand you're looking around. Let me see... (typing sounds) ...if you cancel right now, we would just need to schedule a technician to come remove the equipment. However, if you stay on the promotional rate I just mentioned, you'd be getting a better speed and a lower price point than your current situation. And I'll be honest with you—our Fiber service in your area is pretty hard to beat compared to cable or satellite options.

Customer: Yeah, I mean, the service itself has been good. I'm not complaining about that. It's just the whole... the lack of communication thing and then getting hit with this bill.

Agent: I really do get it. And I appreciate you saying that about the service. Here's what I can do for you. I can apply that Fiber 200 promotion at $59.99 for twelve months, and I'm also going to apply a one-time $25 bill credit to your account as a gesture of goodwill for your five years of loyalty. That way, your next bill will be reduced by that $25.

Customer: (pause) Okay, so that would make the first month like... what, thirty-five dollars?

Agent: Exactly. That's right. $59.99 minus the $25 credit.

Customer: (pause) ...Yeah, okay. I can work with that. But I'm gonna hold you guys to it. If anything changes or if there's any issue, I'm switching providers.

Agent: Fair enough. I completely understand. So let me get this set up for you here. (typing sounds) I'm updating your account now. I'm adding you to the Fiber 200 promotional tier at $59.99 per month for a twelve-month period, and I'm applying that $25 bill credit. This will take effect immediately, so you should see it reflected on your next billing cycle, which would be around April 15th.

Customer: Okay. Is there anything else I need to do on my end?

Agent: Nope, that's all taken care of. You don't need to do anything. Your current equipment is compatible with the faster speed, so there's no technician visit needed or anything like that. The speed upgrade should kick in automatically within the next 24 hours. You might want to do a power cycle on your modem just to be safe—unplug it for about 30 seconds and plug it back in—but it's not required.

Customer: Yeah, I can do that. Um, is there a way I can get that email notification thing set up differently? Like, maybe a phone call or something? Because I really don't trust my email.

Agent: That's a great question. You know, we can definitely add a phone number to your account for important notifications like this. Let me add that for you. What phone number would you like us to use? Is it the same number on the account, or would you prefer a different one?

Customer: Uh, you can use my cell phone. It's 555-0291.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect. I'm adding that to your account right now. You'll start receiving important notifications via text message to that number going forward.

Customer: Great. Alright, well, thank you for working with me on this, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: My pleasure. And again, I apologize for the frustration with the rate increase and the notification. I know that's not ideal. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for being such a loyal Frontier customer, James. We really do appreciate it. Your confirmation number for this change is 447829. We'll send that to you via email as well. If you need anything else in the future, don't hesitate to give us a call back.

Customer: Will do. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye.
