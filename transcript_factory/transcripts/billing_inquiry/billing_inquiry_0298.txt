# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi Derek. I'm calling because I received my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my monthly bill went up significantly. I need to understand what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account. Can I get your phone number or account number, please?

Customer: It's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. And can I verify the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Morrison.

Agent: (pause) Perfect, I've got you here, Mr. Morrison. I'm looking at your account now. I can see your most recent bill. What specific charge were you concerned about?

Customer: Well, for starters, my bill jumped from $89.99 to $119.99. That's thirty bucks more a month. I've been a customer for... geez, I don't know, five or six years now? And I've never had this kind of jump before. What happened?

Agent: I understand your concern. That is a noticeable increase. Let me take a look at what might have changed on your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that your promotional rate expired. You were on our Fiber 500 plan with a one-year promotion that ended last month.

Customer: A promotion? I didn't... I mean, nobody told me this was going to happen. I should have gotten a notice or something.

Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize if you didn't receive notification. We typically send those out about 30 days prior to the rate change. It looks like... (pause) yes, you should have received a notice around the first week of November. Did you happen to see anything like that?

Customer: I might have, honestly. I get a ton of mail. So you're telling me this is just... what, the new rate? There's nothing I can do about it?

Agent: Well, not necessarily. Let me look at what options might be available to you. You've been a great customer for over five years, so let me see what I can do. (typing sounds) Okay, so your current plan is our Fiber 500 at the standard rate of $119.99. I do see that we have a current promotion running for new customers, but that wouldn't apply to existing accounts. However, I do have some flexibility here.

Customer: Okay, so... what are you saying?

Agent: Let me ask you a few questions first. Are you happy with the Fiber 500 speeds? Would you ever consider adjusting your service level?

Customer: I mean, it's fine. The internet works great, honestly. I don't really need anything faster. I'm just not happy about paying thirty more dollars for the same thing.

Agent: Right, that makes sense. Well, I have a couple of options for you. One thing I can do is apply a loyalty discount to bring your rate down. It wouldn't get you back to $89.99, but I could potentially bring you to around $104.99 for the next 12 months. That would save you about $15 a month.

Customer: (pause) So I'm still paying more than before?

Agent: Unfortunately, yes. The promotional pricing you had was a special introductory offer, and the standard market rate is higher. However, the loyalty discount would help offset some of that increase. Alternatively, if you were open to it, we could look at our Fiber 300 plan, which runs at $94.99, and you'd actually be saving $5 compared to your current bill—

Customer: But that's slower internet, right?

Agent: Yes, it would be 300 megabits per second instead of 500, but for most household uses—streaming, browsing, video calls—it's more than adequate. Studies show most households don't even utilize 500 megs.

Customer: I don't know... I like having the faster speed. It's worth something to me, you know? And honestly, Derek, I'm frustrated because I feel like the company just... let my rate jump without any real attempt to keep my business.

Agent: I hear you, and I appreciate your honesty. (pause) Let me do this for you. I'm going to apply the loyalty discount, which brings you to $104.99, and I'm also going to extend that rate for 18 months instead of 12. That's an extra six months of stability. And I'm going to waive your DVR rental fee for the next three months as a gesture of goodwill. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) The DVR fee waive—how much is that?

Agent: That's $9.99 a month, so about $30 over the three months.

Customer: Okay, so I'd be at $104.99 for a year and a half, and I save the DVR fee for three months. That's... that's better than $119.99, I guess. But I still don't love it.

Agent: I completely understand. This is the best I can offer you without you moving to a lower-tier service. But I want to be transparent—when this 18-month period ends, your rate will go back to standard pricing unless another promotion becomes available. I'd recommend setting a reminder to call back around that time so we can look at your options before any automatic rate increase.

Customer: Yeah, okay. So you'll make those changes right now? The loyalty discount and the DVR waiver?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm applying those to your account as we speak. (typing sounds) Okay, I've got it all set up. Let me just confirm the details. You'll see the new rate of $104.99 reflected on your next billing cycle, which should be... (pause) December 15th. And the DVR fee waiver is active for the next three months. Your promotional period is set to expire on April 15th of next year.

Customer: Got it. And I should call back before April if I want to avoid another increase?

Agent: Exactly right. You've got it. I'll also make a note on your account recommending you contact us for retention offers about 30 days before that expiration. That way, we can be proactive about finding you the best rate available at that time.

Customer: Alright, Derek. I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm not thrilled about paying more overall, but this is better than I expected.

Agent: I'm glad I could help, Mr. Morrison. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for taking the time.

Agent: Thank you for being such a loyal Frontier customer. We really do appreciate your business. You have a great day, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
