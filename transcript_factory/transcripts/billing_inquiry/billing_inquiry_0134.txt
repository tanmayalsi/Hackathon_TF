Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my account and I'm seeing a charge that wasn't there last month, and honestly, I'm pretty frustrated about it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. My name is Patricia Valdez.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Patricia, let me pull that up for you here... and I'm seeing your account. So you mentioned there's a charge you're not recognizing? Let me take a look at your recent billing activity.

Customer: Yes, so on my bill this month, it's showing $89.99, and last month it was $79.99. That's a ten-dollar increase, and nobody told me anything about that. I've been with Frontier for like three years now and my rate's always been the same.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I see what you're looking at. So your bill did go up by ten dollars. Let me just... (typing sounds) pull up your service details here to see what might have changed. Do you remember approximately when you signed up with us?

Customer: It was early 2021. And like I said, I haven't changed anything on my account. I still have the same internet plan, the same speed, everything. So why would my bill suddenly jump?

Agent: That's a fair question. I completely understand your concern. So looking at your account here, I'm seeing that you're on our Fiber 200 plan, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Okay, so I'm checking the notes here, and it looks like... (pause) it appears your promotional pricing period has ended. When you signed up in 2021, you were on a promotional rate of $79.99 per month, and that promotion was a twelve-month offer. That ended about a month ago, so your rate has adjusted to our standard pricing, which is $89.99.

Customer: (frustrated) Well, that's just great. So you're telling me that three years later, my bill goes up and I'm just supposed to be okay with that? I didn't get any notification about this. There was nothing in the mail, nothing in my email—

Agent: I understand, and I apologize that you didn't receive a clear notification about the rate change. That should have been communicated to you better. Let me see what I can do to help here. (typing sounds) Okay, so we do have some options available. First, let me check if there are any current promotions that I can apply to your account to help bring that cost down.

Customer: (pause) Okay... yes, please do that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Hold on one second while I check our current promotional offerings... (pause) Alright, so I'm showing that we do have a promotion available for existing customers on your plan. We can offer you the Fiber 200 plan at $69.99 for the next twelve months. That's actually lower than what you were paying originally.

Customer: Oh... really? (pause) Well, that's... that's actually better. How long does that last?

Agent: So that promotion is good for twelve months, and after that, your rate would go back to standard pricing, which would be the $89.99 that we discussed. But you would get a notification at least thirty days before that happens, and at that time, we could look at other options available to you.

Customer: Okay, so let me make sure I understand this correctly. You're saying I can get it down to $69.99 for a year, and then it goes back up to $89.99?

Agent: That's correct. And just to be transparent, I want to make sure you know that after that year is up, you're welcome to call back and we can see if there are other promotions available at that time. We always have options for loyal customers like yourself.

Customer: (pause) Well, I appreciate that. I mean, I'm still not thrilled about being charged the higher rate without a heads up, but... (pause) this helps. Can you go ahead and apply that?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to apply that promotion to your account right now. (typing sounds) Just give me a couple of seconds here... (pause) Okay, and that's all set. Your promotional rate of $69.99 has been applied. You should see that reflected on your next billing cycle, which would be... (typing sounds) the 15th of next month.

Customer: Great. And you'll send me a notification before it changes again?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. You'll receive an email and a letter in the mail at least thirty days before your promotion ends, so you'll have plenty of time to reach out to us if you want to discuss other options. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thank you for taking care of that. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're very welcome, Patricia. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. If you need anything else, please don't hesitate to give us a call. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Goodbye.
