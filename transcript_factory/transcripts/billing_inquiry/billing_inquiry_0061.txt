Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and also my rate went up. I've been a customer for like... three years now, and I'm pretty frustrated.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. One moment, please.

Customer: Sure.

Agent: (pause) Alright, I've got your account here. I see you're on our Frontier Fiber 300 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's the one.

Agent: Perfect. So, you mentioned a rate increase and an unfamiliar charge. Let me start by asking... when did you first notice the charge?

Customer: It's on this month's bill. The bill came yesterday. I'm looking at it right now, actually. There's a charge here for like $12.99 for something called "premium DNS protection" or something? I didn't sign up for that.

Agent: (typing) Okay, let me see if I can locate that for you. (pause) Hmm, give me just one second. I'm looking at your account here, and I do see that charge was added to your account about... it looks like about two weeks ago. Do you remember receiving any emails or communications about that?

Customer: No, nothing. I mean, I check my email pretty regularly, so I would've seen it. Nothing at all.

Agent: I apologize for that. It's possible that it was added without proper notification, and that's something I can definitely help correct. Before we get to that, can you also tell me what the rate increase is? What are you seeing on the bill?

Customer: Well, my internet was $79.99 a month, and now it's showing $89.99. That's ten dollars more. And then with this DNS thing, it's basically eleven dollars more than what I was paying.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so you're looking at a ten-dollar increase on the base service, plus the $12.99 charge. I see here on my end that you actually... let me check the promotion history. (pause) So it looks like you were on an introductory rate when you first signed up, and that introductory period has expired. The original promotional rate was $79.99 for the first twelve months, and you're now moving into the standard rate of $89.99. Did you receive any notice about that?

Customer: I... I don't think so? I mean, maybe I got something in the mail, but I don't remember seeing anything.

Agent: I understand. We should have sent out a notice approximately thirty days before the rate change took effect. I apologize if that didn't reach you or wasn't clear. However, that is a standard promotional rate that does expire. The good news is that I can work with you on that. But first, let me take care of this premium DNS protection charge, because that one definitely needs to be removed from your account.

Customer: Wait, what do you mean you can work with me on the rate? Like, can you bring it back down?

Agent: Let me look at what options we have available. (typing sounds) Okay, so we do have some promotions currently available. Since you've been a loyal customer for three years, I can potentially offer you a new promotional rate. But let me first remove this DNS charge, and then we can discuss that. Sound good?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Yeah, remove that charge.

Agent: Perfect. (typing) I'm going to remove the premium DNS protection charge from your account effective immediately. You should not see that on your next billing cycle. I'm also going to apply a credit of $12.99 to your account for this month, so you will see that reflected on your next bill. Can I confirm your email address is still [inaudible]@gmail.com?

Customer: Yeah, that's right.

Agent: Great. You should receive a confirmation email within the next hour about the credit and the removal of that service. Now, regarding the rate increase. We currently have a promotion where I can lock you in at $84.99 per month for twelve months. That would be a five-dollar savings compared to the standard rate, and a five-dollar increase from your original promotional rate. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) So I'm paying five more than I was before?

Agent: That's correct. Your original promotional rate was $79.99, and this new rate would be $84.99. However, after the twelve months, it would go back to the standard rate of $89.99 unless we have another promotion available at that time.

Customer: Hmm. I mean... I don't love it, but I guess that's better than paying ninety bucks, right? Can you do any better than that?

Agent: (pause) Let me check what else I have available here. (typing sounds) Actually, you know what, I'm going to see if I can get you locked in at $82.99 for fourteen months instead. That's a three-dollar increase from your original rate, but you get the benefit of keeping that rate for fourteen months instead of twelve. Let me just verify that with my supervisor real quick. Can you hold for just a moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure. No problem.

Agent: Thank you. (hold music, pause of about thirty seconds)

Agent: Okay, I'm back. Great news. I was able to approve $82.99 for fourteen months. So you're looking at a three-dollar increase, but you have peace of mind knowing that rate is locked in for over a year. Does that work better for you?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, actually, that's pretty reasonable. Okay, yeah, let's do that.

Agent: Excellent. I'm going to apply that to your account right now. (typing sounds) Perfect. So to recap everything we've done today: I've removed the premium DNS protection charge, applied a $12.99 credit to your account, and locked you into a new promotional rate of $82.99 per month for fourteen months. That new rate is effective starting with your next billing cycle, which should be... (pause) on the 15th of next month.

Customer: Great. And I'll get something in the mail confirming all this, or...?

Agent: You should receive an email confirmation within the hour with all the details of the changes. If you don't receive it, you can always log into your account online or give us a call back. But you should definitely see it. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I appreciate your help, Derek.

Agent: My pleasure! I really do apologize for the confusion with the DNS charge and the rate increase notice. We appreciate your business, and thanks for sticking with Frontier Communications. You have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
