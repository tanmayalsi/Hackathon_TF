Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I don't know, something doesn't seem right. My internet bill just went up like thirty dollars. I wasn't expecting that at all.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're seeing an unexpected increase. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my home phone number too, actually.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, let me pull that up here. One second... Okay, I'm looking at the account for Michael Torres at 1428 Maple Street, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Great. So you're saying your bill increased by about thirty dollars? Let me see what's on here... (pause) Okay, I'm looking at your current bill. Can you tell me what you were paying before?

Customer: It was like... sixty-nine ninety-five. And now it's showing ninety-nine ninety-five. That's like a forty dollar jump, actually. I'm not happy about it.

Agent: Yeah, I can understand your frustration. Let me look at the billing history here to see what changed. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing... it looks like your promotional rate expired last month. You had a two-year promotional offer that was ending, and your rate adjusted to our standard pricing for the Frontier Fiber 500 plan.

Customer: Promotional rate? I don't remember signing up for any promotional rate. And nobody called me to tell me it was going to expire or anything.

Agent: I understand. Let me check your account notes here... (pause) Okay, so looking back, it looks like you signed up for the plan... just over two years ago in January of 2022. The promotional pricing was active for the first 24 months, which would have ended in January of this year. So the adjustment would have started on your February bill.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me my bill went up in February and I'm just now... I mean, I didn't really pay attention. But why didn't anyone tell me? Don't you guys send out notifications or anything?

Agent: That's a good question. We do send out notifications, typically about 30 days before a promotional rate expires. Let me see if there's any record of that being sent to you. (typing sounds) Okay, so according to my notes, a notification was sent to the email address on file—that's... michael.torres87@email.com. Is that still a current email address?

Customer: Oh, um... well, I don't really check that email much. I mean, that's my old work email. I probably don't get things to it anymore. But like, couldn't you have called me instead? I gave you my phone number.

Agent: That's definitely fair feedback. While we typically rely on email notifications, I totally understand that not everyone monitors those regularly. (pause) So let me just walk you through what's happening here. Your promotional rate was two years at $69.95 per month for the Fiber 500 plan, which includes download speeds up to 500 Mbps. Your new standard rate is $99.95 per month for the same service.

Customer: But that's crazy. That's a forty dollar difference. Do you have anything else I could switch to that's cheaper?

Agent: Well, let me see what options are available to you. (typing sounds) Okay, so we have our Fiber 300 plan, which would be $79.95 per month. That gives you up to 300 Mbps downloads. Are you actually using the speeds from the 500 plan, or would a lower speed tier work for you?

Customer: I mean... I don't really know what I use. I just watch Netflix, do some email, occasionally work from home. I don't think I need the super-fast speeds, honestly.

Agent: Okay, so for what you're describing, the Fiber 300 plan would probably be more than sufficient. That would bring your bill down to $79.95, so you'd still be paying about ten dollars more than your original promotional rate, but it's a good compromise. However, I actually have something better for you.

Customer: Oh yeah? What's that?

Agent: Well, since you've been a loyal customer for over two years, and you weren't given adequate notice before your rate adjustment, I can actually apply a loyalty promotion to your account. I can put you back on a promotional rate for another year—$69.95 per month for the Fiber 500 plan. That gets you back to what you were paying.

Customer: (pause) Really? You can do that?

Agent: Yes, I can. It's completely at my discretion as a customer service representative, and given the circumstances, I think it's the right thing to do. You've been a good customer.

Customer: Wow, okay. Yeah, that would be... that would actually be great. So I'd go back to sixty-nine ninety-five?

Agent: Exactly. Your bill for next month would be $69.95 for the Fiber 500 plan. Now, I want to be transparent with you—this promotional rate is good for 12 months. After that, it will adjust again, and I'd recommend setting a reminder or updating your email address so you don't miss the notification next time.

Customer: (chuckles) Yeah, okay. I'll update my email. Can I give you a different email?

Agent: Of course. What's a better email for you?

Customer: It's michael.torres.mtorres@gmail.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, michael.torres.mtorres@gmail.com. Got it. I'm updating that on your account right now. (pause) Okay, that's all set. So to recap—I've applied a 12-month promotional rate to your account. Your monthly charge will be $69.95 starting with your next billing cycle. You should see the adjustment reflected on your next bill, which would be next month.

Customer: That's perfect. Thank you, Derek. I really appreciate that.

Agent: You're welcome. And I'm sorry we didn't reach out to you better before that first rate change. I'm going to make a note on your account that we updated your email, so if there are any future changes, you'll get the notification at your new address.

Customer: I appreciate that.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's all. That was it.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for calling Frontier Communications, and thank you for being a loyal customer. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
