Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm seeing a charge that I don't think should be there. My internet bill basically doubled.

Agent: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account so we can take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and just to confirm, is this for the service at 2841 Maple Drive?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Perfect. I'm looking at your account now. So I can see your previous bill was $79.99 a month, and your current bill is showing $119.99. Is that the increase you're seeing?

Customer: Yeah, exactly. That's a forty-dollar jump. I mean, I've been a customer for like three years now, and my rate's never changed. What happened? Did you guys raise your rates or something?

Agent: (pause) I understand your frustration. Let me see here... (typing sounds) Okay, so looking at your account history, I can see that you were on what we call a promotional rate when you first signed up three years ago. That promotional period was for 24 months, and it looks like that promotion expired about two months ago.

Customer: Wait, so nobody told me about this? Like, I should've gotten a notice or something, right?

Agent: You know, that's a great question. Let me check what notifications were sent out. (typing sounds) It looks like we did send an email notification about 30 days before the change took effect, but I can see here that the email address on file might be... um, it shows [inaudible]... is that still the email you're using?

Customer: No, actually, I haven't used that email in years. I changed it like a year ago. I never got anything.

Agent: Ah, okay, well that explains it then. I apologize for that. Unfortunately, the email address wasn't updated in our system, so you didn't receive the notification. I really do apologize for that oversight.

Customer: So what am I supposed to do? I can't afford to pay that much. I was perfectly happy with the seventy-nine ninety-nine.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what options I have available for you. (typing sounds) Okay, so here's what I can do. Since you didn't receive the proper notification due to the outdated email on your account, I can apply a courtesy credit to your current bill. I can also see if we have any current promotions that might bring your rate down.

Customer: How much of a credit are we talking about?

Agent: Well, typically in a situation like this, I can offer a one-time credit of about half the difference. So that would be twenty dollars off your current bill. And then moving forward, I want to look at some of our current packages. Are you still on our Fiber 200 plan?

Customer: I think so? I have the gigabit speed or whatever. It's the fast one.

Agent: Okay, so you're on Fiber Gig. That's our top speed. (pause) So honestly, your new rate of $119.99 is actually pretty competitive for that service level. However, we do have a new promotion running right now for existing customers. I can get you locked in at $99.99 a month for the next 12 months.

Customer: Oh, really? Okay, well that's better. That's still higher than what I was paying before, but... is that the best you can do?

Agent: Let me see here. (typing sounds) I have one other option. If you'd be willing to bundle with our phone service, I can get you down to $94.99 for the internet, and the phone service would be an additional $29.99, so your total would be around $124.98. But I know that's not necessarily cheaper than just the internet alone.

Customer: No, I don't need phone service. The $99.99 sounds okay, I guess. Can you do that?

Agent: Absolutely. I can lock that in for you right now. Let me just apply that promotional rate to your account. (typing sounds) And I'll also be applying that $20 courtesy credit to your bill this month to help offset some of the increase. So your current bill would be $99.99 instead of $119.99.

Customer: Okay, that's fair. But I gotta ask—can you update my email in the system so this doesn't happen again?

Agent: Absolutely, yes. What email address would you like on file?

Customer: It's jennifer.torres2019@gmail.com.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, got it. Jennifer... torres... 2019 at gmail dot com. Perfect. So just to recap everything: I've applied a 12-month promotional rate of $99.99 per month to your Fiber Gig service, I've credited $20 to your current bill, and I've updated your email address so you'll receive any future notifications about your account.

Customer: Great. So when does the $99.99 rate start?

Agent: It starts with your next billing cycle. So you'll see that reflected on your next bill. Your current bill will show the $20 credit, so it'll be lower than usual. And then going forward, it'll be $99.99 until the promotion expires in 12 months.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. That's much better.

Agent: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks for taking care of that.

Agent: You're very welcome. I'm really sorry again for the confusion with the email notification. We appreciate your three years of business with Frontier, and we hope to keep serving you for many more years to come. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
