Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually, I do recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it, and it's way higher than what I was paying before.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account, please?

Customer: It's James Martinez.

Agent: Perfect, James. I'm looking at your account now. So you're saying there's a charge that's higher than expected?

Customer: Yeah, so I've been paying like, I think it was $89 a month for the Fiber 200 plan, right? And this bill came through and now it's showing $119. That's a $30 increase out of nowhere. Did you guys raise the rates or something?

Agent: (pause) Let me just take a look at your account history here... Okay, so I'm seeing that you're currently on the Fiber 200 plan. Can you tell me... do you remember when you signed up for that plan?

Customer: Uh, I want to say about two years ago? Maybe a little longer. I've been pretty happy with it, so I haven't really paid attention to the details.

Agent: Okay, so that would have been back in 2022. And the reason I'm asking is because I'm looking at your account, and it looks like you were on a promotional rate. So when you originally signed up, you got a discounted price, and that promotional period was for 12 months.

Customer: Oh... okay. So what, the promotion ended?

Agent: (pause) Well, that's... yes and no. I'm actually seeing something a little unusual here. (typing sounds) Your promotional period should have ended about a year ago, so I'm not entirely sure why you've been charged the promotional rate for this long. But looking at your most recent billing cycle, it appears the system has now switched you to our standard rate for that plan, which is $119.99 per month.

Customer: So you're telling me I've been getting a deal for the past year and nobody told me it was going to end?

Agent: I understand your frustration, James. And you're right—we should have sent you a notification before the rate change took effect. Let me see what options I have here... (typing sounds) The standard rate for Fiber 200 is, like I said, $119.99. However, I can look into what current promotions we have available for existing customers.

Customer: What kind of promotions? Because $119 is pretty steep. That's almost 35% more than what I was paying.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me check what I can do for you here. (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing that we do have a loyalty promotion available for customers in your area. I could get you back down to $99 a month for the next 12 months with the Fiber 200 plan. How does that sound?

Customer: So that's still higher than the $89 I was paying, but it's better than $119. But I guess my question is—what happens after the 12 months? Am I going to wake up one day and suddenly get charged $119 again?

Agent: That's a great question. So after this 12-month promotional period ends, you would go to the standard rate unless we have another promotion available at that time. The difference between now and what happened before is that we'll make sure to send you a notification 30 days before your rate changes. You'll get an email and a notice in the mail.

Customer: Okay, so you're guaranteeing that?

Agent: Absolutely. That's our policy for all rate changes going forward. And honestly, James, if you're concerned about it, you can always call us back a month or two before the promotion ends and we can see what options are available at that time.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay. I mean, that's fair. But I still feel like I should have been notified about the first change. Is there anything you can do about that?

Agent: You know what, let me talk to my supervisor about that. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: (hold music plays for approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Okay, James, I'm back. So I talked with my supervisor, and because this was an oversight on our part—we should have sent you a notification before your promotion ended—I'm going to apply a one-time bill credit to your account for the difference between what you were charged and what the current promotional rate is. That's going to be about $30, which should cover this month's overage.

Customer: Really? Oh, wow. Okay, that's... that's actually really helpful. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. So just to recap what we've done: I've applied the $30 credit to your account, which you'll see on your next bill. And I've enrolled you in the promotional rate of $99 per month for the next 12 months. You'll get a confirmation email with all of this information within the next hour or so.

Customer: Got it. And just to confirm—the 99 is locked in for 12 months?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. Twelve months at $99.99 for the Fiber 200 plan. And like I mentioned, you'll get a notification before any changes happen after that.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that. Is there anything else I need to do on my end?

Agent: No, you're all set. We'll take care of everything here. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for working with me on this.

Agent: My pleasure, James. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and we appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
