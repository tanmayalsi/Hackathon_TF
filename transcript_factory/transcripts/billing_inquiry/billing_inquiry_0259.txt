Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on there that I don't recognize. It went up like... a lot, and I need to figure out what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having an issue with your bill. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my phone number on the account.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here. And can I verify the address on the account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 2341 Maple Drive, Apartment 3B.

Agent: Perfect. I've got your account here. I'm seeing your bill from last month. So, you mentioned the charge went up quite a bit. Can you tell me what amount you were expecting versus what you're seeing?

Customer: Well, last month I paid like $79.99, which was fine. This month it's showing $129.99. That's fifty bucks more! I didn't authorize any changes or anything. Did you guys raise the price?

Agent: I understand your frustration. That is a significant increase. Let me take a look at what's on your account. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing here that your promotional rate expired. You were on our intro rate for the first twelve months, which was $79.99 for our Gig fiber package. That promotion ended, so your rate adjusted to the standard pricing, which is $129.99 per month.

Customer: Wait, wait, wait. Nobody told me anything about this. I didn't know the promo was going to end. This is the first I'm hearing about it.

Agent: I understand. Let me check the notes on your account. (pause) So I do see that we sent you a notification... it looks like it went out about thirty days before the change took effect. It would have been sent to the email address on file or possibly as a paper notice. Did you receive anything like that?

Customer: I... maybe? I don't know, I get so much mail and email. But that's not really the point. I mean, couldn't you guys have called me or something? Or at least made it more obvious? This is really unfair. I've been a customer for over a year now, and you're just going to jack up my bill like that?

Agent: I completely hear you. And I appreciate your loyalty as a customer. This is definitely frustrating, and I want to see what I can do to help. (pause) Let me look at what options we have available for you.

Customer: Okay, because I'm not paying $130 a month. That's ridiculous. I could probably get cable internet somewhere else for less than that.

Agent: (typing sounds) Well, I'd hate to see you go. Let me see... (pause) So I can offer you a few different options. I can put you back on a promotional rate for another twelve months at $89.99 per month. That's a $40 discount off the standard rate, and it's actually a bit better than your original promotional rate.

Customer: Hmm. That's better than $129.99, but I still don't like that it's going up from what I was paying before.

Agent: I completely understand. Unfortunately, once a promotional period ends, we do have to transition customers to standard pricing. But that $89.99 rate I'm offering you is actually one of our best rates, and it would lock you in for another year, so you won't see any increases during that time.

Customer: (pause) So I'd be locked in at $89.99 for the next year?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. For the next twelve months, your rate would not increase.

Customer: ...And after that? What happens then?

Agent: After that year, you know, we'd definitely sit down and look at options with you before anything changes. But I can't promise what rates might be available at that time. What I can tell you is that our standard rate is $129.99, and we do offer promotional rates to customers who have been with us for a while.

Customer: Okay. Well, I guess $89.99 is better than $129.99. But I want this all in writing or something, so there's no confusion next year.

Agent: Absolutely. I'll make a note on your account right now, and we'll send you a confirmation email with all the details of this promotion. You'll also receive a paper notice in the mail within 3 to 5 business days. It'll have the exact terms, the rate, and the start and end dates of the promotion.

Customer: Okay, good. And just to be clear, there's nothing else changing, right? Same internet speed, same everything?

Agent: (typing sounds) That's right. Nothing changes except the rate. You're still on our Gig fiber package with gigabit speeds. Everything else stays the same.

Customer: Alright. And when does this new rate kick in?

Agent: (pause) It will take effect on your next billing cycle. So your next bill should reflect the $89.99 rate. And we'll credit back the difference from this month's overage to your account, so you won't be charged that $129.99 after all.

Customer: Oh! Okay, well, that's good to know. Alright, so I'll see that on my next bill then?

Agent: Yes, you should see the credit applied, and then moving forward it'll be $89.99 per month. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome. And again, I'm sorry for the confusion about the promotional period ending. We really do value you as a customer, and we want to make sure you're getting the best rate possible. Is there anything else?

Customer: No, that's it. Thank you.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye!
