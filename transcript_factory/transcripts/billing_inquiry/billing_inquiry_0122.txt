Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually, I recognize it, but it shouldn't be there, and I need to figure out what's going on.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Perfect, David. I'm just loading your account now. (pause) Alright, I've got you here. You mentioned there's a charge you don't recognize. What is it that you're seeing on your bill?

Customer: So my internet service is normally $79.99 a month, which I've been paying for like two years now. But this month it jumped to $119.99. That's a forty-dollar increase! I didn't authorize any changes to my account, and nobody called me about this.

Agent: I understand your frustration, David. Let me take a look at what changed here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm pulling up your service details... It looks like your promotional rate expired.

Customer: What do you mean it expired? I was never told about any promotion. I thought that was my regular rate.

Agent: (pause) Yeah, I can see where that would be confusing. So it looks like when you signed up two years ago, you were enrolled in a two-year promotional pricing plan. That plan included the $79.99 rate for internet service. That promotion ended at the end of last month, so your rate automatically adjusted to our standard rate of $119.99 per month.

Customer: Well, that doesn't make sense. Why would you guys charge me a promotional rate for two years and then just jack it up without telling me? That's not fair. I should have gotten some kind of notice.

Agent: That's a fair point, David. You should have received a notification about the rate change. Let me check if we sent anything out... (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like we did send out a letter about thirty days before the promotion ended. It would have been sent to the address on file, which is... 2847 Maple Street?

Customer: Yeah, that's right, but I never got anything. I mean, I get bills just fine, so I'm not sure why I wouldn't get that letter. This is the first I'm hearing about this.

Agent: I'm sorry about that. It's possible it got lost in the mail. I completely understand your frustration. Let me see what I can do for you here. (pause, typing sounds) So what I can do is I can apply a courtesy credit back to your account for the difference—that's the forty dollars—for this month. And then moving forward, I can also look into putting you on a new promotional rate to bring that price back down.

Customer: Okay, so you'll credit me back the forty dollars?

Agent: That's correct. I'll apply that right now. And then in terms of going forward, I can put you on our current promotional rate, which is... (typing sounds) ...eighty-nine ninety-nine for twelve months.

Customer: So it'll go from $119.99 down to $89.99?

Agent: Actually, it'll be $89.99, which is ten dollars more than your original rate was. But that's locked in for the next twelve months, and you'll get a notification before that promotion ends as well.

Customer: (pause) So I'll be paying ten dollars more than I was before, but at least it's less than the $119.99?

Agent: That's right. And I do apologize for the confusion with the first promotion. We should have communicated that expiration better.

Customer: (sigh) I mean, I guess that works. How long does it take for that credit to show up?

Agent: The credit should process within one to two billing cycles, so you'll see it on your next bill or the one after that. And the new promotional rate will start on your next billing cycle, which would be... (typing sounds) ...the 15th of next month.

Customer: Alright. And you said I'll get notified before that promotion ends this time?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. We'll send you a notice at least thirty days before the end of the promotional period so you're not caught off guard again.

Customer: Okay. Well, I appreciate you taking care of this, Marcus. I was pretty upset when I saw that charge.

Agent: I completely understand, David. I'm sorry you had to experience that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
