Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. Um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually, I recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it to be this much.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Sure, it's area code 503, 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling that up now. And just to confirm, I'm looking for... is this under the name Sarah Mitchell?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect, Sarah. I've got your account here. So you mentioned there's a charge you weren't expecting. Can you tell me which charge that is, or do you have your bill in front of you?

Customer: Yeah, I've got it right here. Okay, so my bill this month is $127.99, but last month it was $89.99. That's like a $38 increase out of nowhere. I haven't added any services or anything.

Agent: (pause) Okay, I see that. Let me take a look at what might have changed on your account. (typing sounds) So I'm seeing here that you were on our Frontier Fiber Starter plan, which was $79.99 a month, and it looks like... (pause) ...that promotional rate expired on March 31st. So as of April 1st, your account was moved to the regular pricing for that plan, which is $99.99 a month.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about a promotional rate expiring. I've been a customer for like... I don't know, almost two years now.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Sarah. Let me check the notes on your account. (typing sounds) Okay, so when you signed up in May of 2022, you were enrolled in a 12-month promotional rate. That would have ended in May of 2023. But it looks like the system automatically extended you on a month-to-month basis at the promotional rate. However, that extension just ended on March 31st.

Customer: So you're telling me that I was getting a deal for like... what, almost two years? And now it just stops?

Agent: I apologize for the confusion. It does appear that the promotion should have ended sooner, but yes, it was extended. The good news is we have some options available to you. I can definitely help you here. What kind of internet speeds are you currently getting with your Starter plan?

Customer: Honestly, I don't really pay attention. It's fine for what I use it for. I just... I don't want to pay over $100 a month for internet. That seems excessive.

Agent: I completely understand. Well, the Starter plan at the regular rate is $99.99, which is where you are now. But I do have some promotional offers I can apply to your account. We actually have a special running right now where I can move you to our Frontier Fiber Standard plan—that's a step up with faster speeds, 200 megabits per second instead of the 100 you have now—and I can offer you that at $79.99 for the next 12 months.

Customer: (pause) So it's the same price as what I was paying before, but with faster internet?

Agent: Exactly. And it's locked in for 12 months, so you won't have any surprises when that promotion ends. You'll get an advance notice and we can discuss options with you before anything changes.

Customer: Hmm. That actually sounds... okay. What about the $38 overcharge I already paid this month? Can I get that refunded or credited?

Agent: (pause) Let me see what I can do for you. (typing sounds) Since this was due to the promotional period ending, I can apply a one-time account credit of $38 to your account to cover that difference. How does that sound?

Customer: Yeah, that would be great. Thank you.

Agent: Perfect. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to apply that $38 credit to your account right now, and then I'm going to switch you over to the Fiber Standard plan at $79.99 per month for the next 12 months. Your new bill next month should reflect both of these changes. You should see the credit applied, and your new monthly rate will be $79.99. Does that work for you?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds good. Um, one question though. What happens after the 12 months are up?

Agent: That's a great question. After the 12-month promotional period ends, your rate will go to the regular pricing for the Standard plan, which is currently $119.99 per month. However, you'll receive notification about 30 days before your promotion ends, and we can discuss options at that time. You might be eligible for another promotion, or we can look at other plans that might work better for you.

Customer: Okay, I appreciate that. And you said I'm getting faster internet too, right? 200 megs?

Agent: That's right. You'll go from 100 megabits per second to 200. Most customers really notice the difference, especially if you're streaming or have multiple devices connected at the same time.

Customer: That's good. I have been having my roommate over a lot lately, and sometimes the internet feels slow. So this should help.

Agent: Absolutely. I think you'll be really happy with the upgrade. Um, one more thing—sometimes when we make a change like this, it takes a little while for the modem to fully provision the new speeds. If you don't see the improvement within 24 hours, just restart your modem and that should do it.

Customer: Okay, got it. Restart the modem if it's slow. (pause) Alright, I think that covers everything. Thank you for your help, Derek. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: My pleasure, Sarah. I really appreciate you calling in, and I'm sorry you had that surprise with the bill. Your account should be all set now. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it. Have a good one.

Agent: You too, Sarah. Thanks for choosing Frontier, and have a great day!

Customer: Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
