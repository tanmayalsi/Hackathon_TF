Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. I've been with you guys for like three years and my bill was always around $79.99, and now it jumped to like $119 a month. What's going on?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account real quick so I can take a look at what's happening there. (typing sounds) Can I get the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing) Okay, one second here... (pause) Alright, I've got you pulled up. I can see you're on our Frontier Fiber 500 plan. Is that correct?

Customer: Yeah, that's right. I've had that for... I don't know, like two years maybe?

Agent: Perfect. Okay, so looking at your account, I can see that your promotional pricing has expired. You were on an introductory rate of $79.99 per month for the first 12 months, and that period ended last month.

Customer: Wait, what? Nobody told me about that. I didn't get any kind of notification or anything. How is that supposed to be fair?

Agent: I totally hear you. Let me just... (pause) ...check what notes are on your account here. (typing) Okay, so it looks like we did send out notifications. According to our records, we sent a letter about 30 days before the rate change, and there should have been a notice on your bill as well about two months ago.

Customer: Well, I didn't see anything. I check my mail and everything. And I definitely didn't see anything about this on my bill.

Agent: I understand, and I apologize for the confusion. Unfortunately, those notices don't always make it through, and sometimes they end up in spam. But the rate change is legitimate. Your new rate is $119.99 per month for that same 500 Mbps service.

Customer: That's almost a 50% increase though! That's crazy. I could get cable internet from Comcast for like $99 a month.

Agent: (pause) I hear you. I do want to mention that our Fiber service is significantly faster and more reliable than cable, but I understand the cost is a concern. Let me see what options I have available for you.

Customer: Yeah, well, can you just put me back on the promotional price or something? I mean, I've been a loyal customer.

Agent: (typing) That's a great question. Let me look at what promotions we currently have running. (pause) So unfortunately, I don't have access to reactivate the previous promotional pricing, but what I can do is... (typing) ...I can offer you our Fiber 300 plan, which would be $89.99 per month. That would get you 300 Mbps instead of 500.

Customer: So I'm paying more money and getting slower internet? How is that an option?

Agent: No, no, I apologize for the confusion. What I mean is, that's a lower cost option if you wanted to reduce your bill. But I completely understand if that doesn't work for you. Let me see if I can get you a discount on your current plan.

Customer: Okay, yeah, that would be better.

Agent: (typing) (pause) Alright, so I'm looking at what I can do here. I can offer you a $20 per month discount on your Fiber 500 plan for the next 12 months. That would bring your bill down to $99.99 per month instead of $119.99.

Customer: (pause) Can you do better than that?

Agent: Let me see what else I have available. (typing) (longer pause) I can potentially increase that to $25 per month, but that would require me to put in a request to our retention team. I can't guarantee they'll approve it, but I can absolutely submit that for you right now and you should hear back within 24 to 48 hours.

Customer: Why can't you just do it now?

Agent: Unfortunately, discounts above a certain threshold require manager approval, so I just don't have the authority to apply that directly to your account. But I promise you, this would get submitted as a priority request.

Customer: (sigh) So what happens in the meantime? Am I stuck paying the full $119?

Agent: No, good question. I can go ahead and apply the $20 discount right now to your account, effective immediately. That way your next bill will reflect the $99.99 rate. Then, if retention approves the additional $5 off, we can apply that retroactively to your current billing cycle so you wouldn't miss out on any savings.

Customer: Okay... okay, that's... I mean, that's something at least. But I'm still not happy about this whole thing.

Agent: I completely understand. And I really do apologize that we didn't communicate the rate change more clearly to you. Is there anything else I can help clarify about your account or the promotion?

Customer: No, I guess not. Just... when will I hear back about the retention thing?

Agent: Within 24 to 48 business hours, someone from our retention team will reach out to you by phone. They'll either be calling the number on file or they might email you, depending on your contact preferences.

Customer: Alright. Will they be calling this number? (indicates phone number)

Agent: They should be, yes. Let me just verify... (typing) Yes, 555-0147 is your primary contact number, so they'll call you there.

Customer: Okay, fine. I guess I'll wait to hear from them.

Agent: Perfect. And again, your $20 discount is effective immediately, so you should see that reflected on your next statement. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's it.

Agent: Alright, well, thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, and I really do appreciate your loyalty over the years. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
