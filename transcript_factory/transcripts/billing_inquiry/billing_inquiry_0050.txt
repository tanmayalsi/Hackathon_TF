# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I just got charged way more than I usually pay and I don't understand why.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me pull up your account. Can I get the phone number or account number associated with your service?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, one second here... alright, I'm looking at your account for... is this Sarah Chen?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. So what's going on with your bill, Sarah?

Customer: Well, my bill came today and it's $159.99, but I've been paying like $89 a month for the past three years. That's almost double. I didn't authorize any changes or anything, and I don't know where this is coming from.

Agent: Oh wow, I can definitely see why you'd be concerned about that. Let me take a look here... (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account history, and it looks like... ah, I see what happened. Your promotional pricing ended on the first of this month.

Customer: What? What promotional pricing? I was never told about any promotional...

Agent: I understand your frustration. So you were on our Fiber Gigabit plan with a promotional rate of $89.99 that was good for 36 months from when you signed up. And that promotional period ended this month, so your rate has gone back to our standard pricing, which is $159.99 a month.

Customer: (pause) Okay, but... nobody told me this was going to happen. I mean, shouldn't you guys have sent me a notice or something? That's a huge jump.

Agent: That's a really fair point. Let me check your account to see if... (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like we did send out an email notification about 30 days prior to the rate change. Did you happen to see that?

Customer: I... I don't know, maybe? I get so many emails. But still, that doesn't seem fair. You buried it in an email. I've been a customer for three years—why would you just let my rate double without at least calling me or something?

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate your loyalty as a long-time customer. That's three years of great service on your end, and we definitely value that. Here's what I can do for me—let me look at what promotional options I have available for you right now.

Customer: Okay, thank you. I mean, I like the service, it's fast, but I can't afford to pay twice as much.

Agent: (typing sounds) Yeah, that makes sense. So unfortunately, with the promotional period that just ended, I'm not able to re-apply the original 36-month promo at that rate. However, I do have some options here. I can offer you a 12-month promotional rate at $119.99 a month, or... (pause) let me see if there's anything else... I might be able to get you into our 24-month promotion at $99.99 a month.

Customer: $99.99? Okay, that's better than $159, but it's still more than what I was paying before.

Agent: I know, and I hear you. The thing is, the original promotional pricing was really our introductory rate, and that was specific to the time when you signed up. The $99.99 rate is actually a really competitive rate for our gigabit fiber service in your area. Plus, you'd get that locked in for two years, so no surprises after that.

Customer: (hesitating) Well... I mean, what happens after those two years? Do I get hit with another surprise?

Agent: That's a great question. So after the 24-month promotional period ends, your rate would go to our standard pricing, which would be $159.99. However, we could absolutely revisit options with you at that time. Customers usually have access to new promotions, or we can discuss other service options available to you then. We'd reach out to you with plenty of notice before any changes took effect.

Customer: (pause) Okay... okay, I guess that's better than nothing. Can you put me on that $99.99 plan?

Agent: Absolutely, I can do that for you right now. Let me just get that processed. (typing sounds) So I'm applying the 24-month promotional rate of $99.99 per month. Your new rate will be effective immediately on your next billing cycle. You should see that reflected on your bill next month.

Customer: Okay, good. And just so I'm clear—it's definitely going to be $99.99 and not something else, right?

Agent: Yes, I promise. It's locked in at $99.99 per month for the next 24 months. That's guaranteed. And Sarah, I do want to apologize again about the communication around the rate change. I'm going to add a courtesy credit of $35 to your account for this month to help offset some of that increase. It's not perfect, but I want to make sure we're taking care of you.

Customer: Oh! Well, that's... that's actually really nice of you. Thank you.

Agent: Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you taking care of this.

Agent: Great! Well, we really do appreciate your business, Sarah, and thank you for giving us the opportunity to work this out with you. If you ever need anything else, just give us a call. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Bye now!
