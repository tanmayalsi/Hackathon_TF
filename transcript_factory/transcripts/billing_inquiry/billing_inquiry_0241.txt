# Frontier Communications Call Transcript

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, I'm calling because I just got my bill and I'm seeing a charge that I don't think I should be paying for. It's, um... it's more than my usual bill, and I need to figure out what's going on.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having a billing concern. I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. Let me pull that up here... Okay, I'm looking at your account now. Your name is David Connelly, correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Great. So, David, what specific charge are you seeing that concerns you? Do you remember roughly how much your bill was before versus now?

Customer: Yeah, so... my bill was usually around $89 a month, right? For the gigabit fiber plan. And this month it came through at $124. That's like a $35 difference out of nowhere. I haven't changed anything on my account, so I'm wondering if you guys... I don't know, if there was an error or something.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. (pause) Let me take a closer look at the charges here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that on your account... it looks like you were on a promotional rate that expired at the end of last month. Your account shows you were on a one-year promotional offer for $89 a month, and that ended on December 31st.

Customer: Wait, what? I didn't... I mean, I knew there was a promotion, but nobody told me it was expiring. I've been with you guys for three years now.

Agent: I hear you, and I apologize for the confusion. The promotional period did end, which is why you're seeing the rate increase to our standard gigabit rate of $124 a month. That's actually competitive pricing for the service you're receiving, but I understand it can be a shock when the rate changes.

Customer: This is... I mean, this is not great. I'm on a pretty tight budget here, and an extra $35 a month is significant for me. Is there anything you can do? Can you put me back on that promotional rate or... I don't know, offer me something?

Agent: (pause) Let me see what I can do for you. One moment while I check what promotions are currently available for your account. (typing sounds, brief hold with background music)

Agent: Thank you for holding, David. Okay, so I do have some options for you. Because you've been a loyal customer for three years, I can offer you a special retention rate. I can get you back down to $99 a month for the next twelve months. That's still a ten-dollar increase from your promotional rate, but it's better than the $124.

Customer: Hmm... so I'd save... what, like $300 a year compared to the regular price?

Agent: Exactly. You'd be paying $99 versus the standard $124, so that's a $25 monthly savings, or $300 per year.

Customer: I... okay. That's not ideal, but it's better than what I was looking at. Um, can I ask though... after this year, is this going to happen again? Am I going to wake up and see another rate hike?

Agent: That's a fair question. So this retention rate is guaranteed for twelve months. After that, we do have options we can discuss. But I'd recommend giving us a call closer to that date, and we'll see what we can work out. Typically, we do have promotional offers available, and your loyalty to Frontier would definitely be considered.

Customer: Okay... alright. I mean, I guess I'll take the $99 rate. But I want to be clear that I'm not happy about any of this. This was a pretty frustrating experience finding out about the expiration without any notice.

Agent: I absolutely understand, and I apologize again that you didn't receive a clearer notification about the promotional period ending. That's feedback I'll be passing along to our team. Let me just get this rate change processed for you right now. (typing sounds) I'm applying the $99 rate effective immediately. You should see that reflected on your next bill, which would be for January service. Your new statement will show the updated rate going forward for the next year.

Customer: Okay, great. So my next bill should be around $99?

Agent: Yes, exactly. $99 per month for the next twelve months, starting with your January bill. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you today?

Customer: (pause) No, I think... I think that's it. Thanks for working with me on this, Marcus.

Agent: You're very welcome, David. Thank you for being a valued Frontier customer, and I really do apologize for the rate increase. If you have any other questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. You have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
