# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. So I just got my bill and... I'm pretty frustrated right now. My bill went up like thirty dollars and I don't understand why. I've had the same plan for two years.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. The area code is 208.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, great. Let me pull that up here. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account for Sarah Mitchell, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's me.

Agent: Perfect. And you're saying you noticed an increase on your recent bill?

Customer: Yes, it's ridiculous. I called about three months ago and your sales guy said my promotional rate was going to end, but he said it would only go up like ten or fifteen bucks. Now it's gone up almost thirty. That's not what I was told.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at your billing history here. (pause, typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that your promotional rate of $79.99 a month for our 500 Mbps Fiber plan expired on the first of this month. Your new rate is $109.99 per month.

Customer: Right, that's the thirty dollars I'm talking about. But the person I talked to said it would be like fifteen dollars more, not thirty. This is crazy. I need to know what's going on here.

Agent: I completely understand. So looking at the notes on your account, I see there was a call on... November 15th of last year. Let me see what was discussed. (pause) It looks like the agent did note that the rate would increase to $109.99 upon expiration of the promotional period. It appears that may have been miscommunicated as a smaller increase.

Customer: Okay, so someone on your end messed up, and now I'm supposed to just eat the difference?

Agent: I don't want to leave you frustrated. Let me see what options we have here. How long have you been a customer with us?

Customer: Um, like I said, it's been two years. And before that I was with CenturyLink for five years. I've been a pretty loyal customer.

Agent: That's great to know. We really appreciate that loyalty. (pause) So here's what I can do for you. I'm able to apply a retention credit to your account. I can give you a promotional rate again for another twelve months at $84.99 a month. That would be $5 more than your original rate, which is about half of what the new rate would be. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Well, that's better, but... I mean, I'm still paying more than I was. Why should I have to pay more at all if someone on your team told me something different?

Agent: That's a fair point. Let me see if I can do a little better here. (typing sounds, pause) Okay, I'm going to credit your account for the difference on this month's bill, so that charge back to $79.99. And then I can set you up with the $84.99 rate starting next month. That way you're getting a one-time credit, and the new rate is the lowest I'm able to offer for a loyalty customer.

Customer: One month free basically?

Agent: That's correct. The credit will appear on your next bill.

Customer: (pause) I guess... I mean, that's not perfect, but it's better than just getting hit with a thirty dollar surprise. Okay, yeah, I'll do that.

Agent: Great. I really appreciate your flexibility. Let me just confirm those details for you. So I'm applying a credit of $30.03 to your current bill, bringing it back to your promotional rate for this cycle. Starting with your next billing period, you'll be on a twelve-month promotional rate of $84.99 per month for the same 500 Mbps Fiber service. And this promotion runs through... (typing) ...January 31st of next year. Does that all sound correct?

Customer: Yeah, that sounds right. Can you send me a confirmation email or something?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to add a note to your account right now, and you should receive an email confirmation within the next fifteen minutes with all these details. You'll also see the credit reflected on your next billing statement.

Customer: Okay, good. Thanks for taking care of that.

Agent: You're welcome. I apologize again for the confusion with the previous call. If there's anything else I can help you with today, I'm happy to assist.

Customer: No, that's it. I appreciate it.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you for being a loyal Frontier customer, and thanks for calling us today. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too.
