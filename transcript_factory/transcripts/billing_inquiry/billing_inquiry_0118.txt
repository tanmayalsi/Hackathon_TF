# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. It's... it's a lot more than what I was paying before.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: Perfect, thank you. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm pulling up your account now. And your name is...?

Customer: David Chen.

Agent: Got it, David. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account here. I can see you're on our Fiber 400 plan. Can you tell me what you're seeing on your bill that's concerning you?

Customer: Well, my bill was like $79.99 for the last, I dunno, six months or so? And this month it jumped to $129.99. That's a $50 increase! I mean, I didn't agree to that. Nobody called me or anything.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, David. Let me see what happened here. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so looking at your account, it looks like... ah, I see. It appears you were on an introductory rate. That twelve-month promotional period ended on your account about two weeks ago, and you've now moved to our standard pricing for the Fiber 400 service.

Customer: Wait, what? An introductory rate? I... I don't remember signing up for anything like that. I thought that was just the regular price.

Agent: I understand. Let me pull up your account notes here. So when you originally signed up, you were placed on a twelve-month promotional offer at $79.99 per month. That promotion would have expired at the end of this billing cycle.

Customer: But nobody told me it was going to go up. Shouldn't you guys have sent me a notice or something?

Agent: That's a very fair question. We do typically send out a notification about 30 days before a promotional rate expires. Let me check... (typing sounds) Can I ask, have you received any mailings or emails from us in the past month or so?

Customer: Uh, I mean... maybe? I get a lot of mail and I don't always read everything. But like, an email? I check email, and I don't think I got anything from Frontier about this.

Agent: Hmm, let me see here. (pause) It looks like we do have an email address on file for you, and we should have sent a notice there about three weeks ago. It's possible it went to spam, or there could have been a delivery issue on our end. I apologize for that.

Customer: Okay, well, what am I supposed to do now? I can't afford to pay that much. I'm gonna have to look at switching to cable or something.

Agent: I don't want to see you go, David. Let me see what options we have here. (typing sounds) So the standard rate for Fiber 400 is $129.99, which is what you're being charged now. However, we do have some promotional offers available right now for existing customers.

Customer: What kind of offers?

Agent: (typing sounds) Well, I can see that I can offer you a six-month promotional rate. We could get you back down to $89.99 for the next six months. After that, it would go back to the standard rate of $129.99 unless another promotion applies.

Customer: That's still more than what I was paying before.

Agent: I understand it's higher than the original promotional rate, yes. But it's $40 less than what you're currently being charged. We could also... let me see what else is available. (pause) We could also bundle that with our TV service. We have a package that includes Fiber 400 internet plus our Digital TV service for $119.99 for the first year. That would actually save you money compared to what you're paying now.

Customer: I don't really want TV. I just want the internet. Can't you just keep me at the original price?

Agent: (pause) I hear you, and I wish I could do that. Unfortunately, the introductory rate was really meant to be a limited-time offer, and once it expires, the standard rate applies. But I do want to work with you here. Let me see... can I put you on a brief hold while I check with my supervisor about what options might be available?

Customer: Um, yeah, okay. How long?

Agent: Just a couple of minutes, David. I appreciate your patience.

Customer: Alright.

(hold music plays for approximately 90 seconds)

Agent: Thank you for holding, David. I'm back.

Customer: Yeah, I'm here.

Agent: Okay, so I spoke with my supervisor, and we can actually offer you an extended promotional rate. We can give you $99.99 per month for twelve months instead of the standard $129.99. How does that sound?

Customer: So that's... that's like a $30 difference from what I'm paying now?

Agent: Exactly, yes. That brings you down from $129.99 to $99.99. It's still $20 more than your original promotional rate was, but it's a significant savings from what you're currently being charged.

Customer: (pause) Yeah, okay, I... I mean, that's better. But I'm not happy about this, you know? I feel like you guys should have made it clearer that this was temporary.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I apologize that the communication wasn't clearer on our end. I'm making a note on your account right now about the lack of notification. This new rate of $99.99 will start on your next billing cycle, and I can apply a one-time credit of $30 to your current bill to help offset the increase you already saw. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, that helps. That... that's something at least.

Agent: Great. So just to confirm, I'm applying that $30 credit to your account. You should see that reflected on your next bill. Your new rate of $99.99 per month will start next cycle and will remain active for the next twelve months.

Customer: Yeah, okay. I mean, I appreciate you doing that. I'm still not thrilled about this whole situation, but at least it's better.

Agent: I completely understand, and I really do apologize for the frustration this caused. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it.

Agent: Alright, David. Thank you for being a Frontier customer, and I'm sorry we didn't handle this communication better. If you have any issues in the future, don't hesitate to give us a call back. We're here to help.

Customer: Okay, thanks.

Agent: Have a great day!

Customer: You too.
