# Frontier Communications Billing Dispute Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. This is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I was just looking at my statement and... I don't know, something doesn't seem right.

Agent: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... All right, I've got you. And can I confirm the name on the account?

Customer: It's James Martinez.

Agent: Perfect, James. Thanks for confirming that. So you mentioned something on your bill doesn't look right. What's going on?

Customer: Well, my bill jumped up like thirty bucks this month. Last month I was paying 79.99, and now it says 109.99. I didn't change anything or add any services, so... I mean, what's up with that?

Agent: I understand your concern. Let me take a look at your account history here and see what might have caused that change. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account. Can you tell me... have you been with Frontier for a while now?

Customer: Uh, yeah, I've had the service for like three years. I've never had an issue before, and my bill's always been the same.

Agent: Right, right. So looking at your account, I see that you're on our Fiber Internet 500 plan, and it looks like you had an introductory rate that expired. Is that... does that sound familiar?

Customer: (pause) An introductory rate? I mean... I guess? Nobody told me anything about that expiring though. I just opened my bill and boom, thirty dollars more.

Agent: Yeah, I totally understand why that would be frustrating. So what happened is, when you first signed up three years ago, you were put on our promotional pricing for the first twelve months. After that, the rate adjusted to our standard pricing for that speed tier. I can see here that... (typing sounds) ...that adjustment happened this month.

Customer: Okay, but like... why wasn't I notified? Shouldn't you guys have sent me something in the mail or an email or something?

Agent: That's a really fair question. And actually, we should have sent you notification about that rate adjustment. Let me check your contact information here to see... (pause) Do you have an email address on file with us?

Customer: Yeah, it's jmartinez84@emailprovider.com. But I haven't gotten anything from you guys recently.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking here and it looks like you do have that email on file. Hmm. I apologize for that. It's possible that the notification went to spam, or there may have been a delay in the system. Either way, I understand your frustration.

Customer: Right, so what can we do about this? I mean, is this rate locked in now? Can I get the old rate back?

Agent: That's what I want to help you with. So, the promotional rate you had has expired, but I do have some options for you. First, we can put you on a new promotional rate if you'd like. We currently have an offer for Fiber Internet 500 at $69.99 for the first twelve months. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) Wait, so that's actually cheaper than what I was paying before?

Agent: Exactly. Your original promotional rate was $79.99, and this new one would be $69.99 for twelve months. After that, it would go to our standard rate, which is the $109.99 that you're seeing now.

Customer: Okay, so... you're saying if I sign up for this thing, my bill goes down, and then in a year it'll go back up to... what, around the same amount?

Agent: Right, so after twelve months, it would adjust to the standard rate for that service tier, which would be around $109.99 to $114.99 depending on any taxes or fees in your area. But I want to be transparent with you about that upfront so you're not surprised again.

Customer: (pause) Okay. Yeah, I mean... at least that's more honest than what happened before. But is there anything else I can do? Like, is there a way to lock in a better rate permanently or something?

Agent: That's a great question. Unfortunately, our promotional rates do have expiration dates, but what I can do is make a note on your account right now to have our customer retention team reach out to you about a month before this promotion ends. That way, we can discuss other options well in advance, whether that's a different plan, a different speed tier, or potentially another promotional rate if you're eligible.

Customer: (pause) Okay, I mean... that's better than nothing. But I still feel like I should've been told about the rate increase before it happened.

Agent: You know, you're absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize for that. The notification should have reached you. What I can do is, as a goodwill gesture, I can apply a one-time credit to your account for the difference between your promotional rate and the standard rate this month. So that would be about thirty dollars back to your account. Would that help make this right?

Customer: Oh, really? Yeah, that would actually... that would help, yeah.

Agent: Excellent. Let me process that for you right now. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, I'm putting in a credit for $30.00 to your account. You should see that reflected on your next bill. And I'm also going to apply the new promotional rate of $69.99 starting immediately, and I'll add that note about having the retention team reach out to you before the promotion ends.

Customer: Okay, yeah. I appreciate that. That's... that's helpful.

Agent: Great, James. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: Nope, I think that covers it. Thanks for... you know, working with me on that.

Agent: Of course, I'm glad we could get this sorted out for you. Thanks for being a Frontier customer, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, thanks.

Agent: Thank you, bye-bye.

Customer: Bye.
