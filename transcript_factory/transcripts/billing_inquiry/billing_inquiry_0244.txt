# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I need to talk to someone about my bill. I just got charged almost forty dollars more than usual and I have no idea why.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're having a billing issue. I'd be happy to help you look into that. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... And can I get the name on the account, please?

Customer: It's Patricia Moreno.

Agent: Perfect, Patricia. I'm just loading your account now. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your most recent bill from... October 15th. I see a balance of $129.99. Is that the one you're concerned about?

Customer: Yes, that's the one. Last month I was paying $89.99, so suddenly jumping to $130 doesn't make any sense. And honestly, nobody told me there was going to be a price increase.

Agent: I understand your frustration, Patricia. Let me see what happened here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm looking at your account details and... ah, I see. It looks like your promotional pricing period ended. You were on our Fiber 500 package with a twelve-month promotional rate of $89.99 per month, and that promotion expired as of this billing cycle.

Customer: Wait, what? I never agreed to that. I mean, I've had Frontier for like three years now. Why would my price just go up?

Agent: I completely understand why that would be frustrating. Promotional pricing periods do have an expiration date, and typically customers are notified before the promotion ends. Let me check your account to see if we have a record of that notice being sent. (pause, typing sounds) 

So it looks like a courtesy notification was sent out via email about thirty days before the expiration. Did you happen to receive that?

Customer: I mean... maybe? I get so many emails. But I shouldn't have to hunt through my emails trying to find something like that. When I signed up, I thought that was just my price.

Agent: You're right, and I do apologize for the confusion there. That's not a great experience. After your promotional period ends, the package does move to our standard pricing, which for the Fiber 500 is $129.99 per month. However, I do have some options for you.

Customer: Okay, what kind of options?

Agent: Well, first of all, I can apply a service credit to your account for the overcharge, which would be the difference between what you paid and what the standard rate is... that would be forty dollars. But more importantly, I can look at what other promotional offers we might have available for your account right now.

Customer: (pause) Okay, yeah, that would be helpful.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what we have... Alright, so you're currently on Fiber 500, which is a great package. It looks like I can put you back on a promotional rate. We're running a special right now where I can lock you in at $99.99 per month for the next twelve months. That's still less than your original promotional rate, but it's a good deal.

Customer: Really? And this is locked in for a year?

Agent: Yes, ma'am. It's locked in for the full twelve months. After that year expires, it would go back to the standard rate, but at that point, if you call us, we can typically work something out with you or look at other options that might be available at that time.

Customer: Alright, well that's better than a hundred and thirty dollars. And you're also putting that forty dollar credit on my account?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm going to apply a forty dollar service credit for this current billing cycle, and I'm going to activate the new promotional rate effective immediately. So your next bill should reflect the $99.99 rate, and the credit will appear on this month's balance.

Customer: Okay, that sounds fair. Thank you for that.

Agent: You're welcome, Patricia. I want to make sure you don't miss the next notification either. Would it be helpful if I made a note on your account to send you a reminder call about two weeks before your promotional period expires next time?

Customer: Actually, yeah, that would be great. A phone call would be much better than an email that I might miss.

Agent: Perfect. I'm adding that note right now. (typing sounds) You're all set. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: My pleasure, Patricia. Thank you for choosing Frontier, and I apologize again for the confusion with the promotional pricing. You should see those changes reflected on your account within the next 24 hours. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
