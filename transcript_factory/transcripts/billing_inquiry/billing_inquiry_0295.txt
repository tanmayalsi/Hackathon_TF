Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm seeing a charge that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up a lot this month. Like, a significant amount.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to take a look at that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's my account number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, let me pull that up here... One moment, please. (pause) Alright, I've got you here. I'm looking at an account under the name David Martinez?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Agent: Perfect. So I can see your account and your current bill. Can you tell me specifically what charge is concerning you?

Customer: Okay, so first of all, my internet was $79.99 a month, and now it's showing $99.99. That's a twenty dollar increase. I didn't authorize any upgrade or anything. When did that happen?

Agent: Okay, I understand your frustration. Let me look into that for you. (typing sounds) So I'm seeing that on your account... it looks like your promotional pricing expired. You were on a 12-month promotional rate, and that ended at the end of last month. So this month, you've transitioned to our standard pricing for that service tier.

Customer: Wait, what? I wasn't told about this. I mean, I should've gotten a notice or something, right?

Agent: You know, that's a fair point. We do send notices, typically around 30 days before a promotional rate expires. (pause) Let me check if there was a notice sent to you. Did you receive anything in the mail or email?

Customer: I... I might have, honestly. I get so much junk mail and emails. But I mean, shouldn't there be something more prominent about it? Like a call or a text?

Agent: I hear you. And I appreciate that feedback. Standard practice is the written notice, but I completely understand it can be easy to miss. Is the twenty dollar increase the only issue, or was there something else on the bill that stood out to you?

Customer: (pause) Well, there's also like a... a service fee or something that says "Equipment Lease Fee" for $12.99. I don't remember being charged that before, or... I mean, is that something I need to pay? Do I own the modem or am I renting it?

Agent: Good question. So that's for the fiber gateway unit that you're using. If you own that equipment outright, you shouldn't be charged that fee. Let me check your account notes here. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you received that equipment from us, and it looks like you've been on an equipment lease since your service started.

Customer: That doesn't seem right. When I signed up, I thought that was included. The technician just brought it out and installed it.

Agent: I understand. So the equipment lease is typically... well, it is a separate charge. But I want to make sure you have the full picture here. With Frontier, you have the option to either lease the equipment month-to-month, or you can purchase it outright for around $150.

Customer: A hundred and fifty dollars? I mean, I've probably already paid that in lease fees by now, haven't I?

Agent: (pause) Let me see here. Looking at your account history... you've been a customer for about 14 months, so yes, the lease fees would have added up to... roughly around $180 or so at this point.

Customer: Exactly! So that's kind of a raw deal. You're saying I should have just bought it?

Agent: Yeah, I mean, I can see your point. It depends on the individual customer's situation, but in your case with 14 months of service, purchasing would have been the more economical option. I really do apologize for that.

Customer: So what can you do about this? I mean, this is frustrating. I'm basically paying for something I should own by now, and my rate just went up without me really understanding what was happening.

Agent: (pause) Okay, so here's what I can do. First, regarding the rate increase—that's the standard renewal rate, and I can't waive that. However, I do want to help you out. I can actually adjust your pricing. We have a 12-month promotional rate I can apply to your account for $89.99 a month, which is actually $10 cheaper than where you were before.

Customer: Really? How much cheaper is that than the $99.99?

Agent: It would be $10 cheaper, so $89.99 instead of $99.99.

Customer: Oh. Okay, well that's... that's actually decent. What about the equipment fee?

Agent: So, here's what I can do. I can credit you one month of the equipment lease fee—that's the $12.99—as a courtesy for the confusion around the rate increase. But going forward, I'd recommend either continuing with the lease or purchasing the equipment outright. Purchasing would end up being more economical for you in the long run.

Customer: Can you credit me more than one month? I mean, I've been paying for 14 months already.

Agent: I understand, and I appreciate you asking. Unfortunately, I'm limited to one month credit on my end, but I can add a note to your account that you'd like to discuss a larger adjustment. If you'd like, I can connect you with our customer retention team—they sometimes have a bit more flexibility with adjustments.

Customer: (pause) How long would that take? I don't really want to be on the phone much longer.

Agent: I can transfer you right now, and they should be able to pick up pretty quickly. It might be another 5 or 10 minutes though.

Customer: Okay, I... I guess I'll do that. But can you just confirm what you're applying to my account right now?

Agent: Absolutely. So I'm applying the promotional rate of $89.99 per month for the next 12 months, and I'm crediting you $12.99 for this month's equipment lease fee. That credit will show up on your next bill. Does that sound good?

Customer: Yeah, okay. And then the retention team might be able to help with more of the equipment fees?

Agent: Yes, exactly. They can review your account and potentially work something out. They have more tools available to them.

Customer: Alright. Let me transfer you over now. Just stay on the line.

Agent: (pause) (transfer tone) Thank you for holding, and connecting you now.

Customer: Thanks, Derek. I appreciate it.

Agent: You're welcome, David. Thanks for your patience, and thanks for being a Frontier customer.
