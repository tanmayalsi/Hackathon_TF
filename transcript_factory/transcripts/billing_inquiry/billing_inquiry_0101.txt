# FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill this month and my internet rate went up like thirty dollars. I wasn't notified about any price increase, and I want to know what's going on.

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account and take a look at what happened. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0847.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, I've got you here... Let me just... give me one second. (pause) Alright, I'm looking at your account now. I can see your service address is on Maple Street, is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right. So what's the deal with the price increase? I've been a loyal customer for like four years now and I've never had any issues.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I appreciate your loyalty. Let me explain what I'm seeing here. It looks like your promotional rate expired at the end of last month. You were on a promotional pricing plan that was set to end on March 31st, and your rate has now moved to our standard rate for the Fiber 500 service.

Customer: Wait, so you're telling me I was supposed to know this? I didn't get any notification about this. That seems really unfair.

Agent: I understand where you're coming from. Let me check... (typing sounds) ...to see if a notification was sent out. (pause) It looks like we did send a courtesy email notification about thirty days before the expiration, and there should have also been a notice on your bill two months prior. Do you recall seeing anything like that?

Customer: I mean, I might have deleted an email, but... I don't know. I shouldn't have to dig through my emails for this. You guys should make it clearer. And I'm pretty sure my bill didn't have anything about it either, or I would've noticed.

Agent: You know what, I hear you. A lot of customers miss these notifications, and I'm not saying that's your fault. What I can tell you is that the promotional rate was always meant to be temporary. However, I do have some options that might help here.

Customer: Okay, what kind of options?

Agent: Well, first of all, since you've been such a great customer for four years with no service issues, I can apply a one-time courtesy credit to your account for the difference between your old rate and the new rate for this month. That would help offset some of the increase.

Customer: That's something, I guess. But what about going forward? Am I just stuck paying this higher rate now?

Agent: That's a great question. So, we actually have a new promotional offer that I can look into for you. Let me see what's available... (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I can get you into a new twelve-month promotional rate that would bring your bill down to $79.99 per month for our Fiber 500 service. That's actually $15 less than your current rate, and it locks you in for the next year.

Customer: Seventy-nine ninety-nine? What am I paying now?

Agent: Right now, after the increase, you're at $109 per month for the same service tier.

Customer: (pause) So this new deal would actually be cheaper than before the increase even happened?

Agent: Yes, exactly. It's a promotional rate we're running for existing customers. And after the twelve months, I'll make sure to have a note placed on your account so we can reach out to you before it expires and make sure you're aware of any changes or other options available to you at that time.

Customer: Huh. Well, that's better. I mean, I'm still a little frustrated about the whole thing, but... yeah, that works for me.

Agent: Great! I'm glad we could work something out. So just to recap, I'm going to apply that one-time courtesy credit for this month, and I'm going to enroll you in the new promotional rate of $79.99 per month for the next twelve months starting with your next billing cycle. Your new rate will show up on your bill next month.

Customer: Okay. And you're going to put a note about the promotion expiring?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm putting a note right now that we need to contact you thirty days before the expiration on September 30th, so you have plenty of time to make a decision about your service.

Customer: (pause) Alright, I appreciate that. Thank you.

Agent: You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's everything.

Agent: Perfect. Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business. You should see the credit on your account within the next two to three business days. Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now!
