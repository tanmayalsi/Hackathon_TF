# Frontier Communications Customer Service Call

Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yeah, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and honestly, my bill went up like thirty bucks for no reason. I've been a customer for three years and this doesn't make sense.

Agent: I understand your frustration. I'm really sorry you're experiencing that. Let me pull up your account here and take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147. That's the phone number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And just to confirm, is this for the service address on Maple Drive in Riverside?

Customer: Yeah, that's correct.

Agent: Great, I've got you here. So, I'm looking at your current bill and I can see where that increase is coming from. It looks like you were previously on our introductory rate for the first twelve months. That promotional period ended, and your rate adjusted to our standard pricing. You're also showing an additional charge here for... let me see... it looks like a modem rental fee that wasn't on your previous bill.

Customer: A modem rental fee? I don't... I mean, I've had the same modem this whole time. Why would that suddenly show up now?

Agent: That's a great question, and I apologize for the confusion. So what happened is during your promotional period, the modem rental was actually waived as part of the promotion. Now that you've transitioned to our standard plan, that fee is now being applied. It's $9.99 per month.

Customer: That's ridiculous. I own the modem. I didn't rent it. You guys installed it when I signed up.

Agent: (pause) I understand. Let me look into this a little further for you. One second... (typing sounds) Okay, so according to our records, the modem was provisioned to your account as a rental unit. But I hear what you're saying, and I don't blame you for being frustrated. Let me see what options we have here.

Customer: I mean, come on. I've been paying for internet for three years. I think I deserve better than this.

Agent: You absolutely do, and I appreciate your loyalty. You know what, let me talk to my supervisor really quickly about this. Can I put you on a brief hold?

Customer: Sure, okay.

Agent: (hold music plays briefly, about 20 seconds)

Agent: Hey, I'm back. Thanks for holding. So I spoke with my supervisor, and here's what I can do for you. We can go ahead and credit the modem rental fee for this month and the previous month since it wasn't clearly communicated that this would be added. That's about $20 in credits.

Customer: Okay, that's... that's something. But what about going forward? I mean, is this fee going to keep showing up every month?

Agent: Yes, unfortunately it would continue on at $9.99 per month as part of the standard plan. However, I can look at some alternative options. We do have a plan where you can purchase the modem outright for $99, and then the rental fee goes away completely. Or, if you want to keep the rental arrangement, we have a few promotional offers I could apply to help offset some of these costs. We have a three-month promotion where we'd reduce your internet speed tier pricing by $10 a month.

Customer: (sighs) How much is the speed tier I'm on anyway?

Agent: You're currently on our 300 megabit plan, which is $69.99 per month at the standard rate. The promotional pricing would bring that down to $59.99 for the next three months.

Customer: And then it goes back up to $69.99 after three months?

Agent: That's correct, yes. Unless we're able to work out something else at that point.

Customer: Ugh, okay. I mean... can I think about it? Do I need to decide right now?

Agent: No, no, absolutely not. You've got time. But I do want to make sure we get those credits applied to your account. Let me go ahead and process that right now. (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm crediting back $19.98 for the two months of modem rental fees. That should show up on your account within 24 hours. You'll see it as a credit on your next bill.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate that.

Agent: And here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to add a note to your account about this situation and the promotional options we discussed. If you want to go ahead with the plan purchase or the promotional rate, just give us a call back and reference this note, and it should be pretty straightforward. Or if you have any other questions, you can reach out anytime.

Customer: Yeah, okay. Thank you. I mean, I still think this is a bit much, but at least you're helping me out here.

Agent: I totally understand, and I really do apologize for the frustration this has caused. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, I think that's it. Thanks.

Agent: Thank you so much for being a Frontier customer, and we really do appreciate your business. Have a great day.

Customer: You too.

Agent: Bye now.

Customer: Bye.
