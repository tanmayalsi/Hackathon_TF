Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I just got my bill and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize. Well, actually I do recognize it, but I wasn't expecting it, and I think it might be a mistake.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you look into this. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, and what name is this account under?

Customer: Linda Morrison.

Agent: Perfect, Ms. Morrison. I've got your account here. Now, what charge are you seeing that you're concerned about?

Agent: (pause) Are you still there?

Customer: Oh, sorry, yeah. I'm looking at the bill right now. It says there's a charge for... "Advanced Wi-Fi Pro Package" for $19.99 a month. I never signed up for that. I've got the standard router that you guys gave me, and I don't need any advanced package or whatever this is.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let me take a look at what's showing on your account here. (typing sounds) So it looks like this Advanced Wi-Fi Pro Package was added to your account about... three weeks ago. Do you remember authorizing that, or is this definitely something you didn't request?

Customer: No, I definitely did not request that. And honestly, I don't even know what it does. I just want it removed. This is the second time this year something like this has happened. Last time it was some premium channel I wasn't watching.

Agent: I appreciate your frustration, Ms. Morrison. Let me explain what happened here. It looks like this may have been added during a promotional offer when you or someone on the account may have visited our website. Sometimes these can get added if you're browsing different service tiers.

Customer: Well, I didn't do that intentionally. And even if I did click on something, I shouldn't have been charged without me explicitly confirming it. That's not right.

Agent: You know what, you're absolutely right about that. And I apologize for the inconvenience. The good news is that I can definitely remove this charge for you right now. But before I do that, let me ask—are you happy with your current internet service? I want to make sure you're getting what you need.

Customer: The internet is fine. The speeds are good. It's just... I feel like every month there's something new being added that I didn't ask for, and I'm tired of it. My bill keeps going up.

Agent: (pause) I hear you. And actually, that brings up something I'm seeing here. Your base service rate has also increased by $12 per month, effective with this billing cycle. That would be a separate charge from the Wi-Fi package.

Customer: Wait, what? My rate went up? By how much?

Agent: It looks like your service increased from $59.99 to $71.99 per month. This typically happens after a promotional rate expires or when there are infrastructure improvements in your area.

Customer: Are you kidding me right now? So my bill went up $12, and then there's another $20 charge added on top of that? That's almost $32 more than what I was paying. I've been with Frontier for four years. Don't you guys have any loyalty programs or... I don't know, something?

Agent: (typing sounds) That's a great question. Let me see what options I have available for you. (pause) So here's what I can do. First, I'm going to remove that Advanced Wi-Fi Pro Package immediately, so that's the $19.99 going away. Second, I can see that you're eligible for a service credit. I can apply $15 off your bill for the next three months as a courtesy, given that you've been a loyal customer.

Customer: So I still have the $12 rate increase though?

Agent: Unfortunately, the rate increase is part of your service plan and I'm not able to adjust that. However, with the $15 monthly credit for three months, that would offset most of that increase for now. And let me look into what promotional offers might be available to you once that credit expires. I can even have someone reach out to you about that.

Customer: (sighs) Okay, but that's only temporary, right? What happens after three months?

Agent: After three months, the credit would expire, and yes, your bill would go back to the increased rate unless we find a different promotion to move you to. But honestly, given your loyalty, I think there may be some options. The outreach team can discuss what current promotions apply to existing customers.

Customer: Alright. And you're removing that Wi-Fi package thing right now?

Agent: Absolutely. Let me process that for you. (typing sounds) Done. That charge has been removed, effective immediately. You should see that reflected on your next billing cycle. And I'm also applying that $15 monthly credit starting with your next bill. Is there anything else I can help clarify for you?

Customer: No, I think... I think that's it. I appreciate you helping me out with this, Derek. I just... I wish these things didn't happen so often.

Agent: I completely understand, Ms. Morrison. And I apologize on behalf of Frontier that you've had these experiences. You should be getting a call from our retention team within the next week or so about additional offers. But in the meantime, if you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Is there a best number to reach you at?

Customer: The number on the account is fine.

Agent: Perfect. Well, thank you for being a valued Frontier customer, and again, I'm sorry for the frustration. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks, Derek.

Agent: Thank you, Ms. Morrison. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
