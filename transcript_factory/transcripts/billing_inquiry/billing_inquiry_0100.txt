Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, yes, um, I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I don't recognize, and I'm pretty sure my rate went up too. I'm not happy about this.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. I'm sorry you're experiencing billing issues. Let me pull up your account so we can take a look at what's going on. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's... hold on, let me find my bill. Okay, it's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Perfect, thank you. And can I get the name on the account?

Customer: It's Patricia Chen.

Agent: (typing sounds) Alright, Patricia, I've got your account here. I'm looking at your most recent bill from... looks like it's from last month. Can you tell me specifically what charge you're concerned about? Is it the total amount that's different, or is there a line item that's new?

Customer: Well, both, actually. Last month I was paying $79.99 for the Fiber 300 plan, and this month it's showing $94.99. That's a fifteen dollar increase! And then there's also this charge... (pause) it says "Equipment Rental Fee - Modem Upgrade" for $12.99. I didn't ask for any equipment upgrade, and why am I being charged for something I didn't agree to?

Agent: Okay, I hear you. Those are two separate issues then. Let me address those for you. (pause) So first, regarding the price increase on your Fiber 300 plan—do you know approximately how long you've had that plan with us?

Customer: Um, I think it's been about two years? Maybe a little longer. I've had pretty good rates until now.

Agent: Right, so you were likely on a promotional rate when you signed up. Typically those promotional periods are 12 to 24 months, and once that period ends, your rate adjusts to our standard pricing for that service level. It looks like your promotional period ended last month, which is why you're seeing the increase. I want to be transparent about that.

Customer: Wait, so you're just... allowed to raise my bill without notifying me? That seems kind of shady.

Agent: I understand how that feels, Patricia. You should have received a notice about this rate change. Let me check... (typing sounds) ...about 30 days before your promotional period ended. It would have come via email and also in your bill. Did you happen to see anything like that?

Customer: (pause) Well... I mean, I get a lot of emails. I might have missed it. But still, that doesn't really address the problem, does it?

Agent: Fair point. Here's what I can do for you. I can actually offer you a new promotional rate that would bring you down to $84.99 per month for the next 12 months. That's not quite the $79.99 you were paying before, but it's a significant savings from the $94.99, and it locks in that rate for another year. Would that be helpful?

Customer: (pause) Okay... I guess that's better than nothing. What about the modem upgrade charge though? I definitely did not request that.

Agent: Let me look into that for you. (typing sounds) (pause) Okay, so I'm seeing here that you were automatically upgraded to our newer Frontier Quantum Gateway modem about six weeks ago. This was part of a service improvement initiative we did in your area to enhance network performance. However, if you didn't authorize this upgrade, I can actually remove that recurring charge from your account.

Customer: Wait, so you're charging me a monthly fee for equipment that I didn't ask for and didn't know I had?

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for that. That should have been communicated to you before the upgrade occurred. I'm going to take care of this right now. I'm removing the $12.99 equipment rental fee, effective immediately, and I'm also going to credit your account for the two months you were already charged—that's $25.98. You'll see that appear on your next billing cycle.

Customer: Okay, well... thank you for that, at least. So just to confirm, my new rate is $84.99?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. $84.99 per month for your Fiber 300 plan, and that rate is guaranteed for the next 12 months. After that 12-month period, I'd recommend reaching out to us so we can review your options and potentially find another promotion to keep your rate competitive.

Customer: And you're removing the equipment fee?

Agent: Absolutely. That's being removed as of today, and you'll receive a credit of $25.98 for the previous charges. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: (pause) No, I think that covers it. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: It's my pleasure, Patricia. I'm truly sorry for the confusion and frustration with the billing. If you have any other questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can always call us back, or you can manage your account through the Frontier app or our website. Thank you for being a Frontier customer.

Customer: Thanks. Have a good day.

Agent: You too, Patricia. Thank you for calling Frontier.
