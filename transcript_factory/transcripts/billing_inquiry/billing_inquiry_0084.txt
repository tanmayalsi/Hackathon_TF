Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and I'm pretty upset about it. My rate just went up, and I wasn't notified about this beforehand.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: It's 555-0147.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. Let me pull that up here... And what's the name on the account?

Customer: James Martinez.

Agent: Perfect, James. I've got your account open. So you're saying you received a rate increase on your bill? Let me just take a look at your billing history here...

Customer: Yeah, I was paying $79.99 a month for my Fiber 500 plan, and now suddenly it's jumped to $94.99. That's a fifteen dollar increase! I've been a customer for... I don't know, three years now? And nobody told me this was coming.

Agent: (pause) I understand your concern, James. I'm looking at your account now. You're right—I can see the rate did change on your current billing cycle. Can I ask, have you received any notices in the mail from us in the past 30 days?

Customer: I mean, maybe? I get a lot of mail. But that's not really the point. The point is that if there's going to be a rate increase, customers should be notified before it happens, not after they're already charged.

Agent: You're absolutely right, and I appreciate you bringing this up. So what typically happens is we do send out a notice about 30 days before any rate change goes into effect. It's usually included with your bill or sent separately. But I want to make sure you were properly notified. Let me check the notes on your account.

(typing sounds)

Customer: While you're checking that, can you also explain to me why the rate went up at all? I'm not getting any new services or anything.

Agent: That's a fair question. (pause) Okay, so according to the system here, you should have received a notice dated June 15th regarding a rate adjustment effective July 1st. The rate increase applies to your service area and is related to infrastructure maintenance and network upgrades we're doing in your region. It's across all our plans in that area.

Customer: Infrastructure maintenance? I mean, that's... that's pretty vague. And I'm telling you, I didn't see any notice. Or if I did, I missed it.

Agent: I hear you. And look, I can see that this is definitely frustrating. Unfortunately, I'm not able to reverse the rate increase on my end—that's a broader pricing decision. But what I can do is... let me see what options might be available to you.

(typing sounds)

Customer: What do you mean, options?

Agent: Well, let me ask you this—are you still happy with the Fiber 500 speed, or would you consider... let me check... we do have a Fiber 300 plan available at $69.99 a month, which would actually be less than what you were paying before.

Customer: So you're asking me to downgrade just to avoid paying more money? That doesn't seem right.

Agent: I understand how it sounds, and I'm not trying to push you in any direction. I'm just trying to find a solution that works for you. Another option is that I could apply a promotional credit to your account. I can't make this go away entirely, but I might be able to get you a partial credit for the first few months at the new rate.

Customer: How much of a credit are we talking about?

Agent: (pause) Let me check what I'm authorized to do here... (typing sounds) I can apply a $25 credit to your account, which would reduce your next bill. That would bring it down to $69.99 for this month.

Customer: So one month? And then what, I'm back to paying $94.99?

Agent: For that one billing cycle, yes. After that, you'd be at the regular rate. However, if you'd like to discuss a long-term solution, I can transfer you to our retention department. They sometimes have access to longer-term promotional rates that I don't have available.

Customer: (sighs) You know what, that might actually be helpful. But I'm also going to look at other providers, just so you know. I've been hearing good things about some of the competitors in my area.

Agent: I completely understand, and I appreciate your business over the past three years. Let me just get you transferred to retention real quick. They'll be able to work with you on some options. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Yeah, sure.

Agent: Thank you. (pause) Okay, I'm getting you connected now. Your reference number for this call is 8847592. Have a great day, James.

Customer: Thanks.

(hold music plays briefly)

Agent 2: Hi James, this is Sandra from our retention team. Derek filled me in on your situation. I'd love to see what we can do to keep you as a valued Frontier customer. Do you have a few more minutes to talk?

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Agent 2: Great. So Derek mentioned you've been with us for about three years on the Fiber 500 plan. And you're interested in either bringing that rate back down or exploring what else might be available?

Customer: Both, ideally. I mean, if you can get me back to what I was paying, that would be ideal. But I'm open to hearing what promotional rates you might have.

Agent 2: Perfect. Let me see what I can put together for you...
