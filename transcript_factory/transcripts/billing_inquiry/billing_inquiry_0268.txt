Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hey, yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and... I don't know, something doesn't look right. My bill went up like thirty bucks and nobody told me about it.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I grab your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Customer: Yeah, it's 555-0147. And my name is Jennifer Martinez.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, Jennifer, let me pull that up here... All right, I'm seeing your account. So you're saying your bill increased this month?

Customer: Yeah, significantly. Last month I paid like $79.99 and this month it's showing $109.95. That's almost a thirty-dollar jump. I've had the same plan for two years. Why would it suddenly go up that much?

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at what's on your account here. (pause) (typing sounds) Okay, so I'm seeing that you were on our promotional rate for the Frontier Fiber 500 plan. That promotional period was set to expire on the last billing cycle.

Customer: What? What promotional rate? I don't remember signing up for anything promotional. I thought this was just my regular plan.

Agent: I know, these things can be confusing. Let me just explain what happened. When you first signed up, you received a promotional rate of $79.99 per month for twelve months, and that period just concluded. So your rate has now adjusted to the regular pricing, which is $109.95 for that same Fiber 500 plan.

Customer: (sighs) But nobody called me to tell me this was going to happen. I mean, wouldn't you guys send a notification or something?

Agent: That's a fair point. Let me check here... (typing sounds) Okay, so it looks like we did send out a notification via email about thirty days prior to your rate adjustment. It should have gone to the email address on file, which shows as j.martinez.1987@... is that still your current email?

Customer: Well, I mean... I don't know. I get a lot of emails. I probably missed it. But the point is, I don't think it's fair to just triple my bill without at least a phone call or something more obvious. And honestly, I could probably get better rates with another provider anyway.

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from. And I appreciate your loyalty these past two years. Let me see what I can do here. (pause) (typing sounds) So, we do have some options. I can offer you an extended promotional rate if you're willing to sign up for a new two-year agreement. I could get you back down to... let me see... $89.99 per month for the first twelve months.

Customer: $89.99? That's still ten dollars more than what I was paying before.

Agent: I know it's not exactly the same, but it's a significant savings compared to the regular rate of $109.95, and it locks you in at that price for a full year. After that, the rate would be $99.99 per month for the remainder of your agreement. But honestly, with the market rates right now, that's a pretty competitive offer.

Customer: (pause) ...What about just going back to the original price? I mean, I've been a good customer. I pay my bill on time every month. Don't you have anything for loyal customers?

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me see what I can do... Yeah, I'm looking at your account here and I can see you've been with us since 2022 and you don't have any late payments. That's excellent. (pause) Okay, so I can actually offer you a loyalty credit. I can reduce your rate to $94.99 for the next six months, which would help bridge that gap. And then after that, if you'd like to re-up your agreement, I can lock in that $89.99 rate I mentioned for another year.

Customer: So $94.99 for six months, and then $89.99 for a year after that? If I agree to a two-year thing?

Agent: Exactly right. And that way you're gradually stepping up instead of having that big jump all at once. Does that sound more reasonable?

Customer: (pause) Yeah, I mean... that's better. That's actually not too bad. Can you explain what happens after that two-year thing is done? Like, am I gonna get hit with another huge bill increase?

Agent: That's a great question. So after your two-year agreement ends, we'd reach out to you about thirty days before with renewal options. At that point, we might have different promotions available, or we can sit down—well, talk on the phone—and work out another rate that makes sense for both of us. The key is that we'll make sure you're aware of what's coming, and we can avoid these surprises.

Customer: Okay. And you're gonna send me something in writing confirming all this, right? This rate reduction and the agreement?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll email you a summary of these changes right now, and you should also see it reflected on your next bill. We'll also send you the formal agreement terms. You'll have about thirty days to review everything. If you change your mind for any reason, you can call us back. But does this work for you?

Customer: Yeah, okay. Yeah, that works. I appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: You're very welcome, Jennifer. And I do apologize again for the confusion with the promotional period ending. We could definitely do a better job with communication there, so I appreciate the feedback. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's... that's it. Thank you.

Agent: Great. Well, thank you for choosing Frontier, and thank you for being such a great customer. You have a wonderful day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now. (call ends)
