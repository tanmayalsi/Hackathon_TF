Agent: Thank you for calling Frontier Communications. My name is Derek. How can I help you today?

Customer: Yeah, hi. I'm calling because I got my bill yesterday and there's a charge on here that I absolutely do not recognize. It's for like, forty-five dollars, and I have no idea where it came from.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your account, please?

Customer: It's 555-0847. That's my landline number.

Agent: (typing sounds) Okay, thank you. Let me pull that up here. And what's the name on the account?

Customer: It's Patricia Molina. M-O-L-I-N-A.

Agent: Perfect, Patricia. I've got your account right here. Okay, so I'm looking at your most recent bill from last month. Can you tell me what date the charge appeared?

Customer: It's on this month's bill. So that would be... I got it yesterday, so... the billing date is March 15th. There's a $45 charge that says "Equipment Fee" but I'm not... I mean, I've had the same router for like three years. Why would there suddenly be an equipment fee?

Agent: (pause) Hmm, that's a good question. Let me take a look at the details here. (typing sounds) Okay, I'm seeing that charge. So the Equipment Fee is typically applied when there's a new modem or router issued to an account. Did you happen to receive any equipment from us recently, or did you request any tech support that might have involved sending out a device?

Customer: No, absolutely not. I didn't request anything. I haven't called Frontier in... I don't know, probably over a year. And I definitely did not receive any equipment at my house.

Agent: Okay, I understand your frustration. Let me look into this a bit further. (typing sounds) Actually, I'm noticing something here. It looks like there was a service call scheduled to your address on March 10th. Did a technician come out to your house at all?

Customer: Oh! Yes, actually, now that you mention it, someone did come out. But that was just to... he came to look at the lines outside because I was having some issues with my connection dropping. He didn't leave me anything or swap out any equipment. He just looked at the outside lines and said everything looked fine.

Agent: Got it. So no equipment was physically left at your home?

Customer: No. Nothing. He came, looked around, and left. That's it.

Agent: Okay, that's really helpful information, Patricia. What I'm seeing here is that the Equipment Fee might have been applied in error during that service call. Sometimes our systems will auto-generate a charge if certain notes are added to the account. Let me... (pause) let me speak with my supervisor about this. Can you hold for just one moment?

Customer: Sure, I'll hold.

Agent: (hold music plays, approximately 45 seconds)

Agent: Thank you so much for holding, Patricia. I've reviewed this with my supervisor, and we're in agreement that this charge should not have been applied. Since no equipment was issued or left at your residence, I'm going to go ahead and remove that $45 charge from your account right now.

Customer: Oh, great! Thank you so much. I was really upset about that because my bill went up, and I thought maybe I was being charged for something I didn't even know about.

Agent: I completely understand. And actually, that brings up something I wanted to check with you. You mentioned your bill went up. Is that aside from this equipment fee, or...?

Customer: Well, with that charge, yeah, it's higher than usual. But even without it, I feel like my bill has been creeping up over the past few months. I'm paying like $89.99 now, and when I first signed up for this service, I was paying $69.99. That was only like... two years ago.

Agent: (typing sounds) Let me pull up your billing history here. (pause) Okay, so I'm looking back at your account. You're right. You signed up in March of 2022 at our promotional rate of $69.99 for twelve months. That promotion ended, and your rate went to $79.99, which is our standard rate for the 300 Mbps fiber package. And then this month, it appears there was another adjustment to $89.99.

Customer: What? Why? What changed this month?

Agent: Let me look into that. (typing sounds) I see there was a price adjustment made on your account on March 1st. It looks like that was related to... (pause) actually, it seems there was a service plan modification. Did you happen to change your service level at any point?

Customer: No, I didn't change anything. I haven't touched my account settings since I set it up.

Agent: Okay, so I'm not seeing any notes that would explain this particular increase. You know what, let me be honest with you, Patricia. Sometimes these adjustments happen on our end, and they're not always clearly documented. But I want to make this right. Let me see what I can do here.

Customer: Okay... so what does that mean?

Agent: Well, I can apply a promotional credit back to your account. We do have a loyalty program for customers like yourself who've been with us for a couple of years. I can offer you our 300 Mbps fiber package at $74.99 per month for the next twelve months. How does that sound?

Customer: (pause) That's better than what I'm paying now, but it's still more than what I was originally paying.

Agent: I know. And I apologize for that. The original promotional rate we offered was limited-time only, and now that we've launched our fiber network in your area more fully, our pricing structure has shifted. But $74.99 is definitely our best rate for existing customers right now.

Customer: (sigh) Well, I guess that's better. But I'm not happy about paying more than I was before.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I want to acknowledge that. Look, what I'm going to do is this: I'm removing that $45 equipment charge, I'm setting you up with the promotional rate of $74.99 per month for the next twelve months, and I'm also going to credit back the difference between what you should have been paying and what you were charged on this month's bill. So that'll be about $15 back to your account.

Customer: Oh, okay. That's... that's helpful. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome. So to recap: your new monthly rate will be $74.99 starting with your next billing cycle on April 15th. That credit of $15 should appear on your account within one to two business days, and the $45 equipment fee has been removed. Does that all sound good?

Customer: Yes, that sounds good. I really appreciate you working with me on this.

Agent: Of course. That's what I'm here for. And Patricia, just so you know, if you have any other billing concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. We want to make sure you're happy with your service.

Customer: Alright, thank you. I will.

Agent: Great. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's everything. Thanks again.

Agent: Thank you so much for calling Frontier Communications, Patricia. Have a great day.

Customer: You too. Bye.

Agent: Bye now.
